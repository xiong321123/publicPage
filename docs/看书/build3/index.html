Fuck Massages
Beware of too many perks. Taking care of employees is 100 percent your responsibility. Distracting and coddling them is not. The cold war of ever-escalating perks between startups and modern big tech has convinced many companies that they need to serve three gourmet meals a day and offer free haircuts to attract employees. They do not. And they should not.</p><p>Keep in mind there’s a difference between benefits and perks:</p><p>Benefit: Things like a 401(k), health insurance, dental insurance, employee savings plans, maternity and paternity leave—the things that really matter and can make a substantive impact on your employees’ lives.</p><p>Perk: An occasional pleasant surprise that feels special, novel, and exciting. Free clothes, free food, parties, gifts. Perks can be completely free or subsidized by the company.</p><p>Getting benefits right is crucially important for your team and their families. You want to support the people you work with and make their lives better. Benefits allow your team and their families to stay healthy and happy and achieve their financial goals. This is where you should be spending your money.</p><p>Perks are a very different matter. In and of themselves, perks are not a bad thing. Surprising and delighting your team is wonderful and often necessary. But when perks are always free, appear constantly, and are treated like benefits, your business will suffer. An oversupply of perks hurts a company’s bottom line and, contrary to popular belief, employee morale. Some people can become obsessed with what they can get rather than what they can do—believing perks to be a right, not a privilege. Then when times get tough or when the perks don’t scale, they become outraged that their “rights” are being taken away.</p><p>And if the primary way you’re attracting talent is through perks, then times will absolutely get tough.</p><hr><p>A friend once proudly told me, “I bring my wife flowers every week.”</p><p>He expected my admiration, I think. What romance! What generosity!</p><p>I said, “What?! I would never do that.”</p><p>I bring my wife flowers from time to time, but it’s always a surprise.</p><p>If you constantly give someone flowers, after a few weeks they won’t be nearly as special. After a few months she’ll barely give them a second thought. Every week she’ll steadily lose interest.</p><p>Until the moment you stop.</p><p>You should absolutely do nice things for your employees. You should surely reward them for their hard work. But you have to remember how the human brain works. There’s a psychology to entitlement.</p><p>If you want to give employees a perk, keep in mind two things:</p><p>When people pay for something, they value it. If something is free, it is literally worthless. So if employees get a perk all the time, then it should be subsidized, not free.
If something happens only rarely, it’s special. If it happens all the time, the specialness evaporates. So if a perk is only received occasionally, it can be free. But you should make it very clear that this is not going to be a regular occurrence and change up the perk so it’s always a surprise.
There’s a huge difference between giving people free food all the time, free food occasionally, and subsidizing food. There’s a reason Apple provides subsidized meals rather than free ones. There’s a reason you can get discounted products, but not free ones, when you work there. Steve Jobs almost never gave out free Apple products as gifts. He didn’t want employees to devalue the very things they were working on. He believed if they are worthwhile and important, then you should treat them as such.</p><p>At Google, all employees used to get a holiday present of a free Google product every year. A phone or a laptop or Chromecast—something substantial. And every year, people moaned and complained—that’s not what I wanted, that feels cheap, last year’s was better. And then when they didn’t get a present one year, there was outrage. How dare they not get us a gift! We always get gifts!</p><p>Free will screw you every time. Getting a really great deal on something creates a completely different mindset than expecting to get it for nothing.</p><p>Subsidizing perks rather than giving them away is obviously much better financially for your business, too. Companies that bubble-wrap their employees with tons of free perks are usually shortsighted and have no long-term strategy to sustain those perks, or they have an innately problematic core business and the perks are the cover. Facebook famously takes great care of its employees, but it also makes all its money selling customer data to advertisers. If Facebook changed its business model, their profitability would take an enormous hit and all those perks would disappear.</p><p>The trend of giving employees everything they could possibly want or need at the office originally started with Yahoo and Google. The idea came from a good, noble, honorable place—a desire to take care of people, an urge to make their company welcoming and fun. It was designed to make the office feel like college, better than college—a soft, comfortable place that you could settle into. And because Google has been making money hand over fist for so long (by selling its customers to advertisers, of course), the rest of the world thought this culture must be part of the reason. So the culture spread. Now the vast majority of startups in Silicon Valley offer gourmet meals, endlessly filled kegs, yoga classes, free massages.</p><p>But unless you have Google profit margins and revenue growth, you should not be giving Google perks.</p><p>Google shouldn’t even be giving Google perks.</p><p>They’ve been trying to cut costs for years—they even started giving people smaller plates in their cafes to encourage them to take less food and cut down on waste. But once you set the precedent and shift people’s expectations, it’s almost impossible to claw your way back.</p><p>In the early days of Nest we had some snacks and drinks in the kitchen—mostly fruit. No packaged junk food. Why poison your talent? Once or twice a week we’d get the team tacos or sandwiches or something a little fancier for lunch. Once in a while someone would light the barbecue out back and people would stick around for dinner.</p><p>But with the Google acquisition came Google food. We built an enormous, beautiful cafe that served free breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day. Five or six different food stations offered different cuisines and menus and there were fresh pastries every morning. Cookies and cakes everywhere. Everyone thought it was really great. But it was really, really expensive.</p><p>After the skyrocketing costs of Alphabet, we tried to trim down some of the options at the cafe. Still plenty of amazing food but no more pho station. No more mini-muffins. There was immediate protest, a universal “What the hell? You can’t take our mini-muffins!”</p><p>It was almost as bad as when we had to outlaw takeout containers after we realized a ton of people weren’t staying late to work—they were hanging out until dinner, then shoveling a full meal into to-go boxes for their families and taking off.</p><p>The whole point of serving dinner was to reward employees who were working incredibly hard. But because it was free, people took advantage of it. It’s free! It’s ours! What’s the big deal?</p><p>A couple of years before that, Taco Tuesday had been a treat. People were delighted when the fruit box got delivered. But now there was a new precedent.</p><p>And a new sense of entitlement.</p><p>I once saw a person stand up at TGIF, Google’s weekly all-hands meeting—literally a meeting of tens of thousands of people—and complain that their preferred yogurt had disappeared from the micro-kitchens. These snack centers are required by Google to ensure that no employee ever has to walk farther than two hundred feet in search of food. This person felt it was their right, nay, their responsibility, to complain directly to the CEO, with all of Google as witness. About yogurt. Free yogurt. Why is the brand I like not within arm’s reach? When is it coming back?</p><p>Just as any good and giving person can get taken advantage of, can be abused, so too can the good intentions of a company. Some people just take and take and take and believe it to be their right. And after a while the culture of the company evolves to accept that and even encourage it.</p><p>That’s why I said, “Fuck massages.”</p><p>When Google acquired Nest, I reluctantly approved the “all the time” free food and buses. They were part of working at Google, everyone already expected them, and they were genuinely helpful to our employees. I knew it would mean a cultural shift—I just hoped everyone would remember our scrappy roots. When we announced the Google acquisition to the team, I literally presented a slide that simply said, “Don’t change.” What got us there was exactly what we needed to continue. Just because we were changing investors didn’t mean we should change our culture or what made us successful.</p><p>When Google gave us new, gorgeous, high-end office space after the acquisition, I thanked Larry Page. I said it was very beautiful. And I told him—and our team—that we didn’t deserve it.</p><p>It felt wrong. We hadn’t earned it yet. That building was meant for a profitable company that had already proven itself. It was meant for people who could relax and spend their time arguing about who was going to get the window seat, who’d get the best view. But that’s not what Nest was about. We were focused on our mission, on staying late and solving problems and working hard and fighting through and over and around every obstacle in our path.</p><p>I wanted everyone to keep their focus on the things we were making, the vision we were trying to achieve. Not perks, not frills, not extras.</p><p>So there was no goddamn way that we were going to spend company money giving people free massages.</p><p>We needed that money—to build the business. To reach net margins. To make better products. To make sure our fundamentals were strong and sound so that we could keep employing all these people in the first place. And we needed it to help people have the life they wanted outside work. Instead of making the office so luxe that employees would never leave, we spent our money on meaningful benefits for them and their families—better health care, IVF, the stuff that really changes people’s lives.</p><p>When we handed out perks, I wanted them to be purposeful in the same way. So we didn’t try to trap people in the office—we rewarded employees by paying for dinner out with their families, or a weekend away. And we were happy to throw serious cash at stuff that genuinely improved people’s experience, that brought them together and exposed them to new ideas and cultures and turned coworkers into friends. Anyone at Nest could join a club and request money to do something cool—barbecues for the whole company, a Holi celebration that painted half the parking lot, paper airplane battles that got more and more elaborate every week.</p><p>But as more Googlers joined our ranks and Nest employees started understanding what kinds of perks were typical at Google, there was a huge internal debate about what people were and weren’t getting. Why did Googlers get massages? Why did they get more buses so they could come in late and leave after lunch? Why did they get 20 percent time (Google’s famous promise to employees that they can devote a fifth of their time to other Google projects outside their regular jobs)? We want 20 percent time!</p><p>I said it wasn’t happening. We needed 120 percent from everyone. We were still trying to build our platform and become a profitable business. Once we got there, we could talk about employees using Nest money to work on Google projects, get a free massage, and end their workday at 2:30 p.m. As you can imagine, my positions weren’t popular with the new employees.</p><p>But there was no way I was going to let entitlement creep in when there was still so much left to do. I wasn’t going to parcel out more perks just because Google employees were used to them.</p><p>The experience of being a Google employee is not normal. It’s not reality. Clive Wilkinson, the architect of the massive, luxurious Googleplex, has even come to recognize it. He now calls his most famous work “fundamentally unhealthy.” “Work-life balance cannot be achieved by spending all your life on a work campus. It’s not real. It’s not really engaging with the world in the way most people do,” he said. <!-- -->[See also: Reading List: Architect behind Googleplex now says it’s “dangerous” to work at such a posh office.]</p><p>It’s the same problem that the very wealthy face—a gradual drifting upward, away from the regular problems of regular humans. Unless you stay grounded—take public transit, buy your own food, walk the streets, set up your own IT systems, understand the value of a dollar and how far it can take you in New York or Wisconsin or Indonesia*—you start to forget the daily pains of the people you’re supposed to be creating painkillers for. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 4.1: How to Spot a Great Idea: The best ideas are painkillers, not vitamins.]</p><p>It’s not just the customer that starts to go out of focus. As the number of perks increase, people’s reason for being at their job can begin to blur as well. I’ve seen people who loved their jobs, found meaning and joy in making something, who worked hard but never felt like they were throwing away their time—until they fell headfirst into Google or Facebook or another corporate behemoth and completely lost their way. The more free stuff they saw other people get, the more they wanted. But getting those perks was only briefly satisfying—they lost their value over time. So they kept trying to get more and more. That became their focus. And making stuff, caring deeply about the work they were doing, creating something meaningful, really liking their job—it got lost by the wayside.</p><p>And it all started with the fucking massages.</p><p>To be clear, I fully support massages. I love massages. I get them all the time. Everyone should get massages. But at no point should your company culture be formed around the idea that massages are your due. At no point should you promise employees that they’ll get massages forever. At no point should perks define your business or drag it down.</p><p>Perks are frosting. High-fructose corn syrup. And nobody will begrudge you a little sugar—everyone likes sweets from time to time. But stuffing your face full of them from morning to night isn’t exactly a recipe for happiness. Just as dessert shouldn’t come before dinner, perks shouldn’t come before the mission you’re there to achieve. The mission should fill and fuel your company. The perks should be a sprinkle of sugar on top.</p><p>Chapter 6.5
Unbecoming CEO
A CEO is not a king or queen. It’s not a lifetime appointment. At some point, you have to step down. Here’s how you’ll know it’s time:</p><ol><li><p>The company or market has changed too much: Some startup founders are not meant to be CEOs of larger companies. Some CEOs have the skills to manage one set of challenges and not another. If everything has changed so much that you have no idea how to manage it and the solutions you need to implement are completely out of your wheelhouse, it’s probably time to go.</p></li><li><p>You’ve turned into a babysitter CEO: You’ve settled into maintenance mode rather than continually challenging and growing your company.</p></li><li><p>You’re being pushed to become a babysitter CEO: Your board is demanding you stop taking big risks and just keep the trains running.</p></li><li><p>You have a clear succession plan and the company’s on an upswing: If things are going great and you think one or two execs on the team are ready to move up, then it may be time to make some room for them. Always try to leave on a positive note and leave the company in good hands.</p></li><li><p>You hate it: This job is not for everyone. If you can’t stand it, that doesn’t mean you’ve failed. It just means you’ve discovered something useful about yourself and can now use that discovery to find a job you love.</p></li></ol><hr><p>We had to call a CEO’s mom once.</p><p>My investment firm Future Shape had invested in his company—they had an incredible vision, a ton of potential—but the CEO was a first-time founder, completely unprepared for the job. He’d hear our feedback, fall on his sword, say it’ll never happen again, and then of course it would. He never really listened and never really learned. After we had tried to coach him personally and professionally for more than eighteen months, things were only getting worse—he was demeaning staff in meetings, arguing in the hallways, even arguing with customers. Enough was enough. So the board fired the CEO.</p><p>But the CEO wouldn’t leave.</p><p>We tried carrots. We tried sticks. He wouldn’t budge, wouldn’t listen to reason. Then he put a gun to our heads—he hired lawyers and began preparing to sue the board, the company, and his investors.</p><p>So we called his mom—the only person we thought he might listen to. We told her what would happen if we got sued: the board would fiercely countersue, the CEO’s lies to investors would become public, and he’d probably never get funding for another startup again. He might not even get another job.</p><p>After almost a year of knock-down, drag-out fighting, that’s what finally made him surrender. His mom.</p><p>But it was so bitter that we had to lock him out of the building and make sure he had zero further affiliation with the company. It was the only way to save an incredible team with a ton of potential to fulfill their mission.</p><p>At a different company, the same conversation took two minutes. We told the CEO that he shouldn’t be CEO anymore. He sighed, then smiled. “Thank you,” he said. “What a relief!”</p><p>Because a handful of founder CEOs have become famous and mind-bogglingly rich, there’s this myth that the transition between starting a company and running it through all its phases, good and bad, is natural. Inevitable. If you create a startup, of course you’re going to stick with it as it blossoms into a real company, then a corporation. Isn’t that the whole point?</p><p>But a startup with five smart friends is a completely different beast than a company of 100, never mind 1,000. The job and responsibilities of an early founder and later-stage CEO are polar opposites.</p><p>Not every founder is cut out to be a CEO at every stage of a company.</p><p>Sometimes they don’t know how a medium-sized company works, let alone a big one. They might not have the right mentors around them, might not know how to build a team or attract customers. And when all that falls on their heads, they typically revert to what they were good at when they were an individual contributor and abandon the real responsibilities of CEO, ignore the board’s warnings, flounder, and implode. It’s a hard but valuable lesson and many entrepreneurs learn from it and try again, usually with more success. I was one of them.</p><p>But that kind of experience is avoidable. You can notice when you’re in a nosedive, you can look around, feel the wind in your hair. And you can do something about it—admit what’s happening and step down.</p><p>But most CEOs who are on the brink of failure just shut their eyes and wait for the crash. There’s often so much of their ego wrapped up in being a CEO, so much time and work. People spend their entire lives striving to lead a company. They make it the center of their self-worth and their identity. The prospect of letting go of that—just walking away—can be terrifying.</p><p>That’s true when you’re a first-time founder or when you’ve been leading companies for decades. Ego is a hell of a drug.</p><p>That’s why some CEOs—even founders—just turn into barnacles. I can’t tell you how many longtime CEOs I’ve seen clinging to the job even when their passion for it was gone. When they’ve slowly morphed from a parent CEO into a babysitter whose only interest is to protect what they’ve built, to maintain their position and the status quo. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 6.1: Becoming CEO.]</p><p>These CEOs fool themselves into thinking it’s okay that they don’t feel the same intensity anymore, that they worked hard in the beginning and now they get to sit back and enjoy the spoils.</p><p>But that’s not how it works.</p><p>It’s your job as a CEO to constantly push your company forward—to come up with new ideas and projects to keep it fresh and alive. Then it’s your job to work hard on those new projects, to be as passionate about them as you were about the original problem you came there to solve. In the meantime, other people on your team focus on your core business, optimizing the pieces that are already set up.</p><p>If you can’t get excited about that, if you can’t come up with new ideas or embrace the daring ones that your team dreams up, then that’s a pretty good sign: you’ve become a babysitter. It’s time to go.</p><p>There’s no challenge to being a babysitter CEO. No joy. And worse—it’s bad for the team. Bad for the company.</p><p>That fact isn’t always obvious to everyone, though. Sometimes the board forces CEOs to act more like COOs. Just keep everything steady, they say. Everything is working, why take the risk? Don’t spook the shareholders. We know best. Just follow orders.</p><p>That’s what I faced at Google. And that’s why I left.</p><p>Not just because Google was trying to sell Nest or because they wanted me to stop acting like a parent CEO, but as a warning to my team. I was under a gag order, so I couldn’t tell everyone that something was seriously wrong. But I could show them.</p><p>They say “A captain should go down with the ship.” I say bullshit. If the ship is obviously sinking, then the passengers will probably notice—at that point it’s the job of the captain to stay aboard until everyone’s safely in the lifeboats. However, if you’re a CEO or high-level executive and you can see the water level rising before everyone else, then it’s your responsibility to signal clear and present danger to your team. And there’s no clearer sign that something ain’t right than you walking out the door.</p><p>Sometimes the only warning flag you can wave is your resignation letter.</p><p>And sometimes it’s even bigger than that. Bigger than you. Bigger than your team or your company. Sometimes the entire market changes; sometimes the priorities of the planet evolve. These are the moments when the company a CEO was running before doesn’t make sense in the world anymore. Oil and gas CEOs are looking down the barrel of this moment right now. So are automakers. It’s time for a new model.</p><p>And we need new blood.</p><p>Smart CEOs see the change coming, sooner or later—either for them personally or for the company or for the world. And they create a succession plan.</p><p>You never know when the rug will be pulled out from under you. Maybe your entire industry will change or you’ll be bored by your job or you’ll get hit by a bus. That’s why you make a will. It’s also why you hire other executives and possibly a COO who you’d be comfortable handing the company to eventually.</p><p>Even in an emergency, you want the transition to a new CEO to be as fluid and confident as possible.</p><p>But it shouldn’t take an emergency to push you out. You shouldn’t take your success as an invitation to stay forever. Don’t look around and see the incredible team you’ve built and the company you’ve grown and think, Yes. This is it. This is success. I’m not moving from here.</p><p>That’s not how it works, either.</p><p>That incredible team you’ve built needs room to rise, and you’re currently sitting in the top spot. If they don’t see any potential for moving up in their career, they’ll start to leave and find different opportunities.</p><p>And the good times won’t last forever. Upswings will inevitably turn into downswings. And you want to leave when things are going well, when you can hand the company over proudly to the next CEO, not throw it to them in a panic as you get cut loose by the board.</p><p>As we’re writing this, Zhang Yiming, the founder and CEO of ByteDance, the creators of TikTok, announced that he’s resigning. TikTok has never been more popular. Zhang is experiencing a high that few CEOs ever reach. But he can see a change coming. And in this case, it’s internal. He just doesn’t want the job. It doesn’t suit him. “The truth is, I lack some of the skills that make an ideal manager,” he said. “I’m more interested in analyzing organizational and market principles.”</p><p>That’s the kind of self-awareness and reasonableness that makes for a great leader. He seems to be making the right move, motivated by his gut, not his ego.</p><p>And now he has options. He can quit completely and maybe start a new company. He can move up and join the board and still have plenty of influence over how the company develops.</p><p>Or he can stay at the company and just take a different position. Part of the founder CEO myth is that once you’re a CEO, there’s no going back—that nobody wants to leave the job once they’ve got it. But people can bounce back and forth.</p><p>However, if a founder steps down from the CEO job but stays with the company, things can get messy.</p><p>If the founder isn’t very careful, they can create all kinds of problems for the new CEO and the executives they leave behind. The same goes for cofounders—they have to be aware of the conflicts they can create in the company just by voicing an opinion. Founders have to watch how they’re perceived, what meetings they go to, what language they use, what suggestions they make, and how clear it is that they are suggestions, not directives. They have to be extremely clear on their roles. Otherwise they can unknowingly—or intentionally—create factions in the company, some following the founder, some following the CEO, everyone getting upset, confused, pissed off.</p><p>I watched it happen at one company—the founder stepped down, helped to choose a successor. But then the founder stuck around, roaming the halls and giving everyone random bursts of feedback. Nobody was quite sure if it was proscriptive or just a suggestion, if they should jump to it or just take it as friendly advice. “The CEO can always be replaced, but not the founder. So I guess I should listen to the founder?”</p><p>The CEO was frustrated, the team utterly confused. So they settled on a new plan—the CEO would run things and the founder would step back, only communicating through the CEO. It worked well, everyone breathed a sigh of relief, things started looking up.</p><p>That lasted two weeks.</p><p>Then the founder walked into the team meeting again. Everyone’s faces just dropped. “No, no not again!” They were completely deflated. For fourteen glorious days they’d known what they were doing, knew who to talk to, knew what the plan was. But the future was completely up in the air yet again. People started quitting. No one had the power to tell the founder, “Get out and stay out. We love you and your ideas, but you’re making everything worse.”</p><p>Founders need to be aware that they can easily undermine the work of the CEO and core team. Even if a founder chooses to only be a member of the board, they still have to be careful—they’re not leading the team anymore. They become a coach, a mentor, an advisor. Just one voice out of many.</p><p>That’s always hard. But it’s much worse when you have to cut all ties. When your baby gets thrown to the wolves and the only thing you can do is walk away. That is agonizing.</p><p>When I was leaving Nest, I called an all-hands meeting of everyone in the company. And all these incredible people, hundreds of passionate, brilliant people who had built this company with me—from nothing, from a sketch, from a leaky garage with a squirrel problem—sat watching me in anticipation. I looked at them, I teared up. And I told them I was done.</p><p>Then I had to let Google do whatever they were going to do next.</p><p>That’s the real twist of the knife when you leave, especially if it’s contentious—the new regime usually chops your projects into pieces just to leave their mark and show that nothing of yours remains. They even take the pictures of the founders and early team off the walls. You have to know it’s coming and still walk away.</p><p>And then you have to mourn.</p><p>When you’re a founder, leaving your company can feel like a death.</p><p>You pour so much of your time, your energy, yourself into this business and then all of a sudden it’s gone. A limb hacked off. A friend you’ve loved dearly and grown up with, gone forever.</p><p>Your new life seems bizarrely empty. Quiet. Your days and nights were utterly consumed before and now . . . nothing.</p><p>You’ll feel terrible. Awful. But don’t just immediately jump into a new job to distract yourself. And resist the urge to worry that your market value is declining every day you’re not working. This feeling is usually driven by self-doubt, not the reality of the job market. The world will not judge you for taking some time off. There is a real shortage of talent—especially smart, dedicated talent in the CEO chair—so if you want to go there again, don’t think you can’t.</p><p>But you have to go through the time and mental exercises necessary to process the experience, recover, and then learn from it.</p><p>There’s a half-life to everything.</p><p>In my experience it takes most people about a year and a half before they can start thinking about something new. There’s a reason people in some cultures wear black for twelve months after a death. That’s how long it takes to come to terms with this kind of loss.</p><p>The first three to six months will creep by as you get over the initial shock, the denial and possibly anger, the gnashing of teeth and tearing of hair when you see what they’re doing to your baby. It will also take you that long to get through the list of crap you’ve been meaning to do but had been ignoring because of work. Only after you exhaust that list can you stop getting distracted by the past and start getting bored. This is a necessary step. You absolutely need to get bored before you can find new things to be inspired by.</p><p>It will take another six months to start reengaging with the world. To stop caring quite as much about what went wrong. To start learning new things, finding your curiosity again.</p><p>Then for the next six months you can begin to look at your life with fresh eyes. Get distracted. Get excited. Start thinking about what’s next. And you don’t have to get right back on the same racetrack that you jumped off the year before. Just because you were CEO once doesn’t mean you need to be CEO again. You can always find or create new opportunities for yourself. You can always learn and grow and change.</p><p>Take the time you need to become the person you want to be. Just like you did at the start of your career and at every fork in the road along the way.</p><p>Conclusion: Beyond Yourself
In the end, there are two things that matter: products and people.</p><p>What you build and who you build it with.</p><p>The things you make—the ideas you chase and the ideas that chase you—will ultimately define your career. And the people you chase them with may define your life.</p><p>It’s incredibly special to create something together with a team. From nothing, from chaos, from a spark in someone’s head, to a product, a business, a culture.</p><p>If everything aligns, if the timing is right, if you get incredibly lucky, you’ll fight to create a product you believe in, that has so much of you and your team bottled inside it, and it will sell. It will spread. It won’t just solve your customers’ pain points; it will give them superpowers. If you make something truly disruptive, truly impactful, it will take on a life of its own. It will create new economies, new ways of interacting, new ways of living.</p><p>Even if your product doesn’t change the whole world, even if it has a modest scope and a smaller audience, it can still change an industry. Do something different. Shift customer expectations. Set the standard higher. It can make a market, a whole ecosystem, better.</p><p>Your product, this thing you create together with your team, can eclipse your wildest expectations.</p><p>Or, then again, maybe it won’t.</p><p>Maybe it will fail.</p><p>Maybe you’ll have your own General Magic—an incredible vision, a beautiful idea, toppled by bad timing, immature technology, a fundamental misunderstanding of your customer.</p><p>Or maybe your product will thrive but your business will disintegrate. You’ll work and work to create your own company, pour your life into the never-ending grinder of people problems and org design and meeting after meeting after meeting. And then you’ll hand this gleaming jewel over to people who promise to love it and polish it and help it shine—and they’ll let it slip through their fingers, fall to the dirt.</p><p>That happens sometimes.</p><p>Success is not a guarantee. No matter how great your team. How good your intentions. How wonderful your product. Sometimes it will all fall apart.</p><p>But even if your product is dead or your company is dead, what you’ve made still matters. It still counts. You’ll walk away having created something you’re proud of. Having tried. Having learned and grown. You’ll still carry your idea and its as-yet-unfulfilled potential; you’ll still hold on to the opportunity, the chance to try again.</p><p>And you’ll hold on to the people.</p><p>Today I still work with friends I met at General Magic. At Philips. At Apple. At Nest.</p><p>The products have changed, the companies have changed, but the relationships haven’t.</p><p>And now my life is all about relationships. Now my product is people.</p><p>After Nest I started an investment firm—Future Shape. We call ourselves “mentors with money.” We invest our own cash into companies that we think will dramatically improve society, the environment, or human health. And then we give them what all VCs promise but rarely deliver—personal attention. Real help when they really need it, sometimes before they know they need it.</p><p>Although the people I mentor have taught me much more than I could possibly teach them. I’ve learned about so many different industries and businesses, about agriculture and aquaculture and material science, about mushroom leather and bikes and microplastics. With every team or founder I mentor, another world opens up.</p><p>This job is just as meaningful as anything I’ve ever made, any object I’ve manufactured. These are incredible people and incredible people are the heart of any and all innovation. They’re going to change the world. Fix the world. Helping them, investing in them, mentoring them is probably some of the most important work I’ve ever done.</p><p>When I look back, I realize it’s the most important work I’ve always done.</p><p>The best part of being an exec at Apple or a CEO at Nest was the opportunity to help people. That was always the most gratifying experience: I could help the team take care of their families. I could help someone if they got sick, or if their kids or parents got sick. And we built a community, a culture of quality and determination and innovation, where so many people flourished, where brilliant people could create and fail and learn and thrive together.</p><p>Often they came to Nest doing one thing, and left knowing that they could do a hundred.</p><p>All they needed was a push.</p><p>The thing holding most people back is themselves. They think they know what they can do and who they’re supposed to be, and they don’t explore beyond those boundaries.</p><p>That is, until someone comes along and pushes them—willingly or unwillingly, happily or unhappily—into doing something more. Into discovering a well of creativity or willpower or brilliance that they never realized they had.</p><p>It’s a lot like pushing past the first version of a product. You dedicate every minute, every brain cell to creating V1. Exhausted, you edge it over the finish line. But even though it took all you had to make it, V1 is never good enough. You can see its huge potential. You can see how much more it can be. So you don’t stop at the finish line—you keep pushing until you reach V2, V3, V4, V18. You keep uncovering more ways that this product can be great.</p><p>Humans are the same way. But so many of us get stuck at V1. Once we settle into ourselves, we lose sight of what we can become. But just as products are never finished, neither are humans. We’re constantly changing. Constantly evolving.</p><p>So you push. As a leader, a CEO, a mentor—you push even when people resent you for it. Even when you worry that maybe you’ve pushed too far . . .</p><p>But there’s always a reward on the other side.</p><p>It’s worth it to do things well. It’s worth it to try for greatness. It’s worth it to help your team, to help people.</p><p>And one day you’ll get an email from someone you worked with—two, three, maybe ten years ago. And they’ll thank you. Thank you for pushing them. For helping them realize what they were capable of. They’ll say they hated you for it then, resented every minute, couldn’t believe how hard they had to work, how you made them start from scratch, how you wouldn’t let up.</p><p>But eventually they realized that moment had been a turning point, a jumping-off point. It changed the trajectory of their entire career. The things you built together changed their life.</p><p>And that’s how you’ll know you’ve done something meaningful.</p><p>You’ve made something worth making.</p><p>Acknowledgments
Writing this book was easier than I thought. And so, so much harder.</p><p>Harder than making the iPod. Or iPhone. Or Nest Learning Thermostat.</p><p>The easy part was figuring out what to write about. Almost every day an entrepreneur would ask me a question—about storytelling, about breakpoints, about growing a team or managing their board. We’d talk through their issue, I’d give them some advice, then I’d put it in the book.</p><p>So many of the topics were simple—it mostly felt like common sense. And I wondered if this book needed to exist. But then the next day, someone else would ask me the same question. A week later, it would happen again. And again and again. I’ve frankly been getting sick of hearing myself tell the same stories over and over, week after week, month after month.</p><p>It became clear to me why I was doing this. Common sense is common, but it isn’t evenly distributed. You can’t take the obvious approach to building a team if you’ve never built a team. You can’t intuitively understand marketing if you’ve been an engineer all your life. If you’re doing something new, if you’re trying something for the first time, you have to earn your common sense. It’s hard-fought wisdom that you have to stumble into through trial and error, through trying and failing, or—if you’re lucky—through conversations with someone who’s done it before. Many times you just need someone to confirm your gut feeling and give you the confidence to follow it.</p><p>That’s why I wrote this book.</p><p>And it’s why Bill Campbell never did.</p><p>Bill was a better coach and mentor than I’ll ever be. People were always after him to write his advice down, but he always refused.</p><p>I think the reason was that being a mentor, a coach, comes down to trust—to a relationship between two people. To give good advice, Bill had to know you, your life, your family, your company, your fears and ambitions. He focused on helping one person in the moment they needed it most and tailored his advice to exactly what was going on in their lives.</p><p>But you can’t do that in a book.</p><p>It was the thing I struggled with most while writing—not knowing my audience, not knowing what each reader was going through. There’s so much to talk about—way, way too much. The first version of this book was seven hundred pages long. And even then, it all felt too surface level. I could never dig in as deep as I wanted. I could give general rules of thumb and tell stories about what worked for me, but they wouldn’t work for everyone. And sometimes they’d be completely wrong.</p><p>But I decided to write what I knew. I looked back over everything I did, everything I learned over the last thirty-plus years, and opened up the curtains—showed how the sausage gets made. It’s been hard, but also cathartic. It’s helped me process a lot of what’s happened over my career.</p><p>I’ve accepted that sometimes I’ll be wrong. And sometimes I’ll piss people off. But if you’re not pissing someone off, then you’re not doing anything worth doing. If you’re not making mistakes, you’re not learning.</p><p>Do, fail, learn.</p><p>And hopefully over the ten years that I’ve thought about writing this book, I failed enough and learned enough to figure out what was worth saying.</p><p>And who was worth thanking.</p><p>First, a sincere (I mean it) thank-you to all the assholes, bad bosses, terrible teammates, crappy company cultures, awful CEOs, incompetent board members, and incessant schoolyard bullies. I would have never realized what I didn’t want to be without you. No matter how painful those lessons were, truly—thank you.</p><p>You helped motivate me to become someone who could do better. Who could write this book. And writing it wouldn’t have been possible without the incredible efforts and trust of:</p><p>My wife and kids—thank you for always being there, being my inspiration, my support, and my mentors (and suffering through all the loud calls).</p><p>My cowriter in crime, Dina Lovinsky—it was a roller coaster of positive and not-so-positive emotions and life events to pull this together. But if it ain’t scary it ain’t fun, right?</p><p>My tireless team who helped on the book—Alfredo Botty, Lauren Elliot, Mark Fortier, Elise Houren, Joe Karczewski, Jason Kelley, Vicky Lu, Jonathon Lyons, Anton Oenning, Mike Quillinan, Anna Sorkina, Bridget Vinton, Matteo Vianello, Henry Vines and the Penguin team—who have had to suffer through all kinds of endless, inane requests and questions.</p><p>My editor, Hollis Heimbouch, and her HarperCollins team—for putting up with the crazy first-time authors and countless missed deadlines while we tried to achieve some sort of (naive) perfection.</p><p>My agent—Max Brockman and the Brockman team and especially John Brockman (for hounding me for over a decade to write any book).</p><p>All the encouragement, support, and great ideas from friends and readers—Cameron Adams, David Adjay, Cristiano Amon, Frederic Arnault, Hugo Barra, Juliet de Baubigny, Yves Behar, Scott Belsky, Tracy Beiers, Kate Brinks, Willson Cuaca, Marcelo Claure, Ben Clymer, Tony Conrad, Scott Cook, Daniel Ek, Jack Forester, Case Fadell, Pascal Gauthier, Malcolm Gladwell, Adam Grant, Hermann Hauser, Thomas Heatherwick, Joanna Hoffman, Ben Horowitz, Phil Hutcheon, Walter Isaacson, Andre Kabel, Susan Kare (designer of the famous walking lemon, among a million other things), Scott Keogh, Randy Komisar, Swamy Kotagiri, Toby Kraus, Hanneke Krekels, Jean de La Rochebrochard, Jim Lanzone, Sophie Le Guen, Jenny Lee, John Levy, Noam Lovinsky, Chip Lutton, Micky Malka, John Markoff, Alexandre Mars, Mary Meeker, Xavier Niel, Ben Parker, Carl Pei, Ian Rogers, Ivy Ross, Steve Sarracino, Naren Shaam, Kunal Shah, Vineet Shahani, Simon Sinek, David and Alaina Sloo, Whitney Steele, Lisette Swart, Anthony Tan, Min-Liang Tan, Sebastian Thrun, Mariel van Tatenhove, Steve Vassallo, Maxime Veron, Gabe Whaley, Niklas Zennström, Andrew Zuckerman—your frank comments and advice helped so much to shape this book and give us the confidence to continue through the tough weeks.</p><p>The teams at General Magic, Apple iPod and iPhone, Nest, and our Future Shape family of entrepreneurs—without you this book could have never happened. I’ve learned so much from you and you truly helped keep me honest.</p><p>The friends and teammates we’ve lost along the way—Sioux Atkinson, Zarko Draganic, Phil Goldman, Allen “Skip” Haughay, Blake Krikorian, Leland Lew. Steve. Bill. I often think of you and wish we’d had more time.</p><p>And you, our readers. Thank you for your confidence in me and for buying this book. Not just because I worked hard on it, but because it’s supporting something bigger. We printed this book using green practices so we’d have a minimal impact on the world, but we’re using the proceeds from it to have a much larger one. Everything I make from this book will be invested into a Climate Fund managed by my investment and advisory firm, Future Shape.</p><p>Go to tonyfadell.com to learn more.</p><p>And thanks again. I hope this book helped you in some small way.</p><p>Onward,</p><p>Tony</p><p>PS: I’m not sure if I’m going to ever go through this again and write another book, but if you think I should dig deeper, or offer different advice, or write about something completely new, I’m listening.

This book is as green as we could make it. It’s important—to me, to the planet, to the next generation of humanity—that we move beyond the status quo. Ten percent recycled paper isn’t going to cut it.</p><p>My goal was a fully compostable book made with 100 percent post-consumer recycled materials, no harmful chemicals, and materials and printing processes that had zero carbon footprint and used minimal natural resources. Unfortunately we couldn’t even get close to my ambitions.</p><p>image
Our publishers worked with me to find the most innovative, cleanest processes and materials in the industry. But sufficiently green options often didn’t exist, or we couldn’t even find out what processes were used. Many parts of the bookmaking business are still opaque and need to be disrupted. This industry has a long way to go to become 100 percent green. Just like every other business in the world.</p><p>So if you have an idea or technology to innovate in fiber management, printing, binding, or recycling, I’m ready to hear about it. And fund it.
