Marrying for Money
Every time you raise capital, you should think of it as a marriage: a long-term commitment between two individuals based on trust, mutual respect, and shared goals. Even if you take money from an enormous venture capital (VC) firm, everything ultimately comes down to the relationship you form with a single partner at that firm and whether your expectations are aligned.</p><p>As in marriage, you can’t just throw yourself at anyone who shows a little interest. You have to take time to find someone you’re compatible with—who doesn’t play games or pressure you too much—and make sure it’s the right moment for you to settle down. You don’t want to get married when your company is so young that you don’t know who you really are or what you want to become, or just because all your friends are doing it, or because you’re scared that if you don’t make a commitment now you won’t be able to find another relationship.</p><p>You also have to understand your partner and their priorities. For example, a VC is beholden to the limited partners (LPs are large-scale investors or entities like banks or teachers’ unions or very wealthy families) who fund that VC—so they may push you to sell or go public before you’re ready in order to show value to the LPs. And a company with a VC arm, like Intel or Samsung, may use their investment in your company to wrangle a better business deal for themselves at your expense. Even if your funders have your best interests at heart—even if your mom is your angel investor—that doesn’t necessarily mean her money comes risk-free or with no strings attached.</p><hr><p>The reason venture capital exists is to facilitate transactions—you need money, they give you money. But the reason it works is relationships—the back-and-forth between you and a VC during the pitching process, the way a VC helps you recruit execs or run your board after the deal, the connections they offer for your next round. Venture capital is not fueled by money. It’s fueled by humans.</p><p>And the rules for every successful human relationship are the same: before you can jump headfirst into a major life-changing commitment, you need to get to know each other. Trust each other. Understand each other.</p><p>That means you have to be ready to be scrutinized, to be examined, and—most likely—to be found wanting. You might hear “no” a dozen times before you find “the one.” It’s like a particularly brutal form of dating—but instead of asking to buy them a drink, you’re begging them for money. It ain’t fun.</p><p>Another thing: you’ll never hear “it’s not you, it’s me.” It’s always you. It’s your company, your ideas, your personality that will be judged.</p><p>It’s hard to be exposed like that; it’s hard to open yourself up. And that’s true even if everything’s gone crazy—even if it seems like anyone with half a pitch deck is getting funded.</p><p>Like how it was in 1999. Or how it is right now in 2022.</p><p>The world of investment is cyclical. The funding environment is always shifting back and forth from a founder-friendly environment to an investor-friendly environment. It’s like the housing market—sometimes it’s good for sellers, sometimes for buyers. In a founder-friendly environment, there’s so much money flowing into the marketplace that investors will fund just about anything because they don’t want to miss out on any deals. In an investor-friendly market, there’s a lot less capital to go around, investors are pickier, and founders get worse terms.</p><p>And then sometimes there’s a crazy market when it feels like cash is raining from the sky, all the rules have been thrown out, and it’s never going to end.</p><p>But it will end. Just like it ended in 2000. There’s always a reversion to the mean. And even when it’s crazy, it still won’t be easy. You’ll still have to work for it. Details will still matter. Even if it looks easy, it never is. There are just varying degrees of difficulty—from damn hard to nearly impossible.</p><p>So before you start this process, you first have to know yourself and be sure of what you’re asking for. Because you won’t get a second chance at your first round. You have to be serious. You have to prepare. And you have to know what you’re getting into.</p><p>The first question you should ask yourself is the most basic one: does your business actually need outside money right now? For many early pre-seed-stage startups, the answer is “no” surprisingly often. If you’re still researching, still testing things out, making sure your idea has legs, then you don’t need to immediately leap to financing. Take your time. Get comfortable with delayed intuition.</p><p>If you do think you’re ready to take money, then what exactly do you plan to use that money for? Do you need to build a prototype? Recruit a team? Research an idea? Get a patent? Petition local government? Fuel a partnership? Create a marketing campaign? What’s the minimum amount necessary to meet your needs now, and how much will you require later as those needs change?</p><p>Once you understand that, you can think through whether you have a business that investors will want to invest in. It’s not a given that your company is right for venture capital. Most big VCs are surprisingly risk averse—they won’t invest in startups that can’t prove they’re already on a clear growth trajectory. VCs have been trained by the internet age to expect numbers before they invest: growth rates, sign-up rates, click-through rates, unsubscribe rates, run rates, all the rates. And VCs have bosses to report to—their LPs, the people and organizations who give them money. They need to show that they’re making wise, highly profitable investments with the right management teams.</p><p>If they do invest, many large VCs will assume you need a huge infusion of cash right away so you can quickly show a big return. Those expectations and that timeline don’t make sense for many startups.</p><p>So don’t assume you have to immediately start chasing brand names. You have a lot of options—giant VCs who invest in hundreds of companies and give out tens and hundreds of millions of dollars; smaller niche or regional VCs who invest in a handful of businesses; angel investors who can make a small contribution to get you started and ready for bigger VCs later; and companies with investing arms that are looking to use your product or wrangle a business deal. All these options exist all over the United States and all over the world, not just Silicon Valley. There’s money everywhere now.</p><p>But regardless of what source of capital you choose, everything ultimately comes down to the individuals you’ll work with. Even if you get a meeting with the biggest firm in Palo Alto, you won’t be meeting with the whole firm. You have to impress and form a relationship with one person in that room: the partner. That’s who will decide the terms of your agreement, who will be on your board. That’s the person you’re marrying.</p><p>I once worked with an entrepreneur who was pitching a huge brand-name VC. After a great meeting, the VC said they were in—they’d send over a term sheet right away. A week went by, then another. Then the managing partner started playing games, trying to reduce the valuation. He’d ignore the entrepreneur for a week, then come roaring back with more questions. And it just kept going—for four, five, six weeks.</p><p>In the meantime, the entrepreneur started talking to other VCs. And one of those firms sent over a term sheet the next day.</p><p>The entrepreneur had to make a tough call. Wait for the biggest player to get around to you or go with a lesser-known but much more enthusiastic investor? Who would be a better partner? Who would be more helpful in the long term?</p><p>So the entrepreneur called the big-name VC and broke the news: they’d signed with another firm. The partner was livid—started screaming the kind of stuff you hear from villains in eighties movies. “What the fuck! You don’t do that to me!” He slammed the phone down and was never heard from again. And I mean that literally—this partner still won’t talk to the entrepreneur. Pretends they don’t exist. Avoids them at parties.</p><p>But being on the partner’s shit list was much better than taking his money and having that asshole standing on their startup’s neck. The entrepreneur had dodged a bullet. All the stalling had been a tactic to rock the entrepreneur’s confidence, grind them into accepting worse terms. And when that stupid game backfired, one of the most well-known names in the Valley turned into a bitter child. Not someone you want to get into bed with, never mind marry.</p><p>Remember, once you take money from an investor, you’re stuck with them. And the balance of power shifts. A VC can fire a founder, but a founder can’t fire their VC. You can’t divorce them for irreconcilable differences.</p><p>And if things go south, you can end up in an estranged marriage—still legally tied together, but never speaking. When a VC writes off your company, they basically ignore you. Won’t help you. Won’t connect you to other VCs. Won’t speak up for you to partners. They’ll stand on the sidelines as your company goes bankrupt.</p><p>So you should always pay very close attention to how a VC treats you when they should be on their best behavior—when you’re getting along in the process and it seems like you might come to an agreement. If they start screwing around with you then, it should always ring alarm bells in your head. Here are a few other warning signs:</p><p>VCs who promise everything under the sun to get you to sign, then don’t deliver. Often they’ll repeat themselves over and over, telling you just how much personalized attention you’ll get, how much help, how much this or that. Make sure to talk to other startups who’ve worked with them to find out what they actually offer when they’re not in sales-pitch mode.
VCs who force the timing—who give you a term sheet to sign right here, right now—to make you feel panicked. A VC once gave me a term sheet as I was walking out of the meeting and pushed me to sign it on the spot. I asked if this was a used car dealership and told him I’d only sign after I read the terms.
Greedy VCs who will invest only if they can take an outsized piece of your company. Typically a VC needs between 18 and 22 percent to make their model work—step carefully if they begin asking for more. And don’t assume they’re the only game in town—if your gut is telling you to keep looking, then keep looking.
Some VCs court very inexperienced startups with the intention of pushing them around and telling them what to do rather than allowing the founder and CEO to run the company. Mentorship and advice is one thing; orders that must be obeyed are another.
Sometimes a potential investor sees something interesting in your company—maybe you haven’t received money from the right VCs, or you’re tight on cash, or you have an incredible breakout success. So they’ll propose a really sweet deal, but their terms will screw the other investors who have gotten you this far. We see lots of big and small VCs trying to gain an edge by not playing fair—they may overdilute previous investors or put terms in your deal that scare off new ones. And if things aren’t going well a couple of years down the road, they’ll have no qualms about screwing you, too. So be careful when the terms aren’t standard or seem too good to be true—sometimes it may appear that you’re only giving away a small thing, but if it doesn’t feel right in your gut, it may be that they’re trying to get a foot in the door to start turning the tables against everyone else. They want to control your company sooner or later.
One thing that many founders worry about but which isn’t usually a warning sign is if a VC has fired CEOs or founders in the past. Do your research—look at their track record. There are some well-known firms who are so focused on the company that they cut off founders’ heads without giving them a second chance, but most VCs are generally hesitant to remove founders. Sometimes too hesitant. And those who do so infrequently will have a very good reason.</p><p>In any case, it’s hard to generalize across an entire firm. It usually comes down to individuals. Just like everything else.</p><p>So when you reach out to pitch an investor, make sure you’re reaching out to the right person. Talk to founders who have worked with the VC in the past—who’ve gone through tough times together—and find out which partner is operational and helpful and smart and which only cares about the money.</p><p>Try to get a warm introduction—either through another founder or your mentor or a friend of a friend. Even if it’s a tenuous connection, it’s better than nothing. The hardest way to get a meeting with a VC is by cold-calling them. And before you make the call, try to drum up a little press, get some good PR, so when the VC looks you up there’s something to see.</p><p>Always remember that investors are swimming in pitches. Especially the big VCs, but also the smaller ones. You need some way to rise to the top and get their attention.</p><p>The best way to do that is with a compelling story. And knowing your audience. Even in Silicon Valley, most VCs won’t be technical. So don’t focus on the technology, focus on the “why.” <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 3.2: Why Storytelling.]</p><p>It won’t be easy to fit everything you want to say into fifteen slides—to make it flow in one smooth narrative, to make it compelling emotionally and rationally, to keep it high-level enough so that people can easily grasp the important points but not so high-level that it seems like you haven’t dug into the details. It’s an art.</p><p>As with all art, it takes practice. You’ll probably suck at it at first. Pitching is hard. You’ll need to constantly tune the deck up, change it around, tweak and revise.</p><p>So you don’t want your first pitch to be in front of the very top VC in your area. VCs talk to each other, so if one casts you aside, the others in that class may pass as well. If you can, pitch a “friendly” VC first—one that will give you feedback and help you improve and then, hopefully, welcome you back a second time.</p><p>Remember that you don’t have to come in perfectly polished for that first meeting. You can say, “I’d like to give you an early look at this. Maybe it would be of interest to you. I’d love to get your comments on it.” Listen to their feedback and learn from it. You don’t have to take every word of advice or criticism, but you should understand the reasons behind it and adjust accordingly.</p><p>Once you understand the pieces on the board, you can better plan your move. You can tailor the story to the individuals you’ll meet. You’ll start to feel ready.</p><p>Just don’t forget the other factor that can sneak up and kick your ass: time.</p><p>It will take longer than you think to get funding. Expect it to be a 3–5 month process. It may end up being faster than that—especially in a founder-friendly environment—but I wouldn’t gamble on it. Too many companies wait until they’re about to run out of money, then hit an air gap and are near bankruptcy before desperately grabbing whatever funding they can get. Always start the pitching process when you don’t actually need money. You want to be in a position of strength, not buckling under the pressure and making bad choices. You should also remember to watch out for the holidays—August, Chinese New Year, Thanksgiving through New Year. People forget that VCs take vacations, too.</p><p>Here are a few more tips to keep in mind as you’re going through the process:</p><p>Don’t play games. Just as you don’t want an investor who plays games with you, they will lose interest in you if you’re not up front and honest with them.
Listen to people’s feedback on your pitch and your plan, change it when it makes sense, but hold on to your vision and your “why” and don’t rearrange yourself based on the whims of every investor you talk to.
Be clear with investors on how much money you need and exactly how you’re going to spend it. Your job will be to create value for investors and ensure you’re hitting major milestones to raise the valuation of the business. That way the next time you raise money you won’t dilute existing investors, employees, or yourself.
Entrepreneurs think their valuation should always increase, even when they don’t hit the milestones they set out for themselves. But investors are running a business—if you don’t deliver, you don’t get a valuation increase and your own stock position dwindles. You may also need to dilute more because you’ll need to give extra stock to employees to retain them through the hard times.
Don’t assume you’ll get a valuation like other companies around you. Every investment stands on its own.
Investors don’t like to see when founders or executives are “fully vested”—they want to make sure you have skin in the game. You may have to “re-vest” some of the shares you have already to demonstrate your commitment to new investors.
Remember that investors are going to want references—they’ll want to talk to your customers as part of their due-diligence process. So have a data room with a collection of files that will make it easy for them.
In subsequent meetings, be up front with your risks and ways to mitigate them, who you need to hire, and the major challenges ahead.
Try to get two similarly influential investors to balance each other out. All VCs know each other, all VCs talk—and nobody wants to piss off their potential partners. So if one of your investors starts playing games, the other can tell them to cut the crap. Your business may not matter all that much to them in the long run, but typically nobody wants to ruin their reputation among other VCs and especially the LP community.
Finally, remember that even if you have an incredible meeting—everyone loves the pitch, you love the investors, the room is practically vibrating with good energy—even then the people you met with will have to go back and convince the investment committee to give you money.</p><p>For every VC that process is different, so keep asking the question: What’s the next step to get us to a yes? What’s the next step? What’s the next step?</p><p>It’s like playing chess. You always have to think two moves—and two investment rounds—ahead.</p><p>Even if you’re not interested in VCs yet. Even if you’re just looking for an angel.</p><p>The best thing about angel investors is that they aren’t beholden to LPs. They simply believe in you. They want to help you. And there’s nobody looming over their head demanding an immediate profit.</p><p>Angel investors are typically much more willing to take a risk, so they may fund you earlier than a VC would and give you much more leeway and time to figure out your company without pushing nearly as hard.</p><p>This can be great. Or the lack of constraints can be a hammer to your knees. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 3.5: Heartbeats and Handcuffs.]<!-- --> Or the guilt can take a hammer to your heart.</p><p>When I was twenty years old, I borrowed money from my uncle to start ASIC Enterprises, my startup that created processors for the Apple ]<!-- -->[. But then Apple stopped making Apple ]<!-- -->s and ASIC disintegrated, along with my uncle’s money. I felt awful—truly terrible—for years. But my uncle was very up front with me. He told me he knew he was making a bet, a bet on me, and that he was likely to lose it.</p><p>Fifty percent of marriages fail, but 80 percent of startups do.</p><p>If you start a company, the odds are against you. So you’ll need to get over the mental anguish of failure and losing other people’s money. If and when the time comes, you’ll have to be honest and open about it; you’ll have to admit what went wrong and how you learned from it.</p><p>But there’s nothing you can say that will make it easier. A VC’s money is one thing; your mom’s is another. If you take money from family and friends, you’ll have to work just as hard, if not harder, than you would if you took cash from a VC. And you’ll have to reckon with the chance that you’ll have to walk back to them empty-handed.</p><p>Even as I was starting Nest, I didn’t want that burden. I refused to take money from Xavier Niel, a good friend and incredible entrepreneur who founded Free, a French internet service provider. I wasn’t a twenty-year-old kid anymore and Xavier was in a very different spot financially than my uncle. But I didn’t want Xavier to think I was after his money. And I remembered that feeling of failure, of telling someone I cared about that their money was gone. So Xavier kept asking, and I kept saying no.</p><p>Finally we were onstage together just after Nest launched—in front of ten thousand people—and he turned to them and said, “He won’t let me invest!” At that point Nest was doing well and wasn’t nearly as risky, so I agreed to finally take his money. It turned out great in the end, but I didn’t want anything to poison our relationship in the beginning. Nest was stressful enough.</p><p>No matter which route you take—VC or angel or strategic or bootstrap—starting a company is hard. Getting money is hard. There are no shortcuts, no easy path, no room for dumb luck.</p><p>But if you do it right, if you choose the right people, then you’ll genuinely like your investors and they’ll help you through the tough times that always come with a startup. They’ll be there in sickness and in health and you’ll end up in a happy marriage. Maybe even a few of them.</p><p>After that, all that’s left to do is build a business.</p><p>Chapter 4.4
You Can Only Have One Customer
Regardless of whether your company is business-to-business (B2B) or business-to-consumer (B2C) or business-to-business-to-consumer (B2B2C) or consumer-to-business-to-consumer (C2B2C) or some-yet-unimagined acronym, you can only serve one master. You can only have one customer. The bulk of your focus and the whole of your branding should be for consumers or business—not both.</p><p>Understanding your customer—their demographics and psychographics, their wants and needs and pain points—is the foundation of your company. Your product, team, culture, sales, marketing, support, pricing—everything is shaped by that understanding.</p><p>For the vast majority of businesses, losing sight of the main customer you’re building for is the beginning of the end.</p><hr><p>Before the days of Linux servers, when Windows servers dominated the landscape, Apple decided to try B2B. To build their own servers. The project started just before I joined—Apple was desperately trying to crack the code on how to increase computer sales and bring in more developers. Corporate users needed to run all kinds of enterprise software from servers, so the quintessential consumer brand built a server for the enterprise.</p><p>It was a failure. It wasn’t that the technology was too difficult—that was actually the easiest part. B2B just wasn’t in Apple’s DNA. They didn’t have the marketing, sales, support, or developers. And corporate Chief Information Officers (CIOs) were accustomed to the countless enterprise-level services that Microsoft and Windows offered. Apple’s hardware was a tiny piece of the puzzle that these CIOs needed to make a purchase decision. The server team twisted themselves into knots trying to force an unnatural pairing—an Apple tree trying to grow an orange—until the iPod took off and saved the company and the server project was blessedly cancelled.</p><p>Steve Jobs was clear about the lesson he’d learned and made sure we all learned it, too: any company that tries to do both B2B and B2C will fail.</p><p>Is your customer Jim the Millennial, who saw your ad on Instagram then bought your product as a Christmas present for his sister? Or is it Jane the CIO of a Fortune 500 company who answered a cold email from your sales team, negotiated pricing and different product features for months, and now needs a team of customer success agents to train the five thousand employees under her? You cannot hold both those people in your head at the same time. You cannot make a single product for two completely opposite customers—for two different customer journeys.</p><p>Not when you’re making technology. Or services. Or a store. Not even if you’re making dinner.</p><p>It’s a hard rule.</p><p>But for every rule there are exceptions. Just because you start off as B2C doesn’t mean you can never work with the enterprise in any way. And a small number of very specific companies can split themselves down the middle and do just fine: travel businesses like hotels and airlines, retailers like Costco and Home Depot (their big innovation was taking a B2B product and opening it up to B2C). Financial products and banks can be both B2B and B2C, since some households run like a small business.</p><p>But even these companies have a fully B2C brand. That’s the other rule: if you cater to both, your marketing still has to be B2C. You can never convince a regular person to use a B2B product that’s obviously not meant for them, but you can convince a company to use your product if you appeal to the human beings inside that company.</p><p>That’s ultimately how, despite itself, Apple found itself firmly in the enterprise.</p><p>After the iPhone launched, CIOs were slow to clear it for business use. And while CEOs usually cede anything IT-related to the CIO, this time the CEOs rose up and demanded change. They loved their iPhones. So did their employees. And they wanted to use them at the office.</p><p>It was Apple’s success at creating something for consumers that led to their success in the enterprise. People fell in love with their phones and then wondered why the rest of their life wasn’t that easy. Nobody wanted to deal with garbage corporate tools that required days or weeks of training to use. They wanted an easily understandable interface, fast speeds, and slick hardware.</p><p>One of the main pulls to create the App Store was actually from corporations. As businesses began adopting the iPhone, they reached out to Apple, asking to make applications for their employees and sales. If Apple wanted people to continue using their phones for work, they’d have to give the enterprise the ability to create its own apps. And so the App Store was born.</p><p>Now Apple has separate teams to handle all of their B2B business, but the products are never defined to appease B2B customers. By keeping itself pure as a B2C company, Apple was able to tack on B2B without significantly altering its priorities or its marketing, or knocking its core business out of whack.</p><p>After Steve set the rules, Apple followed them. They know how the game is played.</p><p>But what happens when the game changes? What if it’s not just B2B and B2C anymore? What if there are new marketplaces, new services, new business models, new acronyms?</p><p>One of the companies I work with is DICE. It’s a next-generation music discovery and ticketing platform that’s B2B2C. And in its early years, DICE was torn in three directions by its three customers: music fans (consumer), music venues (business), and musicians/managers (business). On the one hand, DICE made most of its money from venues, so maybe its tools should cater to them. On the other hand, it wanted to create a great experience for fans. On the other hand—none of this would be possible without the artists, so maybe they should be the focus.</p><p>DICE needed to attract all three customers. It needed to keep all three happy to be successful. But DICE only had one team and one product. And every time it made concessions to the venues, the experience for the fans and artists suffered. When it tried to please the artists, the venues complained.</p><p>My advice was simple: Nothing has changed. The rules still apply. You gotta pick one. And the whole reason you started this company was to get rid of scalpers, to make an amazing experience for fans. You’re B2B2C, but don’t lose your mission as you navigate your acronym. The Bs matter, but without the C you have nothing.</p><p>Now it’s their “Golden Rule”: Our Only Customer Is The Fan.</p><p>And they make sure the venues and artists believe it, too. They remind them, continually, that if DICE does right by the fans, everything else will follow. The artists, the venues, DICE—they all have one master in the end: the person buying the concert ticket. The human being who just wants to see a great show.</p><p>That’s the thing to remember about B2B2C—it doesn’t matter how many businesses are involved: ultimately it’s the end consumer who carries the business model on their back.</p><p>But companies forget. It happens most often when a company evolves from B2C into B2B2C. They usually start off with no business model, no way to make money, just a lot of customers using their product for free. But free is never really free. Eventually many of these companies realize their most lucrative option is to sell users’ data to big business. That means bolting on B2B sales so they can resell customer data hundreds or even thousands of times. That’s the story of Facebook and Twitter and Google and Instagram and many, many others.</p><p>But that story can end badly. When attention and focus shift away from the consumer and toward the businesses bringing in the real money, companies go down some very dark alleys.</p><p>And it’s always the consumers who suffer.</p><p>So do not lose your focus. Do not think you can serve two masters. No matter what you’re building, you can never forget who you’re building it for. You can only have one customer. Choose wisely.</p><p>Chapter 4.5
Killing Yourself for Work
There are two kinds of work/life balance:</p><ol><li><p>True work/life balance: A magical, quasi-mythical state where you have time for everything: work, family, hobbies, seeing friends, exercising, vacationing. Work is just one part of your life that doesn’t intrude on any other part. This kind of balance is impossible when you’re starting a company, leading a team that’s trying to create innovative products or services on a competitive timeline, or just experiencing crunch time at work.</p></li><li><p>Personal balance when you’re working: Knowing you’re going to be working or thinking about work most of the time and creating space to give your brain and body a break. To reach some level of personal balance, you need to design your schedule so you have time to eat well (hopefully with family and friends), exercise or meditate, sleep, and briefly think about something other than the current crisis at the office.</p></li></ol><p>To withstand a complete lack of true work/life balance requires a clear organizational strategy. You need to prioritize. It’s important to have everything you need to think about written down and have a plan for when and how you’ll bring it up with your team. Otherwise it will swirl around in your brain endlessly, killing any meager chance you have of relaxing your shoulders for a minute.</p><hr><p>Here’s my advice: do not vacation like Steve Jobs.</p><p>Steve would typically take two weeks off, twice a year. We’d always dread those vacations at Apple. The first forty-eight hours were quiet. After that it would be a storm of nonstop calls.</p><p>He wasn’t tied up in meetings, worrying about the day-to-day, so he was free. Free to dream about the future of Apple at all hours of the day and night. Free to call and get our thoughts on whatever crazy idea just occurred to him—what about video glasses to watch movies from the video iPod? Yes? No? He’d want us to give our perspective right then or find answers fast so he could refine his thinking.</p><p>He worked harder on vacation than he did in the office.</p><p>That kind of crazy, nonstop focus sounds like just another Apple legend. The kind of thing only a mad genius would do. But it’s not, really.</p><p>Steve took it to an extreme, but a lot of people can’t get work out of their heads. I can’t. I’d hazard to say that most people can’t, especially when there’s a lot on the line. It’s not just CEOs and executives—everybody has crunch times. There’s just too much to do and you know more is coming, so even when you’re not doing the work, you think about it.</p><p>And sometimes that’s okay. Really. Sometimes it’s your only option. But there’s a world of difference between racking your brain, ruminating all night about a work crisis, versus letting yourself think about work in an unstructured, creative way. The latter gives your brain the freedom to stop hammering away at the same problems with the same worn-down tools. Instead, you let your mind rummage around to find new ones.</p><p>Sometimes I thought that’s why Steve took vacations—not to relax, not to avoid Apple, but to give himself a nice long time to rummage as he spent time with his family. Instead of trying to find true balance or allowing anyone else to find it, Steve ran full tilt. He let Apple become all-consuming in a way that pushed everything else in his life, except his family, to the periphery.</p><p>Most people have experienced that kind of complete collapse of work/life balance in critical moments when the pressure’s really on. But it’s how Steve lived. And if you’re not Steve Jobs—if you have to think about work all the time but you don’t want to think about work all the time—then you need to have a system.</p><p>You have to find a way to stay sane—to manage the inevitable swirling morass of tasks and meetings and plans and questions and problems and progress and fears. And you have to architect your schedule so your body and brain don’t get burned out or bloated beyond recognition. I say this as someone who’s been there—I physically and mentally fell apart at General Magic. Humans cannot survive on stress and Diet Coke alone.</p><p>But General Magic was one thing—that was early in my career, when I got caught in the explosion but didn’t cause it. Apple was something else entirely. It’s hard to describe the pressure of my first few years there. Especially at the very beginning, when I was running my startup while doing Apple contract work, trying to maneuver that into a way to save my team at Fuse. The stress only got cranked up after I began working on the iPod full-time.</p><p>In the beginning, it was a side project at Apple. But in the months and years that followed, the iPod became as important as the Mac, sometimes more important. The company was holding its breath, waiting to see if we’d succeed. Not only did we need to build this completely new thing, but we needed to build it incredibly quickly, up to Steve Jobs’s exacting specifications, make it beautiful and delightful in a way that would remind everyone of what Apple could be, and then have it be a roaring commercial success.</p><p>After getting Steve’s green light, I walked into the building in April 2001 knowing that we were going to have to design and build the iPod by the next holiday season—seven months away. And not because Steve set a crazy deadline. I did. Steve figured it would take 12–16 months. Everyone did.</p><p>Nobody believed we’d be able to pull it together in time to get it to customers by Christmas. But I had just come off four years at Philips, where more than 90 percent of projects got cancelled and killed. If you didn’t make your mark fast enough or your project ran into issues or dragged on, Philips corporate would descend upon you, ready to “save the business” from your mistake or steal it out from under you. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 2.3: Assholes.]<!-- --> I didn’t know if it would be the same at Apple or not, but I couldn’t take the risk.</p><p>Just like I couldn’t risk Sony launching a music player that Christmas and eclipsing us or risk getting caught in internal Apple politics. We were a tiny little team sucking resources away from the core business, which was under huge financial pressure to succeed. Other groups did not like that. They did not like us. I could feel their eyes on us and their daggers out.</p><p>So we had to prove ourselves. We worked relentlessly. My job was building and leading the team to create the iPod from scratch, including building the team itself. I had to be close to the day-to-day design and engineering work but also manage the expectations of the executives but also work with sales and marketing to make sure not to repeat the mistakes of Philips but also go to Taiwan to check on manufacturing but also make sure my team was dealing with the stress but also debate with Steve and other execs daily but also occasionally attempt to sleep.</p><p>Keeping everything in my head was impossible. There was always a new crisis, a new worry that would pop up, supplanting whatever I was worrying about a second ago. There were just too many tiny moving parts, too many gears that needed to turn other gears that needed to turn other gears, a half-made clock constantly cuckooing in my ear.</p><p>I needed to calm down. I needed to find space. I needed to prioritize.</p><p>Everyone thought I was crazy—and many still do—but here’s what I did: I took several sheets of paper with me everywhere. They had all the top milestones in front of us for each of the disciplines—engineering, HR, finance, legal, marketing, facilities, etc.—and everything we needed to do to reach those milestones.</p><p>Every top-level question that I had was on those papers. So when I was in a meeting or talking to someone, I could quickly scan it. What are my top issues? What issues do our customers have? What’s the current roadblock for this person’s team? What are the next major milestones? What date commitments did our teams make?</p><p>And then there was the best part—the ideas. Whenever someone had a great idea that we had to table for the moment—an improvement to the product or the organization—I’d write it down. So right next to the list of that week’s to-dos and tasks, there was a working library of all the things we couldn’t wait to begin. I’d regularly read them to myself and see if they still applied. It kept me inspired and excited and focused on the future. And it was great for the team. They saw that I paid attention to their ideas and made sure we kept thinking about them.</p><p>The only way for me to capture all of it—good ideas, priorities, roadblocks, the dates that people promised to deliver, and the major internal and external heartbeats ahead—was to take notes in every meeting. Longhand. Not on a computer. <!-- -->[See also: Figure 3.5.1, in Chapter 3.5.]</p><p>Writing by hand was important for me. I wasn’t staring at a screen, getting distracted by my email. A computer or a smartphone between you and the team is a huge barrier to focus and sends a clear message to everyone in the meeting: whatever I’m looking at on my screen is more important than you.</p><p>Even just taking notes on a computer was a nonstarter. Sometimes when I’m typing, I just . . . type. Whatever I’m writing down doesn’t make it all the way into my brain. But there was too much on the line for me to zone out, to not hear every word my team was saying.</p><p>The act of using a pen, then retyping and editing later, forced me to process information differently.</p><p>Every Sunday evening, I would go through my notes, reassess and reprioritize all my tasks, rifle through the good ideas, then update those papers on a computer and print out a new version for the week. Continually reprioritizing allowed me to zoom out and see what could be combined or eliminated. It let me spot moments when we were trying to do too much.</p><p>Those were the evenings when I’d realize why we were so overwhelmed—we had said “yes” to too many things and we needed to start saying “no.” And then came the hard work of figuring out what had to be delegated, what had to be delayed, and what had to be crossed off the list. I was forced to prioritize based on what really mattered, as opposed to what was just top of mind. That let me keep my eye on the bigger goals and milestones ahead of us, not just the fires at our feet or whatever feature we were most excited about that day.</p><p>Then Sunday night I’d email the whole list out to my management team. Each item had a name attached to it. Everyone could look at the top of the list to see what I’d be focused on that week, what they were accountable for, and what the next major milestones were.</p><p>And every Monday, we’d have a meeting about it.</p><p>Everyone hated it. I literally watched people flinch when I’d bring out the papers, scanning them for the thing I’d been asking about for weeks. That thing I’d refuse to forget about because it hadn’t gotten crossed off the list yet. On June 3 you said it would be ready by the end of the month. It’s now July—what’s the status of this project?</p><p>It wasn’t micromanagement. It was holding people accountable. It was holding everything in my head at the same time. It was holding on for dear life amid the flood of everything I needed to remember.</p><p>It started as a one-sheeter. Eventually it grew to eight pages, ten pages. It was labor intensive. Arcane. Never-ending. But it worked. And eventually my team grew to appreciate it. It kept me (relatively) calm. It helped me focus. And nobody ever had to wonder where my head was at. Everyone always knew what mattered to me—they had my priorities in writing, updated, every week.</p><p>A lot of them have picked up the practice themselves, and the people who worked for them have done the same. Everyone dreaded the list, the email, the meeting—until they too had too much in their brains. Until they needed a way to manage it.</p><p>I’m not saying this will work for everyone. Far from it. Everyone needs to find their own system. But you do need to prioritize your tasks, manage and organize your thoughts, and create a predictable schedule for your team to access those thoughts.</p><p>And then you need to take a break.</p><p>A real break. Take a walk or read a book or play with your kid or lift some weights or listen to music or just lie on the ground, staring at the ceiling. Whatever you need to do to stop your mind from frantically spinning in circles about work. Once you have a way to prioritize your tasks, you need to prioritize your physical and mental well-being. And I realize that’s easier said than done. Your startup or the project you’re leading is your baby. And babies roll down stairs, eat extension cords. They need constant attention.</p><p>That’s what work can feel like. Even if you take a vacation—and if you’re starting a major project you won’t go on vacation for a good long while—it’s like leaving your kid with a babysitter for the first time. You’re pretty sure they’ll be fine, but, you know, you’ll check just in case. And again in an hour. And maybe on the way home. Did you tell the sitter the baby sneezes when she’s sleepy? Better call again.</p><p>Eventually, you get to trust the babysitter. You’ll know your team can handle things without you. After a few generations of iPod were done, I took some real vacations.</p><p>I’d like to say I wasn’t like Steve Jobs—that I focused on my family and my personal joys and took time to relax. But I didn’t, really. I also spent all my time thinking about the future of the company—but in a different, less focused way than I did every day at the office. I rummaged.</p><p>I just didn’t call or email anyone about it. We talked only if there was a real emergency.</p><p>Every time I left, I’d hand the reins over to a different person who reported to me. It’s your problem now, buddy! It was a time for the team to step up and learn to do what I did. Vacations are a great way to build a team’s future capabilities and see who might step into your shoes in the years to come. Everyone thinks they can do your job better—until they actually have to do it and deliver. So even if you’re in a high-stress job, you need to take vacations. They’re important for your team.</p><p>And they’re a great time for you to try to sleep. For a long, long time, getting enough sleep for several days in a row was almost impossible.</p><p>I slept well, really well, before 1992. Before international email was a thing, let alone the internet and Twitter. Since then there has literally always been someone in some time zone somewhere wanting to talk to me at 4 a.m.</p><p>There will be no break unless you force yourself to take one. So do all the stuff they tell you to do before bed: no caffeine, no sugar, keep it cold, keep it dark, and for the love of all that’s holy, keep your phone away from your bed. You’re an addict. We all are. So don’t make it too easy for yourself—charge your phone in another room. Don’t be the alcoholic with a whiskey bottle in their nightstand (I wish I could say I do this every day, but hey—I’m human, too).</p><p>Then create time to breathe in your schedule. It’s all too easy to go from meeting to meeting to meeting, all day, with no chance to eat or go to the bathroom, never mind time to rest. But you have to. And I mean that literally. You have to do it. Otherwise you will fall apart. We’ve all seen (or been) parents with newborns on the brink of total collapse—that’s what it can feel like. Part of your job is not to go completely nuts at work and take it out on your team.</p><p>There’s a reason Steve Jobs famously always walked between meetings, during meetings. It helped him think, stay creative, to rummage, but it also forced him to take some time to just . . . walk. To take a break from sitting in meetings, even if it was just for a few minutes.</p><p>So look at your calendar. Engineer it. Design it.</p><p>Lay out the next three to six months on paper.</p><p>Write down what a typical day looks like.</p><p>And what a typical week or two weeks look like.</p><p>Keep going for the next month.</p><p>And then the next six.</p><p>Now start to reengineer your day, your week, and your monthly schedule with time dedicated to feeling human. It could be ten minutes after lunch where you read an interesting Medium article or six months from now when you take a week under a palm tree. But you have to engineer your schedule to include these breaks and then hold the line when people try to schedule over them.</p><p>So what will you do every few days or every week or two?</p><p>Every 8–12 weeks?</p><p>Every 6–12 months?</p><p>In the long term, you need to plan some vacations. In the short term, here’s what I recommend:</p><p>2–3 times a week—Block out parts of your schedule during your workday so you have time to think and reflect. Meditate. Read the news on some subject you don’t work on. Whatever. It can even be tangential to your work, but it should not be actual work. Give your brain a second to catch up. Learn, stay curious, don’t just react to the never-ending stream of fires to put out or meetings to attend.
4–6 times a week—Exercise. Get up. Go biking or running or weight lifting or cross-training or just take a walk. I started getting into yoga at Philips and I’ve kept it up for more than twenty-five years—it’s been hugely helpful. You have to quiet everything around you and focus to do yoga poses properly. You become conscious of your body so you instantly know if you’re off. Find something like that—where you’ll notice if you’re physically or emotionally at a breaking point and will have an opportunity to right yourself before it gets too bad.
Eat well—You are an extreme athlete, but your sport is work. So fuel yourself. Don’t eat too much, don’t eat too late, cut down on refined sugars, smoking, alcohol. Just try to keep yourself from physically feeling like garbage.
And if all this seems great in theory but completely impossible in practice because you can barely keep up with your emails, let alone make time to go to the gym or block out whole months of your life, then you may need to add something else to your to-do list: an assistant.</p><p>If you’re fairly high level (director or above) at a fairly large company managing a fairly large team, then you should consider an assistant. If you’re a CEO of any company, you should absolutely have one.</p><p>A lot of young leaders are uncomfortable hiring an assistant. I know I was. It felt like an admission of weakness, a sure sign of a hoity-toity exec who’s completely lost touch. And you don’t want to take advantage of someone—force an assistant to do “busy” work you really should be doing yourself. And anyway, you can’t hire an assistant before you hire an engineering director or fill that open position in sales—you have other priorities.</p><p>But as a leader, you also have a job to do. And if you’re spending a large portion of that job scheduling meetings and sorting through emails, or—worse—failing to do so, then there’s a problem. Everyone has met, or been, that kind of leader. This is the person who falls behind and accidentally ignores emails for two weeks, then books three meetings on top of each other and shows up to none of them. They’re so overwhelmed with scheduling their work that they can’t get any work done. These are the people who make themselves and their teams look bad. Who make their company look bad.</p><p>Do not become one of those people.</p><p>If you’re worried about the optics, just make the assistant a shared resource. A capable assistant can support three, four, or even five people. Or they can be a resource for your entire team—help them schedule their travel or figure out their expense reports or do some special project. They can help everyone.</p><p>Just remember, there’s no perfect assistant who will be able to read your mind immediately. What you’re looking for is someone who won’t gossip about you or the company but who will be friendly with everyone on the team so they can funnel worrisome gossip your way. You want someone who learns fast, only needs to be told once, and who, over time, can anticipate your needs and fix problems before they ever hit your desk. It can take three to six months for them to get a handle on how to be most helpful, but then it truly feels like you have a new superpower. It’s like you’ve gained another limb, or another six hours in the day.</p><p>This person isn’t just an employee. They’re a partner. So don’t fall into the stupid movie trope of using them as a lackey. My incredible, do-it-all, smart, and kind assistant Vicky once worked for a person who decided one day that he needed—absolutely needed—organic cantaloupe right away, even though he was in the middle of nowhere, and sent her on an hours-long hunt to find it. That is not how you treat a precious time machine who unlocks days, weeks of your life.</p><p>But sometimes even having an amazing assistant won’t be enough. Sometimes the pressure and stress and never-ending list and never-ending meetings will become too much. In those moments, get the hell out. Take a walk.</p><p>Sometimes when I just knew things were headed inexorably downhill, I left the office, rescheduled my meetings, and said, “Today is just one of those days—don’t make it worse than it already is.”</p><p>There are moments where you simply cannot function as a human, never mind a leader, and you need to recognize them and walk out the door. Don’t make a bad decision because you’re frustrated and overworked—get your head on straight and come in fresh the next day.</p><p>None of this is revolutionary. You probably learned it in elementary school: write down a list of what you need to do, take a deep breath and some quiet time if you’re upset, eat your vegetables, exercise, sleep. But you’ll forget. We all forget. So grab your calendar and make a plan. You’ll be working all the time for a while. That’s okay. It’s not forever. But you’ve probably been beating at your problems with the same hammer for too long—it’s time for your brain to rummage around and find a crowbar. Or a bulldozer. Give your mind some time to breathe.</p><p>Then put away your phone before bed. And maybe do some yoga.</p><p>Chapter 4.6
Crisis
You will encounter a crisis eventually. Everyone does. If you don’t, you’re not doing anything important or pushing any boundaries. When you’re creating something disruptive and new, you will at some point be blindsided by a complete disaster.</p><p>It may be an external crisis that you have no control over, or an internal screwup or just the kinds of growing pains that hit every company. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 5.2: Breakpoints.]<!-- --> Either way, when the time comes, here’s the basic playbook:</p><ol><li><p>Keep your focus on how to fix the problem, not who to blame. That will come later and is far too distracting early on.</p></li><li><p>As a leader, you’ll have to get into the weeds. Don’t be worried about micromanagement—as the crisis unfolds your job is to tell people what to do and how to do it. However, very quickly after everyone has calmed down and gotten to work, let them do their jobs without you breathing down their necks.</p></li><li><p>Get advice. From mentors, investors, your board, or anyone else you know who’s gone through something similar. Don’t try to solve your problems alone.</p></li><li><p>Your job once people get over the initial shock will be constant communication. You need to talktalktalk (with your team, the rest of the company, the board, investors, and potentially press and customers) and listenlistenlisten (hear what your team is worried about and the issues that are bubbling up, calm down panicked employees and stressed-out PR people). Don’t worry about overcommunicating.</p></li><li><p>It doesn’t matter if the crisis was caused by your mistake or your team or a fluke accident: accept responsibility for how it has affected customers and apologize.</p></li></ol><hr><p>One of the core features of the Nest Protect smoke and CO alarm was called Wave to Hush. The idea was that if you burned breakfast, you wouldn’t need to frantically wave towels or brooms at your smoke alarm to shut it up—you could just stand under it and calmly wave your arm a couple of times.</p><p>Wave to Hush worked beautifully. Customers loved it. More importantly, Nest Protect was really helping people. It wasn’t just solving the annoying false-alarm problem. We heard amazing stories of families who escaped fires and avoided carbon monoxide poisoning. We were immensely proud of this product and the lives and homes it saved.</p><p>And then, months after launch, during routine testing in our lab, a single flame grew much larger and higher than we’d ever seen. It rose, it danced . . . it waved. It fucking waved. And it hushed the alarm.</p><p>I’m not sure if I actually said “Okay, nobody panic,” but I definitely thought it. My heart sank. It felt like I’d gotten punched in the gut. We had to whip out the crisis playbook: first understand what level of issue this is. Was it replicable? Was it a fluke of one messed-up test? Was it real? And if it was real, was it likely? One-in-a-thousand chance or one in a billion? Because if it was real—and it was dangerous—then the next steps could be brutal: a product recall, alerting customers, notifying the authorities. Or, infinitely worse, this crazy flame could appear in an actual house fire. It could shut down our alarm just when someone needed it most.</p><p>We had to work furiously to parallel-path every possibility:</p><p>We needed to recall every single Nest Protect. This might kill our product, our brand reputation, and all our sales.
We can solve this with a software update.
This is just a testing error.
This wasn’t a moment to stand back and let the team figure out what to do on their own. I needed to make sure people knew exactly what they were working on and had the tools to find solutions as fast as possible. I had to command and control.</p><p>In a crisis, everyone has their job:</p><p>If you’re an individual contributor, you need to take your marching orders and start marching. Do your core job while continuing to look for and suggest other options to solve the issue. Try not to speculate or gossip. If you have concerns or suspicions, report them up the chain, then get back to work.
If you’re a manager, you need to relay information from leadership without overwhelming or distracting your team. Check in with the team a couple of times a day—try not to harass them more than that (hourly messages just freak everyone out). You need to be there for them, not just to ensure that the work is getting done, but also to make sure they’re okay. You’re the first line of defense against burnout. The pressure, stress, red-eyes, and bad food in the middle of the night will get to people. You may need to give everyone a break—even during a crisis.
Remember to set expectations and limits. You’ll probably have to work over the weekend. Okay. That happens. But tell your team what the plan is: we’ll work hard on Saturday but everyone needs to get out of the office at 5 p.m. and then we’ll have a check-in on Sunday night.</p><p>If you’re the leader of a broader group or company, you probably spent years of your life unlearning the tendencies of micromanagement. Well, if you’re in a crisis then it’s time to be a micromanager again.
You’ll need to dig into the details—all the details. But you can’t make every decision on your own or fix everything single-handedly. You have experts, so you’ll need to delegate to them. Agree on the micro-steps that need to be taken, but allow them to take those steps without you. Schedule check-ins in the morning and at the end of the day and instead of getting the usual weekly or biweekly reports from your team, start going to their daily meetings. You have to be in there, listening, asking questions, and getting necessary information in real time. You might have to be the conduit of that information to the rest of the company, to investors or reporters or whoever else is watching this situation like a hawk. You need to be able to answer their questions. You need to keep up their confidence that you’re getting somewhere.</p><p>Clear your calendar of nonessential meetings. Focus entirely on fixing the problem. And don’t let yourself get knocked off balance—you’re human. Don’t make things worse by losing your mind and ignoring the things you need to keep your head on straight. That might be exercising or resting or having dinner with your family or lying on the floor under your desk for ten minutes quietly singing show tunes. Whatever you need. And remember, your team is human, too—people need to go home. They need to sleep. They need to eat. And they need to feel like things are getting better.</p><p>So keep their focus on your solutions, not who’s to blame for getting you into this mess in the first place. Everyone will be going through the hypotheticals—what if it was this team’s fault? Were they cutting corners? Gossip will be flying, along with accusations. But getting to the bottom of the screwup is not your team’s job. It’s not even your job. Not in the beginning.</p><p>You’ll get there eventually, but you need to dig yourself out of your hole first. You need to solve for what went wrong and what you’re going to do about it, then circle back for the why.</p><p>Don’t forget that even when everyone calms down after the initial shock wears off and gets back to work, they’re probably still freaking out internally, just like you. Especially if the task to find a way out of this disaster now rests on their shoulders. Make sure people who are struggling have an open line to talk to you or their manager. Command and control doesn’t mean decree and ignore.</p><p>You’re landing a dozen jets on an aircraft carrier at the same time—while giving press briefings and occasional therapy sessions. You will be incredibly worried, but you can’t tear your hair out—I strongly recommend being bald already. The only thing you can do is calmly say, “Yes. I’m worried. Just like you. This is scary. But we’ll get through it. We’ve faced other challenges in the past together and succeeded. Here’s the plan.”</p><p>That’s what I said over and over at Nest. It became like a mantra: We’ll get through this. We’ve done it before. Here’s the plan. We’ll get through this. We’ve done it before. Here’s the plan.</p><p>Thankfully we never saw that bizarrely tall, narrow flame in the field—only in testing. It turned out to be one of those fluke things that we couldn’t have anticipated or designed around. Nobody’s fault. And it was very, very unlikely to happen in the real world. But that didn’t matter.</p><p>The solution was to pull Nest Protect off shelves while we investigated and turn off Wave to Hush with a software update. You could still silence the alarm from your phone, but you couldn’t wave at it. And we told customers exactly what happened. No cover-up. Mea culpa and here’s a refund if you want one.</p><p>And it worked. Nest Protect and our brand survived.</p><p>There is always a temptation to obfuscate or couch everything in legalese—to say “mistakes were made” but never admit they were yours. This will not work. People will figure it out. And they will be pissed.</p><p>If something is your fault, tell them what you did. Tell them what you’ve learned from it. And tell them how you’ll prevent it from ever happening again. No evading, blaming, or making excuses. Just accept responsibility and be a grown-up.</p><p>Every failure is a learning experience. A complete meltdown is a PhD program.</p><p>You’ll get through it. Just remember that you don’t have to get through it alone. In moments of crisis, it’s critical to talk to someone who can give you useful advice. No matter how much you know, how good you are, there is always a person out there who can help you unlock a potential solution. Someone who’s done it before and who can show you the way out of the tunnel.</p><p>Sometimes the terrible, unsolvable, unpredictable crisis you’re facing is actually something that most growing companies face and for which there’s an obvious solution that you just can’t see. You might simply be growing really fast and need to codify your culture and add a management layer and start sending out meeting notes differently. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 5.2: Breakpoints.]</p><p>So whenever you see the water rising, talk to your mentor. Or your board. Or your investors.</p><p>It’s your responsibility as a leader not to try to deal with a disaster on your own. Don’t lock yourself in a room, alone, frantically trying to fix it. Don’t hide. Don’t disappear. Don’t imagine that by working for a week straight and not sleeping you can solve the problem yourself and nobody ever has to know. Get advice. Take deep breaths. Make a plan.</p><p>Then put on your rain boots and walk into the tidal wave.</p><p>The silver lining is that once the crisis is past—assuming you survived it, of course—you’ll have a team that’s gone through hell and back and is stronger for it. You’ll have time to go figure out the why—why did this happen in the first place? And what can we do so it doesn’t happen again? That may mean someone gets fired or the team reorganizes or the way you communicate with each other drastically changes. The process may be lengthy and unpleasant.</p><p>But after it’s over you should celebrate. You should have a party. And you should tell the story.</p><p>The most valuable thing you’ll take out of any crisis is the tale of how you were almost swept away, but the team pulled together and saved the day. That story needs to enter into the DNA of your company so you can always return to it.</p><p>There will be more disasters in your future. There will be many moments when everything falls apart. But if you can keep telling that story, no crisis to come will ever feel quite as bleak as the very first one you conquered. Because you can always turn to your team and say, “Look. Look what we survived together. If we got through that, we can get through anything.”</p><p>It’s a useful corporate tool to remind people what can happen, what you’ve learned, and how to avoid similar disasters in the future. The story is handy managerially and as a cultural touchstone. But, most importantly, it’s true: your team got through this. Now they can get through anything.</p><p>Part V
Build Your Team
By the time I left Nest in 2016, the company stretched across three buildings in Palo Alto and two more in Europe. We had almost one thousand employees, multiple product lines, ever-expanding sales partnerships in multiple countries, millions of customers, giant posters espousing our company values on the walls, black-tie holiday parties. But even with the slings and arrows of acquisition and rapid growth, Nest still felt like Nest.</p><p>And that’s because of exactly one thing: the people.</p><p>The source of all Nestiness—the key to our success—was the human beings we hired, the culture they created, the way they thought and organized and worked together. The team was everything.</p><p>Forming that team and shepherding it through its many transitions is always the hardest and most rewarding part of building anything. And with Nest that was true from the first moment—before we had customers, before we even had a product.</p><p>When all we had were the squirrels.</p><p>They’d wander into our meetings a lot. And of course the rain was also a problem—we’d often have to cover the floor in buckets. The garage door made a ridiculous racket whenever the wind blew, there was exactly one ghastly pink marble bathroom for the whole team, and the beaten-up eighties-era chairs were truly terrible, especially the big pleather executive ones. I don’t think there was a chair in the entire place that had all four legs on the ground.</p><p>It was exactly what we wanted.</p><p>It was the summer of 2010 in Palo Alto and the garage we’d rented was bordered by the vast, beautiful campuses of tech giants and countless shiny startups luring in employees with promises of plush offices and free beer and flexible work hours.</p><p>But none of that mattered to us. Matt and I were serious, focused, and we were hiring people who had that same sense of purpose, who wouldn’t be dazzled by glitz or glamour or in-office pool tables. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 6.4: Fuck Massages.]<!-- --> We were having plenty of fun, but none of us were screwing around.</p><p>By that point the team was around ten to fifteen people, the very beginnings of Nest.</p><p>A lot of the early employees were from Apple. A few I’d known since General Magic. Another since college. Our VP of marketing was a friend of a friend from Philips. Most of the team already had a ton of success in their careers.</p><p>But we all balanced precariously on the same crappy chairs. Furniture and snacks and decor all take money and, more critically, time. Someone has to sit and think about whether we should get a brown couch or a blue one, which fruit, which cheese, which beer. And we were not going to waste a cent or a minute on anything that wasn’t critical to the business. We were going to show our investors that this was a world-class team who could perform miracles on a shoestring. With every squirrel invasion and ceiling leak our team was declaring that we were the opposite of every startup in the Valley that was lavishing money on their offices and launching nothing. All of us were singularly committed to exactly one thing: our mission.</p><p>Those people in that garage and that urgent need to prove our vision formed the core of the hard-driving, mission-driven culture that defined Nest.</p><p>Growing that team the right way—breaking down who we needed, how to hire them, how to build team processes and ways of thinking—was just as important as building the right product.</p><p>We borrowed some structures and norms from companies and cultures we liked, and the rest we created from scratch. We figured it out as we went, tweaked and adjusted, until we created teams and cultures that together could create something amazing.</p><p>So if you’re trying to build a team, figuring out how and who to hire, then here’s what I’ve learned about some of the key teams and competencies of most startups:</p><p>Design</p><p>Marketing</p><p>Product management</p><p>Sales</p><p>Legal</p><p>And what I learned when those teams grew. And grew. And grew.</p><p>Chapter 5.1
Hiring
A near-perfect team is made up of smart, passionate, imperfect people who complement one another. As that team grows beyond ten, twenty, fifty people, you’ll need:</p><p>»  Eager new grads and interns to learn from your experienced, well-seasoned crew. Every young person you spend time training is an investment in the long-term health of your company.</p><p>»  A defined hiring process that ensures that candidates interview with people from across the company who they’ll work with directly.</p><p>»  A thoughtful approach to growth to avoid watering down your culture.</p><p>»  Processes that ensure new employees are immersed in and build on your culture from day one.</p><p>»  A way to keep HR and hiring top of mind for your leadership team and the management teams under them. It should be the first topic of business in every team meeting.</p><p>You’ll also need to fire people. Don’t be scared of it, but don’t be callous, either. Give people plenty of warning and opportunity to course correct, follow the letter of the law, then bite the bullet and help them find a better opportunity.</p><hr><p>One of the first people who joined Nest after me and Matt was Isabel Guenette. She was twenty-two years old, fresh out of college, brilliant and empathetic and immensely kind, ready to change the world. We hired her because we needed help researching the endless list of things we didn’t know: What are the hundreds of heating systems that exist in the United States? What wires do most people have in their walls?</p><p>It didn’t matter that she didn’t know how to build thermostats—none of us knew how to build thermostats. That was the point. We needed to learn. So Isabel dove in.</p><p>She learned so much so fast that she became the product manager for the thermostat and successfully launched three versions over the course of five years. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 5.5: The Point of PMs.]</p><p>Isabel made herself successful because she’s smart and curious and capable. But some of her success also came from the fact that she was young. She may not have realized how difficult the task was before her—she just did it. And she did it with joy.</p><p>The best teams are multigenerational—Nest employed twenty-year-olds and seventy-year-olds. Experienced people have a wealth of wisdom that they can pass on to the next generation and young people can push back against long-held assumptions. They can often see the opportunity that lies in accomplishing difficult things, while experienced people see only the difficulty.</p><p>And they can grow with your company. The tried-and-true employees who joined your business in the beginning will leave eventually. Everyone leaves eventually. But before they go, you want them to mentor and train an army of young people. That’s how you keep your company going. That’s how you create a legacy.</p><p>You don’t want to look around ten years after you launch and realize there’s nobody under thirty-five working at your business.</p><p>Nest policy was always to hire a mix of new grads and to host an intern program. It was not a popular policy—not at first. The hiring managers bitched and moaned. They wanted to hire people with a ton of experience, dump a pile of work on their heads, and just let them dig themselves out.</p><p>And there’s a place for that. There should always be someone on the team—or many someones—who’s done it before and can do it again.</p><p>But if you look at a promising young kid or enthusiastic career switcher and see only how much time they’ll take to train or the chance that they won’t work out, then you’re forgetting the power and drive of an ambitious talent right on the cusp of figuring out who they’re going to be.</p><p>Someone took a risk on you once. Someone guided you through your mistakes, took the time to help you grow. Not only is it your duty to create that moment for the next generation, but it’s also a good investment in the long-term success of your company.</p><p>Out of every ten interns we brought on each year, one to three would get offers to return again next summer or would just be hired full-time.</p><p>Even those we didn’t ask back worked on real stuff, shipped real features, and made it closer to knowing what they wanted to do. Some even changed majors when they figured out what their initial career choice meant for their future. And that’s what they told their friends. Suddenly over a few summers we had a pipeline of all the brilliant rising talent from the world’s best universities.</p><p>That’s when the hiring managers stopped bitching.</p><p>It is a battle to find amazing talent. You cannot afford to ignore any part of the population when you’re trying to grow your team—there are pools of outstanding young and old and female and male and trans and nonbinary and Black and Latino and Asian and Southeast Asian and Middle Eastern and European and Indigenous people in the world who can have a profound impact on your company. Different people think differently and every new perspective, background, and experience you bring into the business improves the business. It deepens your understanding of your customers. It illuminates part of the world that you were blind to before. It creates opportunities.</p><p>Hiring a diverse and talented team is so incredibly crucial to your success that you’ll want to interview every person who joins your company yourself. But you can’t. You only have twenty-four hours in a day. The seed crystals will work for only so long. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 4.2: Are You Ready?: Seed crystals.]<!-- --> And eventually you’ll have to trust the team to make its own choices.</p><p>But that doesn’t mean hiring should be a free-for-all. You need a process. And the ones I’ve seen don’t cut it.</p><p>Companies usually follow one of two methods for hiring:</p><p>Old school—The hiring manager finds a candidate, sets up interviews with a few people on their team, then hires the candidate. Simple. Straightforward. Stupid.
New school—The decision for whether to hire someone gets distributed across a ton of (typically random) employees and a fancy recruitment tool. So a candidate interviews with a bunch of people and those people enter their feedback into an evaluation form, the recruitment tool spits out a summary, then the hiring manager can bring on the candidate if they hit all the metrics. Idealistic. Novel. Stupid.
The old-school method ignores too many people at the company. The new-school method involves people who don’t have enough context to make a thoughtful decision and burns people out. As you grow and can no longer rely on referrals from existing employees, you may need to bring in fifteen candidates to fill a single slot. Ask too many people to take on the burden of interviewing those candidates and they’ll start to resent it, detest it, and do the bare minimum to fill out the evaluation form and get back to work.</p><p>The key is to get the candidate talking to the right people.</p><p>Nobody works in a vacuum. Everybody has internal customers—people they need to deliver to. App designers, for example, create designs for engineers to implement. In this instance, engineers are their customers. So if you’re hiring an app designer, you’d better make sure they interview with an engineer.</p><p>That was the system we had at Nest. We called it the Three Crowns. Here’s how it worked:</p><p>Crown 1 was the hiring manager. They got the role approved and found the candidates.
Crowns 2 and 3 were managers of the candidate’s internal customers. They picked one or two people from their team to interview the candidate.
Feedback was collected, shared, and discussed, then the Three Crowns met to decide who to hire.
Matt or I would watch over it all and make the final call in the rare instance when the Crowns couldn’t agree. Typically the answer if we had to get involved was no, thank you: PASS.
Even when we accepted a candidate, there was always an awareness that nobody is perfect. There were always critiques, challenges. So it was the hiring manager’s job to understand potential issues from the outset, talk them through with leadership and the candidate, and commit to coaching their new team member through those challenges.</p><p>There was no mystery, no black box. Everything was on the record. Everyone knew what to expect.</p><p>Then we committed. We hired them. And despite any concerns, any potential areas for improvement, everyone started with 100 percent trust. Once you assess someone thoroughly, check references, and decide to hire them—you also have to decide to trust them. You can’t start with zero trust and expect someone to prove themselves to you.</p><p>Whenever you’re embarking on any journey—a new employee, a new job, a new partnership—you have to believe it’ll work. Believe that people will do right by you. Of course, there will be disappointments—some people will knock your trust down to 90 percent, to 50 percent, to zero—but if you let that keep you from trusting others, you’ll never know the relationships and opportunities you missed.</p><p>You can’t afford that. Hiring is too important. You’re going to need all the help you can get.</p><p>That’s why it’s also essential to have great recruiters—ones who are as excited about the company and the product as you are.</p><p>Our first recruiter at Nest was Jose Cong. We knew we had to have Jose—he gave us recruiting superpowers on the iPod and iPhone teams. How could Nest not have him, too? And the thing that sets Jose apart is twofold—he has a great eye for talent, and he is incredibly, unflappably, immensely enthusiastic. That enthusiasm is infectious and—most critically—honest. He was 100 percent sure that Nest would change the world and he’d tell the “why”—the story of the company—with the kind of zeal and joy that genuinely inspired and excited candidates. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 3.2: Why Storytelling.]</p><p>Jose would bring amazing candidate after amazing candidate through our door. And then it was up to us—we had to figure out if they were right for the team. We had to interview them.</p><p>So we set up some ground rules. Everyone on the team knew what we interviewed for and what we cared about so they could calibrate on more or less the same things. We expected candidates to be mission-driven and good on their feet, the right fit for the culture, and passionate about the customer. We also had a “no assholes” policy. Pretty self-explanatory, but very helpful. If someone walked in with a ton of experience and was exactly what we were looking for on paper, but came off as unbearably arrogant or dismissive or controlling or political, then that résumé would be tossed out.</p><p>Of course, to figure out if someone you interview is an asshole, you have to know how to interview them.</p><p>This will come as a shock to absolutely no one, but I am not the world’s most easygoing interviewer. I really dig in, try to understand a candidate’s psyche, maybe even stress them out a little to see how they deal with stress. Everyone has different styles, but you can’t be so low-key that you never dip below the surface, never push to understand who this person really is. An interview isn’t about carefree small talk. You’re there for a reason.</p><p>In an interview I’m always most interested in three basic things: who they are, what they’ve done, and why they did it. I usually start with the most important questions: “What are you curious about? What do you want to learn?”</p><p>I also ask, “Why did you leave your last job?” Not the most original question, but the answer matters. I’m looking for a crisp, clear story. If they complain about a bad manager or being the victim of politics, I ask what they did about it. Why didn’t they fight harder? And did they leave a mess behind them? What did they do to make sure they left in the right way? <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 2.4: I Quit.]</p><p>And why do they want to join this company? That reason had better be completely different from why they left their previous job. They should have a new story, a compelling story, about what they’re excited about, who they want to work with, and how they want to grow and develop.</p><p>Another good interview technique is to simulate work—instead of asking them how they work, just work with them. Pick a problem and try to solve it together. Choose a subject that both of you are familiar with but neither is an expert in—if you pick a problem in their domain they’ll always sound smart; pick a problem in yours and you’ll always know better. But the subject doesn’t matter nearly as much as the process of watching them think. Get on the whiteboard, draw it out. What kinds of questions do they ask? What approaches do they suggest? Do they ask about the customer? Do they seem empathetic or oblivious?</p><p>You’re not just interviewing to see if a person can do the job required of them today. You’re trying to understand if they have the innate tools to think through the problems and jobs you don’t see coming yet—the jobs they can grow into tomorrow.</p><p>Startups are always evolving, as are the people inside them. Knowing that and trusting the team and building a real hiring process allowed Nest to grow to 100, 200, 700 people.</p><p>But we were careful not to grow too fast. We wanted to hold on to our starting-team DNA—the urgency and focus of that small group in the garage, wobbling around on those terrible chairs. And the only way to do that was to integrate new people into the culture at a reasonable pace, so they could learn by doing, by watching, by working with the team and absorbing the culture organically. The best way to share and embed cultural DNA is person to person. When you’re growing fast, the new people you just hired most likely have some responsibility to hire as well, so a week of orientation isn’t going to cut it.</p><p>If you have fifty people who understand your culture and add a hundred who don’t, you will lose that culture. It’s just math.</p><p>So when bringing in new employees—especially execs—you shouldn’t just throw them in the deep end, hand them a branded company notebook, and think you’re done. The first month or two are crucial and should be a period of positive micromanagement. Don’t worry about getting too in the weeds or not giving them enough freedom. Not at first. A brand-new person needs all the help they can get to become really well integrated. Explain how you do things in detail so they don’t make mistakes and alienate the rest of the team right off the bat. Talk to them about what’s working and what isn’t, what you would do in their position, what’s encouraged and what’s verboten, who to ask for help and who to treat with kid gloves.</p><p>That’s the best way to immerse someone in the culture, style, and processes of a team. Give them the push they need to start running with the pack rather than leaving them standing on the starting line, reading some docs, hoping they’ll catch up.</p><p>Always remember that it’s scary joining a new team. Not knowing anyone. Not knowing if you’ll fit in. Not knowing if you’ll succeed.</p><p>That’s why I started doing brown-bag lunches with the CEO. Matt did them too. Every two to four weeks, we’d gather a crew of 15–25 new hires and existing employees and have an informal lunch. We tried to cross-pollinate different people from different groups, a good mix from around the company. No managers, no executives, no keynote presentations. Just an opportunity for them to get to know the bogeyman at the top and for me to get to know them. They asked me about our products, our policies, about me and Matt and our history at Apple. About why we didn’t allow massages, about why we had so many code names. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 6.4: Fuck Massages.]<!-- --> And I asked about what they were excited about, what they were working on, why they joined.</p><p>It was my chance to highlight why their role was important, to talk about how their team’s goals powered our company goals, about our culture and our products and new projects and what was going right and what wasn’t. New employees had the chance to come directly to me with their questions as well as meet existing employees who were already steeped in our culture, who could help them and lead by example.</p><p>Any employee could come to five lunches a year. And each lunch was a cultural inoculation, a vaccine against indifference and apathy, against thinking that what you do doesn’t matter and that nobody at the top knows who you are.</p><p>And so we grew. Teams branched off and individuated. Individual contributors became managers. Managers became directors.</p><p>Many people rose to the challenge. Many exceeded all expectations. And some didn’t. Sometimes it will turn out that the people you hired early aren’t right for the team as you grow. Or sometimes you hired the wrong people right out of the gate. Or you hired mediocre people. Or you hired people who weren’t a good fit for your culture, despite being spectacular otherwise.</p><p>Sometimes you hire people who just won’t be successful at your company.</p><p>And then you need to fire them.</p><p>But it’s important to remember that while the moment of conflict is always miserable, that moment is brief and it’s your job not to fixate on it, not to dwell in it for too long. You have to quickly move from “this isn’t working” to “now I’m going to do everything I can to help you find a job you like that’s better for you.” It’s counterintuitive, but firing someone from a job they’re failing at and utterly unsuited to can be a surprisingly positive experience. I’ve never fired someone where it didn’t end up being better for both them and the company.</p><p>Sometimes life is the process of elimination. Sometimes getting fired can be a good thing. But the one thing it should never be is a surprise (unless they committed a crime; and you’d be surprised—I’ve seen that multiple times in my career).</p><p>Under normal circumstances nobody should ever be shocked that they’re getting fired or have to ask why it’s happening. They may not agree, of course. But anyone who’s struggling should be having weekly or twice-monthly 1:1 meetings about that struggle. That’s where issues are honestly discussed, solutions are attempted, and there’s a follow-up about what worked and what didn’t and what’s going to happen next.</p><p>Just as people make a commitment to your company when they join it, you make a commitment to them. If you’re leading a company or a large org, it is your responsibility to help people identify their challenge areas and give them space and coaching to get better or help them to find a spot at the company where they can be successful.</p><p>But even with all the goodwill and good intentions in the world, sometimes it’ll become obvious to you and to the person on their way out that their issues are unsolvable, the team has lost confidence in them, and the world is full of other wonderful opportunities, with other, much less miserable jobs that you will happily help them find. And that’s when they’ll leave, usually of their own accord.</p><p>The process may take a month. Or two. Or three. But usually it ends amicably and everyone is better for it.</p><p>Then again, sometimes you realize you hired an asshole.</p><p>An asshole at a tiny startup can be the end of the startup. But assholes can ruin teams and products at any stage of growth, at any size company. The bigger the team, the easier it is to sneak in and start poisoning the well.</p><p>If you’re managing a petty, untrustworthy tyrant, then the knee-jerk reaction will be to cut that cancer out as fast as possible. But you’ll still have to take your time—tell them the situation, give them an opportunity to turn it around. The rules for firing people differ depending on where you live, so it’s important to understand them and follow them exactly. Many people will happily sue you if they believe they’ve been fired incorrectly. Many people you thought would be great can end up dragging your whole organization down.</p><p>That’s one of the most painful things about growth—in the beginning you have this incredible core of people who you know you can climb mountains with. But that phase doesn’t last forever—eventually you need to add more and more and more people to the team. Sometimes you’ll screw up and hire assholes or people who just can’t perform or adapt to the culture. But more often the real shock of growth is that over time you’ll bring on people who are just okay. Relative to the amazing people you brought in early, they’ll seem unimpressive. Mostly fine, good team players, get the job done.</p><p>And that’s not the end of the world. As the company expands, you need all kinds of people at all kinds of levels.</p><p>You can’t wait for the perfect A+ candidate to appear for every single empty slot. You need to hire. The best of the best don’t always want to join a big team, or they’re tied up in another job, or you can’t afford them or give them the titles or responsibilities they want.</p><p>And sometimes the people you don’t expect to be amazing—the ones you thought were Bs and B+s—turn out to completely rock your world. They hold your team together by being dependable and flexible and great mentors and teammates. They’re modest and kind and just quietly do good work. They’re a different type of “rock star.”</p><p>By far the hardest part of growth is finding the best people—in all their different incarnations—trusting your team to hire them, then making sure they’re happy and thriving.</p><p>So don’t flinch away from it. Make it your first order of business. Make it everyone’s priority.</p><p>At many companies I’ve seen HR topics left to the end of team meetings, or lumped into a separate HR or recruiting meeting. But your priority is your team, its health and growth. The best way to show that is to make it the first agenda item each and every week.</p><p>Every Monday morning at Nest, that’s how my management meetings started: Who are the great people we want to hire? Are we making our hiring goals or retention metrics? If not, what’s the problem? What are the roadblocks? And how is the team doing? What issues do people have? How are performance reviews going? Who needs a bonus? How are we going to celebrate these accomplishments so the team feels valued? And, most importantly, are people leaving? Why? How are we going to make this job more meaningful and fulfilling and exciting than anything else out there? How are we going to help our people grow?</p><p>Only after we got through this important subject could we move on to anything else—like what the hell we were building.</p><p>The managers on the team saw it was important to me, so that’s how they started structuring their weekly meetings with their teams. It became the Nest way. People first. Always.</p><p>What you’re building never matters as much as who you’re building it with.</p><p>Chapter 5.2
Breakpoints
Growth will break your company. As more people join, your organizational design and communication style need to keep up or you risk alienating the team and cratering your culture.</p><p>Breakpoints almost always come when you need to add new layers of management, inevitably leading to communication problems, confusion, and slowdowns. In the early days of a company, when most people are self-managing, the absolute maximum number of people one human being can effectively manage directly is 8–15 full-time employees. As the company grows, that number shrinks to around 7–8. When teams approach that point, you need to preemptively create a management layer, ideally by promoting from within, and then put systems in place to ensure effective and efficient communication.</p><p>In order to keep breakpoints from actually breaking your company and causing employees to flee en masse, put management changes in place early, talk to the team about the new plan, and mentor them as they shift into different roles.</p><hr><p>If you have a team of six, then six days of the year it’s someone’s birthday.</p><p>So you get a cake, take the afternoon to celebrate. It’s nice.</p><p>When you have a team of three hundred, there’s a birthday practically every day. Should we still celebrate each one? The whole team can’t keep taking the afternoon off. And do you still get cake? Is cake important to your culture? You want to do everything you can for your team but there are hard realities. There are deadlines. There are budgets. And people are expensing a lot of goddamn cake.</p><p>The cake is a microcosm of the larger problems of growth, but I’m also speaking literally. Turns out people get weirdly defensive about cake. It’s always a mini-crisis when you have to stop having all-company birthday parties for individual employees.</p><p>Growth can catch you off-guard like that. Because everything always falls apart just when it feels like nothing can stop you. Breakpoints typically come at moments when things are going great—business is booming or at least product development is humming along. It seems like you’ve finally figured it out and are on your way.</p><p>But it’s kind of like having kids. Just when you think you’ve got a handle on things—they’re eating! they’re sleeping! they’re walking (and getting into everything)!—your kids grow. That phase is over. Walking is old news. And everything that was working up until now utterly fails you.</p><p>It always happens. Always. And the only thing you can do is embrace it.</p><p>I’ve had many conversations with entrepreneurs who told me they hate it when companies grow past 120 people, so they won’t let that happen in their own startup. But I’ve never seen it work—not for any successful business.</p><p>It’s either grow or die. Stasis is stagnation. Change is the only option.</p><p>But that doesn’t make it any easier.</p><p>Breakpoints happen in the transitions between team sizes. Whether we’re talking about independent businesses or teams within a larger company, shifting between these size groups is always hard:</p><p>UP TO 15–16 PEOPLE</p><p>image
Fig. 5.2.1</p><p>A team can easily work together until about fifteen people. Informal conversation flows naturally, team meetings happen when they absolutely have to, nobody really pays attention to the org chart and it has no impact on how information moves around the business. In those early days, you should try to keep the org as flat as possible for as long as possible, but you’ll need to add a management layer when one person has to manage more than eight to twelve people.</p><p>Matteo Vianello</p><p>Organization: Everyone does a bit of everything and almost all decisions, major and minor, are made together. There’s no need for management because the team leader helps drive the vision and decisions, but more or less acts like a peer.</p><p>Communication: Happens naturally. Everyone is in the same room (or chat room), most likely hearing all the same conversations, so there are no information bottlenecks or need for regular meetings.</p><p>UP TO 40–50 PEOPLE</p><p>image
Fig. 5.2.2</p><p>As you grow past fifteen people, a layer gets added between the CEO or leader and the rest of the team. It’s at this point that silos can begin to form and communication can break down, as information is no longer evenly distributed. Some people will decide to stay as individual contributors, some will become managers. Make sure you prepare any potential managers to take the reins—don’t just throw them into the deep end. To keep the org flat, try to avoid situations where managers only have two to three direct reports long term. If you’re growing fast, you’ll also need to hire senior leaders who can be hands-on—these people will grow into their roles as your company grows.</p><p>Matteo Vianello</p><p>Organization: When you go beyond 15–16 people, sub-teams of up to 7–10 people begin to form. Some people from your original core group will have to narrow their responsibilities and start managing, but the team is still so small that everything remains pretty flexible and informal.</p><p>Communication: For the first time, you’ll have meetings that not everyone can attend, so some people will have information that others won’t. You’ll need to formalize your interaction style slightly—take notes, send out updates, make sure everyone stays synced up.</p><p>UP TO 120–140 PEOPLE</p><p>image
Fig. 5.2.3</p><p>Now you have two layers between the CEO or leader and much of the team doing the day-to-day work of running the business, so communication has to be rethought again. Managers begin to manage managers, so you’ll need to bring in management coaches to help you find out who’s doing well, who could be a manager in the future, and who just needs a little help. You’ll need to find ways to effectively communicate to the team, ensure that managers are communicating that same information to their teams, and make sure information from throughout the org funnels to the top. Lack of transparency from the bottom to the top and from the top to the bottom can breed distrust. Where there’s a lack of data, distrust fills that void.</p><p>Matteo Vianello</p><p>Organization: As you grow past 50 people, some people become managers of managers—which is a very different beast than just managing individual contributors—and HR is really coming into play for the first time. You need proper processes to deal with promotions, defining job duties and hierarchical levels, and benefits. You’ll also really need to figure out job titles.</p><p>Functional teams grow, and sub-teams within the larger teams form. Each team begins to develop its own work style around the types of work they do. Specialization is more and more necessary. Many team members begin to pick a lane and focus on a particular area, rather than have the (double-edged) luxury of being a jack-of-all-trades.</p><p>Communication: Inter-team communication has to be formalized, as do meetings with leadership. Hallway conversations won’t cut it anymore. You need regular all-hands meetings where teams keep each other in the loop and execs are called upon to unite, inform, and inspire.</p><p>The execs of the company really have to nail down their communication style at this point: how do you connect with your leadership team and set priorities, how do you run meetings, how do you present to the entire company? Leadership starts to meet with HR weekly to manage the explosion of people issues.</p><p>UP TO 350–400 PEOPLE</p><p>Organization: At this point you may have multiple projects competing for the same resources. Leadership is much more isolated and distant from the actual product and spends most of its time managing org charts and conflicting priorities between teams.</p><p>Communication: Meetings are probably getting out of control and information is getting bottlenecked. You’ll need to restructure your meetings and rethink your communication style. All-hands meetings will be rarer and all about reinforcing the vision for the company rather than distributing tactical information, which means there need to be other ways for people to easily access and disseminate relevant info.</p><p>In today’s all-remote world, all of this is still true. And it’s even more important. When the watercooler disappears and spontaneous, unstructured communication disappears along with it, you have to be even more thoughtful, disciplined, and intentional about your communication strategies. You have to give people a road map to connect with each other.</p><p>And always remember that growth is not a step function. It’s not like you do just fine at 119 people but at 120 everything falls apart. You have to start forming a strategy for how you’ll grow past a breakpoint long before you reach it—at a minimum two to three months before the break and then months of follow-up after. Think through your org design, your communication styles, figure out if you’ll need to train individual contributors to become managers or bring in new blood, adjust your meetings, see if people scale or not. And you’ll have to talk to people. A lot.</p><p>Consistency is key. If you’re leading a project at a big company or running your own startup, you are going to have to coach the entire team through these transitions. The company is going through puberty, and a few awkward but critical conversations need to happen well before the first rogue armpit hair is spotted. You can even use the same language: this happens to every growing, thriving business. It’s natural. Don’t worry.</p><p>But you’ll also need to speak openly about how it’s scary for them and for you and for the company. Acknowledge that there are things that you’ll lose, and that those losses will not be easy. Involve managers and individuals in the process so it doesn’t just come out of left field, like something that was done to them that they have no control over. You need their help to get it right so they can define, own, and embrace the changes.</p><p>If you can see it coming, you can design your future.</p><p>But first you have to get past the fear. So here’s what’s going to scare people most and how to help them through it.</p><p>SPECIALIZATION</p><p>Every organism starts as a single cell. That cell divides into two, four, sixteen. In the beginning each cell is the same, but quickly they break out and individualize. This one is going to be a nerve, this one a muscle. The more the organism grows, the more differentiated each cell has to be, the more complicated the system becomes. But it also becomes more resilient, able to survive for years, decades.</p><p>The same happens in business. But people are not stem cells. Sometimes you’ll work with a specialist who’s thrilled by the idea of focusing on just one element of their job, but for most people narrowing their responsibility doesn’t feel natural and inevitable—it freaks them out. And this process is particularly terrifying in the very beginning, after everyone gets used to doing everything, when there are virtually no management layers and you all just agree on a direction and start sprinting. But it happens later as well—even at big companies. Even at huge ones.</p><p>The fear is that everyone used to do all these cool, different things and now someone is going to come and take them away.</p><p>So focus people’s attention on the opportunity: help them get curious about what their job could become, instead of being fearful of what they might lose. Do they want to be a manager? A team lead? Do they want to learn more about some other area of the business or dig deeper into something they really enjoy? What do they want to learn?</p><p>The first steps are to help them understand what they truly love about their jobs, the company, and the culture. Then they can work with their managers to retain those things and unload the stuff they don’t actually like. Or they can use this moment to start something completely new.</p><p>Just keep reminding everyone that this is their opportunity to choose their path. They’re in charge of their career. Tell them: project yourself into the future and figure out who you want to become and what you want to do.</p><p>ORG DESIGN</p><p>Just as people need to specialize as a company grows, so do teams. When you have only one product, you can organize by function: one hardware engineering team, a single software engineering team, etc. But as you add more product lines, that organization slows you down. It could break with just two products or it might break at five. But it will break eventually.</p><p>The problem is usually the people at the top—the team leaders can keep only so many projects in their heads. They can focus on three, four, five projects but by the time they get to six or seven their brains are fried. There just aren’t enough hours in the day. So those projects get sidelined for later, and later never comes.</p><p>You’ll need to break your org into product specific groups so that each product gets the attention it deserves. This team works on the thermostat, this team works on the smoke alarm. And then you might have to subdivide again. At Nest we ended up creating a team for accessories; otherwise they’d have never gotten made. The mainline team would always say they’d get to it but the accessories projects were never their first priority, so they’d inevitably prioritize other things.</p><p>Amazon, Square, Stripe, Twilio—pretty much every team with multiple product lines has had to re-org this way.</p><p>Each product family gets a dedicated engineering team, a dedicated marketing person, a dedicated designer and writer. And that turns them into little startups inside the business—smaller, faster, more autonomous. Decisions speed up and everyone shares one clear goal rather than scrambling for resources on a side project.</p><p>It just works better. But that’s not to say that people will be happy about it. Groups don’t enjoy being narrowed any more than individual contributors do.</p><p>But the conversation you had with individual contributors about their personal trajectory can be used again as the group trajectory narrows. Breaking things up this way flattens the org, eliminates a ton of overhead, and creates more opportunity for growth, more chances to dig in and find something you can excel at and be recognized for.</p><p>In any case, people can always switch teams. Launch another version of the old thing, then switch over to the shiny new thing. Try the thermostat, then the smoke alarm. If someone’s engaged and excited, there’s always wiggle room.</p><p>GOING FROM INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTORS TO MANAGERS</p><p>Many times a star performer will be asked to lead a new growing team. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 2.1: Just Managing.]<!-- --> Some people will embrace the idea of management, but others will recoil in horror. It may be fear of change. It may be insecurity. Or it may be that they just really like their job and the company the way it is. In these moments, help people understand the necessity of a management layer—the team has just gotten too big, we need to specialize, we need to prepare for more growth—then give them their options:</p><p>Stay an individual contributor but get layered under someone else. This is not necessarily a bad thing; their new manager could be a friend they’ve worked with for a long time at this company. Or you may be able to bring in an amazing leader from outside who they can learn from. But if they choose this option then they have to accept that they’ll be managed differently and won’t have as much influence over how the team evolves.
Do a management trial. Let them try out the role and see how they feel. Go on vacation and hand over the reins. Tell everyone that this person is in charge. Or start bringing them to management meetings with you—ask them to present. Ask them to lead larger and larger projects. Delegate some tasks to them, let them see what the job is really about. Have them help with HR details. Bring them into planning meetings.
Then ask the candidate if they’d like a real trial run. Send them to manager training. If your company is too small to have proper training, then assign them an experienced manager as a coach (this should be formalized and one of the coach’s Objectives and Key Results or OKRs for the quarter. It should be a key goal rather than a hand-wavy “Help this person out, would you?”).</p><p>Then go to the rest of the team in 1:1s and mention that you’re thinking of promoting this person, but you want to make sure everyone is comfortable first. Say, “Let’s give it a try. If you have any issues, come to me.” Start getting everyone used to the idea and give the candidate time to shine.</p><p>Then give them the option to make it real after they’ve gained some confidence in their abilities and the team feels comfortable with them in a new role.</p><p>Just start doing manager training early and make sure they have other experienced managers to talk to. Get them interested in the craft and science of being a good manager and explain that one of the critical parts of management is helping the team come up with creative solutions to difficult problems. You may not be doing all the work yourself, but you’ll be a vital part of making it great.</p><p>I’ve seen a lot of people with nascent leadership talent rise to the occasion. But you should know that some won’t level up. Some people will implode. Some will quit. Some will hate the job. Some will just be mediocre. In those moments, it’s your responsibility to help them find other opportunities—within the company or outside it. They tried something and failed, and that means they learned. That’s okay. Life is the process of elimination and now they’re free to try something new.</p><p>GOING FROM A MANAGER OF ICS TO A MANAGER OF MANAGERS</p><p>At around 120 people, you need directors: managers who manage other managers. Directors need to think more like a CEO than an individual contributor.</p><p>They have to put a lot more trust in the team below them—delegate more responsibilities—while taking on the role of coach. They’re close to the team but further from the product, responsible for big strategic swings but not entirely independent. And at the end of the day, they still need to deliver.</p><p>So these new directors shouldn’t just be dumped into the job with no support. They should be trained and assigned coaches from the outset. Maybe that’s you, maybe it’s someone else, but formalize the relationship. Help the new director realize that nobody expects them to know everything right away.</p><p>MEETINGS</p><p>The first thing most people complain about when companies grow fast is the sudden crush of meetings (and emails and messages; but mostly meetings). Team meetings, management meetings, all-hands meetings, HR meetings. To a certain extent there’s no avoiding them—people have to talk to each other and group chats can only get so big before they become counterproductive. You need meetings—in person or otherwise.</p><p>But you also need to occasionally stop and reevaluate your meetings and communications processes and change things up when they’re no longer an effective or efficient use of time. You might turn some meetings into status update reports and reduce the number of people who attend. But then you have to be wary of too many reports—you don’t want the teams spending tons of time releasing information that nobody reads. It’s a constant battle. Managers should always be paying attention to how many hours teams are sitting in meetings—both intra-team and inter-team—and working to keep those numbers under control.</p><p>All-hands meetings are a great example. These are meetings that everyone in the company attends. In the beginning, when you have fewer than 40–50 people, they probably happen weekly or every other week. They start out as informal and super-tactical gatherings. For the next hour we’re going to sit on the floor, share some lemon bars, discuss what everyone needs to know this week to do their jobs, address the next milestone, talk about what fun stuff we’re doing, and check out the competition. Sometimes, if necessary, you deliver hard news. But usually you’re looking forward—you talk about the mission and your progress toward it, then there’s a bit of team building at the end.</p><p>But as more people join the team, it’s impossible to make the meeting highly relevant for every person who attends and cover all the topics you want to cover. So you start to have all-hands meetings less frequently. And the content starts to change—it becomes less about what’s happening right now and more about the larger vision for the company and the big swings that are being planned.</p><p>The fun, weekly, interrupt-each-other, sit on the floor covered in crumbs all-hands doesn’t scale.</p><p>And if you don’t recognize that, you get trapped. Like Google. Up until very recently, all 140,000 people at Google attended a 2–3 hour all-hands meeting every week—the famous (or infamous) TGIF meeting. TGIF is short for “Thank God it’s Friday” but it actually happened on Thursdays since Asia needed to attend (another example of something that doesn’t scale).</p><p>Aside from a bit of banter from the execs, most of TGIF was dedicated to teams from across the company presenting their work. Sometimes the content was really interesting. Many times it wasn’t. But the purpose of the meeting—transmitting relevant information in an effective manner—was buried years ago. Most Googlers spent the entire three hours making memes about the meeting in an internal app called Memegen. And while that’s great for culture and a nice way of uniting the team, there’s no human on Earth who can claim it’s efficient or will help anyone do their job better.</p><p>And it’s expensive. Even if you don’t factor in the cost of a large chunk of your company spending several hours a week making memes, there’s so much prep work involved. Google had a dedicated team for TGIF—dozens of people spent hundreds of hours on these weekly productions.</p><p>So save the all-hands for when you really need them—make them special. Keep them regular but rare. And encourage smaller, inter-team groups to get together to share relevant information. They can even sit on the floor eating lemon bars. But the goals of the meetings should be crisp and clean, and the time people spend at work should have a purpose.</p><p>HUMAN RESOURCES/PEOPLE</p><p>In the beginning, you don’t really need HR. When you’re five, ten, even fifty people, you can just use an external recruiter to grow the team, talk to each other when issues come up, and outsource the basics—health care, 401(k)s, etc.</p><p>But when you hit 60–80 employees, you need to bring HR in-house. Because you’re not just dealing with 60–80 people. It’s actually 240. Or 320. Most employees come with a family—spouses, partners, dependents. And each of those people will have some need that falls on your shoulders; they’ll get sick or pregnant or need braces or want to take a leave of absence or just have questions about benefits.</p><p>It will get more and more expensive to outsource HR and will absorb way, way too much of your time.</p><p>So bring it in-house and remind employees that HR is there to protect them and the culture. To help them if they have a kid. To ensure they get paid on time. To make sure they feel safe. Adding a formal HR function doesn’t take anything away—it just gives them and their families a better resource.</p><p>COACHES/MENTORS</p><p>Coaching and mentorship is critical before breakpoints. Especially at the transition to 30–40 people, when managers emerge, and around 80–120, when you promote people to director.</p><p>Just remember there’s a difference between coaches and mentors:</p><p>Coaches are there to help with the business. It’s all about the work: this company, this job, this moment in time.</p><p>Mentors are more personal. They don’t just help with people’s jobs, they help with their lives, their families.</p><p>A coach helps because they know the company; a mentor helps because they know you.</p><p>The best is a combination of the two—someone who understands both worlds—a mentor/coach who can help people see the bigger picture about what the business may need as well as what they need personally.</p><p>In the early days, if you’re the leader, you’re the mentor. You prepare people for the big transition and coach them through it. But as the team grows, you’ll need to bring in formal mentors or coaches to help with some of the load. At 120 people, you should have executive coaches who can be there to guide your leadership team through their new responsibilities as well as communication and organizational strategies.</p><p>CULTURE</p><p>Culture is the hardest thing to pinpoint and the hardest to preserve. Even in small companies, each team typically evolves its own distinctive culture. And when a treasured part of that culture disappears, it can take a lot of your employees with it.</p><p>So to preserve what you love, have your team write down the things they value most and build a plan to continue them. And remember it’s not necessarily the obvious stuff that binds people to your company—it can be small things, silly things. At Nest a few members of the team started doing barbecues in the parking lot when we were really small. They were nice—everyone would relax and talk and eat. As we grew, those barbecues could have easily petered out—steak for fifteen people is very different from steak for fifty. Or five hundred. So we invested in them as a business. They became bigger and more elaborate and more expensive, but we refused to let them die. It was vital for our culture that everyone had the opportunity to just hang out—execs and employees, design and engineers, QA and IT and support. It was just a barbecue, but it was important. And it scaled a lot better than all-hands meetings.</p><p>Culture arises organically but then needs to be codified to be maintained.</p><p>So write down your company values and post them on your physical and virtual walls. Share them with new employees. Make them part of every interview with new candidates. Everyone should know what matters at your company—what defines your culture. If you don’t explicitly know your values, you can’t pass them on, maintain them, evolve them, or hire for them.</p><p>And make every team write down how they do things: What’s the marketing process? What’s the engineering process? What are the phases for how we make a product? How do we work together? It can’t just be left in people’s brains. People leave. New people join. If you’re growing geometrically—in all directions at once—then you need a strong, stable core at the center. Your experienced employees have to be able to walk new employees through how you do what you do, or else everyone gets lost.</p><p>I’ve watched these breakpoints crack hundreds of companies we’ve invested in and I’ve experienced them in my own life—when I tried to grow a new group at Philips amid a sea of nearly 300,000 employees, when Apple went from 3,000 people to 80,000. And breakpoints always seem to catch people off-guard. Nobody wants to take their eyes off their booming business and thriving vision and new products to pause and consider and restructure.</p><p>Planning for a breakpoint is a lot to deal with on top of everything else going on. And it’s the worst kind of planning: messy, difficult, infinitely annoying people stuff. It’s always tempting to leave it for another day.</p><p>But “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” doesn’t work here. When you don’t prepare for breakpoints—don’t warn the team, don’t thoughtfully restructure the org around roles first and individuals second, don’t add new managers, don’t reassess your meetings and communication tools, don’t give people access to training or coaches, don’t actively work to preserve your culture—then the consequences are clear:</p><p>In their quest to keep people happy, I’ve seen leaders build their org around existing employees instead of first figuring out what the optimal structure should be and fitting their team into those roles.
Then roles and responsibilities overlap, there’s a ton of redundancy in the upper levels, they have to invent weird new titles for people, and nobody knows what they should be working on.
Work slows to a crawl.
Employees complain that the culture is dead.
People start to quit.
Panic sets in and it can feel like a full-blown crisis.
It usually takes six to nine months to recover. Generally companies have to trim off all the new growth beyond the breakpoint and start over again and do it right. But you have to do it right. Businesses that try to ignore breakpoints either don’t survive or get stuck at their current size and stagnate.</p><p>And you should know that even if you do manage everything perfectly, you’ll probably still lose some employees. Good people will quit. Some will just prefer smaller companies. Some won’t like the changes, even if they respect the need for them. Some will resent getting layered, despite plenty of warning and coaching. But even if it hurts to watch trusted teammates and friends leave, the losses will be manageable. It won’t be a disaster. Your culture and company will survive.</p><p>And eventually, once you’ve reassured your employees, trained the managers, had a million 1:1s to talk through people’s anxieties, codified your values and processes, and made speeches at your regular (but not too frequent) all-hands to help build and strengthen the culture, you’ll have to take a minute and think about yourself.</p><p>You’re probably also scared. And you should be. If not, you aren’t taking it seriously enough.</p><p>Breakpoints don’t just happen to the company. They happen to you. As a CEO or founder or leader of a team in a larger company, the bigger your organization grows, the more isolated you become and the further the product retreats from you. When you first started, you helped hire everyone, knew everyone, were in many if not all the meetings, were side by side with your team, building together. As the team grew past 120–150, everything changed. You started seeing faces you didn’t recognize—are these people our employees? Partners? Friends who came for lunch? You don’t know all the nitty-gritty details of what’s going on anymore. And you can’t just walk into a meeting without freaking everyone out. Why is the CEO here? What’s wrong?</p><p>So when breakpoints come for you, remember how you’ve been reassuring the team and take your own advice: know they’re coming and get ready. Talk to your mentor. Understand what your job should look like well before every transition and plan for it. And always remember that change is growth and growth is opportunity. Your company is an organism; its cells need to divide to multiply, they need to differentiate to become something new. Don’t worry about what you’re going to lose—think about what you’re going to become.</p><p>Chapter 5.3
Design for Everyone
Everything that needs to be created needs to be designed—not just products and marketing, but processes, experiences, organizations, forms, materials. At its core, designing simply means thinking through a problem and finding an elegant solution. Anyone can do that. Everyone should.</p><p>Being a good designer is more a way of thinking than a way of drawing. It’s not just about making things pretty—it’s about making them work better. You may not be able to create a perfectly polished prototype without a professional designer, but you can get pretty damn far on your own if you follow two core principles:</p><ol><li>Deploy design thinking: This is a well-known strategy originated by IDEO’s David Kelley that encourages you to identify your customer and their pain points, deeply understand the problem you’re trying to solve, and systematically uncover ways to solve it. <!-- -->[See also: Reading List: Creative Confidence: Unleashing the Creative Potential Within Us All.]</li></ol><p>For example, a person complains that they have too many TV remotes. Instead of immediately jumping in and combining all the remotes into one giant, ridiculously complicated remote, you should take time to understand your customer: What do they do when they sit down on the couch? What are they watching? When are they watching? Who’s watching with them? What do they use each remote for and how often? Where do they keep them? What happens when they grab the wrong one?</p><p>From there, you come to understand your customer’s actual problem: they get home late and don’t want to switch on a bunch of lights and wake their family, so they try to turn on the TV in the dark and can never find the right remote. Okay—we can find a solution for that.</p><ol start="2"><li>Avoid habituation: Everyone gets used to things. Life is full of tiny and enormous inconveniences that you no longer notice because your brain has simply accepted them as unchangeable reality and filtered them out.</li></ol><p>For example, think about the little sticker that grocery stores put on produce. Instead of just eating an apple, you now have to find the sticker, peel it off, and scrape the gluey residue off with a fingernail. The first few times you encountered the sticker, you were probably annoyed. By now you barely register it.</p><p>But when you think like a designer, you stay awake to the many things in your work and life that can be better. You find opportunities to improve experiences that people long ago assumed would just always be terrible.*</p><hr><p>Vocabulary gets in the way sometimes.</p><p>Design is not just a profession.</p><p>A customer is not only a person who buys something.</p><p>A product is not just a physical object or software that you sell.</p><p>You can employ design thinking for everything you do.</p><p>Imagine you’re looking through your closet, getting ready for a job interview: your customer is your interviewer, your product is yourself, and you’re designing your outfit for the day. Should you wear jeans? A button-down? Is the company culture formal or informal? What do you want to project about yourself? Making that decision is a design process. Getting to the best outcome requires design thinking, even if it’s unconscious.</p><p>Now you get the job. Congratulations. The jeans were a good call. But the office is ten miles away and you don’t have a car. Welcome to today’s design process—only now the customer is yourself.</p><p>You probably won’t just run out and buy a random car—you’ll think through your options. Do you actually need a car? Maybe you can take the bus or get a scooter or a bike. If you do get a car, what are all the things you’ll use it for? What’s your budget? Should you get a hybrid or electric car? Will you be sitting in traffic? Will you park on the street or in a garage? Will you be driving family or friends or coworkers or pets? Will you take road trips on weekends?</p><p>Design thinking forces you to really understand the problem you’re trying to solve. In this case, the problem isn’t “I need a car to get to work.” It’s actually much broader: “How do I want to get around?” The product you’re designing is a mobility strategy for your life.</p><p>Literally the only way to make a really good product is to dig in, analyze your customer’s needs, and explore all the possible options (including the unexpected ones: maybe I can work from home, maybe I can move closer to work). There are no perfect designs. There are always constraints. But you choose the best of all the options—aesthetically, functionally, and at the necessary price point.</p><p>That’s a design process. That’s how I designed the iPod. That’s how I design everything.</p><p>And that’s what some people think is impossible for “nondesigners.” <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 2.3: Assholes.]</p><p>I’ve collaborated with many designers over the years—some of them brilliant, amazing talents—but I’ve also come to blows with high-minded design leaders who firmly believe that design is only for designers. They think that, when faced with a tough challenge, you always need an expert to swoop in. Someone—preferably them—with a refined aesthetic sense and an impressive degree. I’ve watched these designers dismiss ideas that came from engineering or manufacturing based entirely on the preconception that nondesigners can’t be trusted to understand customers’ needs and find thoughtful solutions. If they don’t come up with it then it’s not a solution at all.</p><p>It drives me completely insane.</p><p>Especially because that way of thinking is infectious. I come across tons of startups that encounter a difficult design challenge and immediately think they have to hire someone else to solve it. We don’t know enough, we don’t have the expertise, we need someone to do this for us.</p><p>But you shouldn’t outsource a problem before you try to solve it yourself, especially if solving that problem is core to the future of your business. If it’s a critical function, your team needs to build the muscle to understand the process and do it themselves.</p><p>In the early days of Nest it was clear that marketing was going to be a major differentiator for us. So when I first hired Anton Oenning to lead marketing, I asked him to get to work on the packaging. Anton is a wonderfully intuitive and empathetic marketer, master storyteller, and champion of the customer experience, but he’s not a designer. Nor a copywriter. Here’s how he remembers it:</p><p>“In, like, week two at Nest, Tony told me to design the packaging and write the copy. ‘What? Uh. Sure. Let me call some freelance designers and copywriters I’ve worked with.’ ‘No. Has to stay in-house, under wraps.’ ‘Ah. Huhuh. Okay. I’ll get right on that.’ And it turned out to be the most liberating request of, I think, my entire career.”</p><p>He learned by doing. And failing. And trying again. We rewrote the packaging more than ten times and developed a messaging process and framework at the same time. <!-- -->[See also: Figure 5.4.1, in Chapter 5.4.]<!-- --> And then, after he’d built a foundational understanding of what the packaging could be and its innate limitations, after he knew the messaging in his bones, he worked with designers and copywriters to make it perfect. But none of that could have happened if he hadn’t tried it himself first. He just needed a push. Usually that’s all anyone who’s smart and capable really needs to shine.</p><p>You may not even need anyone to draw or make aesthetic choices. For example, take naming. It’s an issue all businesses face. But rather than calling in a naming or branding agency to pick a name for you, sit down and approach the problem like a designer:</p><p>Who is your customer and where will they encounter this name?</p><p>What are you trying to get your customer to think or feel about your product?</p><p>What brand attributes or product features are most important to highlight with this name?</p><p>Is this product part of a family of products or is it stand-alone?</p><p>What will the next version be called?</p><p>Should the name be evocative of a feeling or idea or a straightforward description?</p><p>Once you come up with a list, begin to use the names in context.</p><p>How does it work in a sentence?</p><p>How do you use it in print?</p><p>How do you use it graphically?</p><p>You may not come up with a name you love, but trying it yourself will allow you to, at the very least, appreciate and understand the naming process. It will give you the tools you need to work with an agency and learn from the tricks they use to reach a final suggestion.</p><p>Sometimes you really do need to hire an expert. Sometimes a brilliant designer can build you a ladder and help your team out of the hole they’ve dug for themselves. But the whole time, your team should be watching and learning and asking questions so they can make their own ladders in the future.</p><p>That’s how people at all levels, on every team can begin to use design thinking in their daily work—for packaging, devices, UI, website, marketing, ordering, auditory, visual, touch, smell. They’ll begin to thoughtfully design everything from the process your company uses to pay its bills to how a customer can return your product.</p><p>Across the board, your team will begin to notice the holes they’re standing in, shake off their habituation to the status quo, and start making things better. Rather than looking at how other companies do things—have always done things—and copying them, your team will begin to think like their customer: “Here’s how I would want to return this product.” Then they’ll design the process from scratch, the way it should be designed:</p><p>Ask why at every step—why is it like this now? How can it be better?
Think like a user who has never tried this product before; dig into their mindset, their pain and challenges, their hopes and desires.
Break it down into steps and set all the constraints up front. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 3.5: Heartbeats and Handcuffs.]<!-- -->
Understand and tell the story of the product. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 3.2: Why Storytelling.]<!-- -->
Create prototypes all along the way. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 3.1: Make the Intangible Tangible.]<!-- -->
Not everyone can be a great designer, but everyone can think like one. Designing isn’t something in your DNA that you’re simply born with—it’s something you learn. You can bring in coaches and teachers, classes and books to help get everyone into the right mindset. You can do it together.</p><p>Even the greatest designers in the world can’t do it alone. Most people look at Apple design and say: this is the work of Steve Jobs. This is the work of Jony Ive. But that’s not remotely true. It’s never just one or two people pouring out their genius into a sketchbook, then handing it to some lowly employees to execute. Thousands upon thousands of people design for Apple—and it’s those teams that come together and create something truly unique and wonderful.</p><p>To be a great designer you can’t lock yourself in a room—you have to connect with your team, with your customer and their environment, and other teams who may have innovative ideas to bring to the table. You have to understand your customer’s needs and all the different ways you can address them. You have to look at a problem from all angles. You have to get a little creative. And you have to notice the problem in the first place.</p><p>That last point doesn’t sound like a big deal. But it’s huge. It’s the difference between a startup employee and its founder.</p><p>Most people are so habituated to the problems in their home lives or work that they no longer realize they’re problems. They simply go about their day, get into bed, close their eyes, realize they left the lights on in the kitchen, groan and grump down the stairs, without ever thinking: Why is there no light switch in my bedroom that turns off all the lights in the house?</p><p>You can’t solve interesting problems if you don’t notice they’re there.</p><p>Here’s the reason I thought the iPod could really succeed: because CDs were heavy. I love music and my CD collection in those days numbered in the hundreds. Each CD was carefully packaged in its plastic sleeve, nestled beside fifty of its closest friends in one of my carrying cases. I’d DJ on weekends—just for fun at parties—and the CDs weighed more than my speakers.</p><p>Pretty much everyone in the nineties dragged their CDs with them. Pretty much everyone had a beat-up leather case that lived in their car because it was too bulky for their bag. But pretty much nobody thought about it as a problem with a solution. Everyone just assumed it was part of life—if you wanted to listen to your music, you’d need to bring your CDs.</p><p>The people who notice the problems around them—and then dream up solutions—are mostly inventors, startup founders, and kids. Young people look at the world and question it. They’re not worn down by doing the same stupid thing a thousand times—they don’t assume everything has to be the way it is. They ask “why?”</p><p>Keeping your brain young is key. Seeing problems that are glossed over by others is useful. Coming up with solutions to those problems, using the vocabulary and thought process of a designer, is invaluable.</p><p>Steve Jobs called it “staying a beginner.” He was constantly telling us to look at what we were making with fresh eyes. We weren’t designing the iPod for ourselves—we were making it for people who had never experienced digital music. People with boom boxes and Walkmen, with beat-up leather CD cases in their cars. We were trying to introduce them to a completely different way of thinking about their music. Every tiny detail mattered for those people—they could easily get stuck, frustrated when faced with something so completely new. It needed to be smooth. It needed to feel magical.</p><p>Steve wanted people to take this beautiful little object out of the box and instantly love and understand it.</p><p>But of course that was impossible. Nothing was instant. Back then all consumer electronics with a hard drive needed to be charged before you could use them. You’d get a new gadget, take it out of the box, then you’d have to plug it in for an hour before you could turn it on. It was annoying, but it was life.</p><p>Then Steve said, “We’re not going to let that happen to our product.”</p><p>It was typical for electronics to run for thirty minutes in the factory to make sure they worked. We ran the iPod for more than two hours. The factory slowed down. Way down. The manufacturing team complained; costs added up. But that extra time not only let us test the iPod completely, it also gave the battery time to fully charge.</p><p>Now it’s de rigueur—all electronics come with a full battery. After Steve recognized the issue, so did everyone else.</p><p>It seems like a small thing, but it was meaningful. It mattered. You opened up the box and your iPod was there to meet you, ready to change your life.</p><p>Magic.</p><p>The kind of magic anyone can do.</p><p>You just have to notice the problem. And not wait around for someone to solve it for you.</p><p>Chapter 5.4
A Method to the Marketing
Marketing does not have to be soft and hand-wavy. While good marketing is anchored in human connection and empathy, creating and implementing your marketing programs can and should be a rigorous and analytical process.</p><ol><li><p>Marketing cannot just be figured out at the very end. When building a product, product management and the marketing team should be working together from the very beginning. As you build, you should continue to use marketing to evolve the story and ensure they have a voice in what the product becomes.</p></li><li><p>Use marketing to prototype your product narrative. The creative team can help you make the product narrative tangible. This should happen in parallel with product development—one should feed the other.</p></li><li><p>The product is the brand. The actual experience a customer has with your product will do far more to cement your brand in their heads than any advertising you can show them. Marketing is part of every customer touchpoint whether you realize it or not.</p></li><li><p>Nothing exists in a vacuum. You can’t just make an ad and think you’re done. The ad leads to a website that sends you to a store where you purchase a box that contains a guide that helps you with installation, after which you’re greeted by a welcome email. The entire experience has to be designed together, with different touchpoints explaining different parts of your messaging to create a consistent, cohesive experience.</p></li><li><p>The best marketing is just telling the truth. The ultimate job of marketing is to find the very best way to tell the true story of your product.</p></li></ol><hr><p>Many people think marketing is just the bit that comes at the very end of creating something—where people who had nothing to do with product development draw up a cute little ad. Like how Coca-Cola shows you happy polar bears to convince you to drink sugar water.</p><p>These are the same people who dismiss marketing as unnecessary fluff or a necessary evil. They think it’s about bullshitting people, stopping at nothing to take their money. Building the product is good and clean, but then to sell it you have to get a little dirty.</p><p>But good marketing isn’t bullshitting. It’s not about making something up, crafting a fiction, exaggerating your product’s benefits, and burying its faults.</p><p>Steve Jobs often said, “The best marketing is just telling the truth.”</p><p>If the messaging rings true, then the marketing is better. You don’t have to rely on bells and whistles, stunts, and dancing polar bears—you simply explain in the best way possible what you’re making and why you’re making it.</p><p>And you tell a story: you connect with people’s emotions so they’re drawn to your narrative, but you also appeal to their rational side so they can convince themselves it’s the smart move to buy what you’re selling. You balance what they want to hear with what they need to know. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 3.2: Why Storytelling.]</p><p>To make the story feel real, to make it tangible, you need to visualize it. You need a messaging architecture:</p><p>image
Fig. 5.4.1</p><p>This is the template we created at Nest that I’ve now passed along to endless startups. It’s been used for everything from medical diagnostic tools to sensors for shrimp farmers. Now we’re using it for this book.</p><p>Matteo Vianello</p><p>First you break down the pain points that your customer is feeling or has habituated away.</p><p>Each pain is a “why”—it gives your product a reason to exist.</p><p>The painkiller is the “how”—these are the features that will solve the customer’s problem.</p><p>The “I want it” column explains the emotions that your customers are feeling.</p><p>The “I need it” column covers the rational reasons to buy this product.</p><p>The whole product narrative should be in there—every pain, every painkiller, every rational and emotional impulse, every insight about your customer. It needs to encompass everything because:</p><p>It’s essential for product development: Product management and marketing work on the messaging architecture from day one. In order to build a great product, each pain has to be extremely well understood and answered with a painkiller in the form of a product feature. The messaging architecture is a sister text to the plain list of features and their functionality that makes up your basic product messaging. Both need to exist side by side: the what and the why.
It’s a living document: As the product and your team’s understanding of the customer evolve, so does the messaging architecture.
It’s a shared resource: Everyone who is responsible for any customer touchpoints should be looking at this document, not just marketing. It should steer engineering, sales, and support as well. Every single team should be thinking about the what, the why, and the story you’re telling.
But the messaging architecture is only the first step.</p><p>For every version of the Nest story, we wrote down the most common objections and how we’d overcome them—what stats to use, what pages of the website to send people to, what partnerships to mention or testimonials to point to. We figured out which story we could put on a billboard all the way down to the story we’d tell a longtime customer.</p><p>The process of convincing someone to buy and use your product needs to respect the customer, needs to understand their needs at different points of the user experience. You can’t just shout your top ten features at people in a billboard and a website and packaging just like you can’t simply hand someone your résumé at an interview, then lunch, then on a date. Sure, you’re giving them important information, but different moments in the journey require different approaches.</p><p>Your message needs to fit the customer’s context. You can’t say everything everywhere.</p><p>So when we were thinking about how the thermostat would reach customers, we laid out all the different ways people could discover our brand: advertising, word of mouth, social media, reviews, interviews, in-store displays, launch events.</p><p>Then we laid out the next step in the process—how they’d learn about our product. Brochures, our website, packaging, etc.</p><p>And then we created a messaging activation matrix.</p><p>When we were deciding what went where, it was crucial to know which parts of the story customers would be exposed to at various points of the journey.</p><p>Top-line billboards would just introduce the idea of a new kind of thermostat.
The packaging would highlight the top six features and how the product connects to your phone.
The website would emphasize energy savings and showcase how Nest fits into your daily life.
The usage guide inside the packaging would provide more detail about how to train the learning algorithm and tips for saving energy.
The support site would go deeper with exact instructions and thorough explanations of all the features.
image
Fig. 5.4.2</p><p>The messaging activation matrix should guide where and when you include certain information so you don’t overwhelm or undereducate your customer as they move through multiple touchpoints along the consumer journey.</p><p>Matteo Vianello</p><p>This is the point when messaging turned into marketing. When the facts we wanted people to understand became ads and videos and tweets. And this is when the lawyers stepped in.</p><p>The whole point of the creative team is to be creative, to come up with the most elegant and compelling version of the truth, to tell your story beautifully. But unchecked creativity can get you sued. You do not want to do it without a lawyer present.</p><p>A lot of small startups skip this step. They think they can stretch the truth and nobody will notice. But if you are successful, they always notice—especially the class-action lawyers. And even an innocent white lie in your marketing can taint everything you do when it’s exposed. You can instantly lose customer trust.</p><p>That’s why for a long time Nest couldn’t make any energy-savings claims in our marketing—the best we could do was write white papers to explain our simulation models and link to them from our website. Eventually we got more and more real customer data that proved our simulations were right—the thermostat saved energy.</p><p>But even if something is true, that doesn’t necessarily mean you can just say it.</p><p>When the creative team wrote “The Nest Learning Thermostat saves energy,” the legal team made it “can save.” When they wrote “Customers saved 20–50% on their energy bills,” legal brought out the red pen and changed it to “Typical users experienced up to 20% in energy savings.” And then creative rolled their eyes and came back with another option. They pushed and pulled and negotiated until together everyone found the words we needed. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 5.7: Lawyer Up: So to get the most out of your lawyer.]</p><p>And then they brought those words to me.</p><p>I approved everything we put out into the world. Especially in the beginning.</p><p>This wasn’t my area of expertise—I had watched Steve Jobs sell iPods and iPhones and work closely with marketing, but had never done it myself. So the only way I could master marketing was to bury myself in it—to take the customer journey myself, to touch every touchpoint. So nothing was ever presented to me without context—I would always expect to see what came before, what came after. I’d need to know the story we were telling and to whom we were telling it and at what point of the journey they were. An ad can’t be understood without knowing where it will appear and where it will lead to. A webpage can’t be approved until you know who will be routed to that page and what they’ll need to know and where the call to action will take them. Everything is connected to everything, so everything must be understood together.</p><p>It wasn’t micromanagement—it was care. I was putting the same amount of energy and time into the beginning of the customer journey as I put into the end. To those who aren’t used to it, that feels intense and unwarranted, but that was my job. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 6.1: Becoming CEO: So your job is to care.]<!-- --> I wanted the words and images that we used to describe our products to be as great as the products themselves. I wanted the entire experience to shine. I wanted the marketing team to be as exacting as the engineering and manufacturing teams—to learn from this rigor so they would begin to push themselves just as hard, or harder, than I pushed them.</p><p>I knew marketing was going to have to be one of our differentiators—something that lifted us beyond anything any other thermostat maker could dream of—so it was important to give it time and attention. And money.</p><p>The money is important. We were a small company with limited resources but we invested in marketing. We invested in creating beautiful things because we knew we’d amortize the hell out of them. We used every expensive, gorgeous photo in a thousand different places; we played every high-quality video everywhere we could. The team picked the elements that would have the most impact—that we could use and reuse for years—then spent the money to do them well.</p><p>Today, ten years later, Google Nest is still using some of the photos and assets we created before we even launched our company.</p><p>The reason is that marketing was part of the process from day one. Nobody was ignoring it, nobody was forgetting about it. We knew it was useful, so we used it.</p><p>This perspective and focus allowed us to do something somewhat unique to Nest: marketing prototyped the product narrative in parallel with product development.</p><p>The clearest expression of that was the Why We Made It page on nest.com.</p><p>image
Fig. 5.4.3</p><p>We literally took the “why” at the heart of thermostat product development and slapped it on the front page of our website. One of the first tabs on nest.com was called “Why we made it”—that’s where we connected directly with a skeptical audience, where we injected the virus of doubt. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 3.2: Why Storytelling.]<!-- --> We explained why people thought thermostats didn’t matter—why they were neglected and ignored—and then we told customers about the incredible impact they had on people’s homes, their bills, and the environment.</p><p>Matteo Vianello</p><p>The question of why we made it connected explicitly to why anyone should buy it. We had to get it right—for our customers and for ourselves.</p><p>It took weeks to get this page written. And as the product evolved, the page evolved alongside it. Marketing was always there, ensuring that we still had a strong answer to “Why We Made It” even as engineering and product management tweaked what we were making.</p><p>That allowed marketing to have a valuable voice in product development. Because any big change to the product would force a change to the story. It was marketing’s job to figure out if that change would break the packaging, the website—all our prototypes of the product narrative. If something broke, then it was marketing’s job to speak up. To talk to product management and engineering. To figure out if there was a way to make it work or if the change was untenable.</p><p>And the “Why We Made It” page was only one part of our prototype. It supplied the rational argument for why anyone should buy a Nest Learning Thermostat—because regular thermostats waste energy and wasting energy is bad for you and bad for the planet. But we needed to prototype the emotional argument as well—and for that the creative team made a video and a Living with Nest webpage that gloried in the beauty and simplicity of the product, that made it a covetable object, a piece of art on your wall to make your home better, more comfortable.</p><p>Each part of the website highlighted a different part of the product story. That forced us to know the story in our bones, to live and breathe it so we could pass it to others in the clearest, most honest way possible.</p><p>Finding the best, most honest expression of a product or feature is not easy. That’s why there’s an entire team devoted to it. Product management can create the messaging—the top features, the problem statement—but finding the best way to tell that story to customers is an art. It’s a science. It’s marketing.</p><p>Of course, that’s not to say we always got it right.</p><p>There was no successful model to copy for how to sell thermostats to people who had used them a million times but had never given them a second thought. We didn’t know what would connect and what wouldn’t, if people would laugh at a $250 thermostat that you had to install yourself or fall in love.</p><p>So we tried things. And we screwed up plenty. I screwed up a ton.</p><p>We launched expensive brand-only ad campaigns before anyone knew our products. We made webpages so information-dense that almost nobody read them. And the customers in our imaginations weren’t the customers who showed up to buy our products. They were all different, needed different things, expected different things, skimmed our laboriously written treatises in half a second and dug deep on things that never occurred to us.</p><p>But screwing it up is how we got better. It’s how we learned. Brand ads made our egos feel better but they didn’t drive sales (you have to make great products for years before customers will buy a product simply because of your brand). The website needed to be short and sweet and fit product info into the context of people’s daily lives. Our support site needed to be more searchable because people didn’t follow the paths we laid out for them.</p><p>With every piece of marketing we made, we got better at marketing. I got better at marketing. The entire company got better at marketing. The messaging architecture and activation matrix turned a soft art into a hard science that everyone could understand. And when everyone can understand it, they can understand how important it is.</p><p>Chapter 5.5
The Point of PMs
The majority of companies I work with misunderstand the role of the product manager—if they even know it exists. They think it’s marketing (nope), it’s project management (nope), it’s press relations/communications (nope), it’s design (nope), product finance (nope), it’s the founder or CEO’s job (not really). The confusion mostly stems from the fact that product management lives at the intersection of many specialties and can look very different at different companies. But it’s also because of the stupid abbreviation. A PM can refer to:</p><p>Product manager or product marketing manager—Product marketing and product management are essentially the same thing—or at least they should be. A product manager’s responsibility is to figure out what the product should do and then create the spec (the description of how it will work) as well as the messaging (the facts you want customers to understand). Then they work with almost every part of the business (engineering, design, customer support, finance, sales, marketing, etc.) to get the product spec’d, built, and brought to market. They ensure that it stays true to its original intent and doesn’t get watered down along the way. But, most importantly, product managers are the voice of the customer. They keep every team in check to make sure they don’t lose sight of the ultimate goal—happy, satisfied customers.</p><p>Project manager—Coordinates tasks, meetings, calendars, and assets to enable individual projects to get done on time. It’s important to note that project managers are more than just glorified note takers. If the product manager is the voice of the product, the project manager is the voice of the project—their job is to alert the team to potential problems that could stall or derail the project and to help find solutions.</p><p>Program manager—Supervises groups of projects and project managers, focusing on both long-term business objectives and short-term deliverables.</p><p>To complicate matters further, some companies use different titles for product managers. Microsoft, for example, calls them program managers. There are also jobs that are adjacent to product management but not quite the same, especially in the world outside technology. CPGs (consumer product groups) like Colgate-Palmolive employ brand managers who don’t write the spec for the product, but are still the voice of the customer and responsible for shaping what the product will become.</p><p>In the interest of eliminating the confusion around what PM stands for, let’s use the following abbreviations:</p><p>PdM = Product manager</p><p>PjM = Project manager</p><p>PgM = Program manager</p><hr><p>When yet another CEO tells me they have no idea what a product manager does, it always makes me think of design in the eighties.</p><p>Because most tech companies in the eighties didn’t have designers.</p><p>Things were obviously designed and those designs were just as critical as they are today, but nobody employed designers to architect the user experience. Designing meant making something look nice, and that just happened as you developed the product—a mechanical engineer would draw something up, or if you wanted to get fancy, you’d outsource those drawings to an agency.</p><p>There was no school for design. No formal training. And any designers who managed to get hired were second-class citizens. They didn’t have the authority to push back on engineers who’d cut corners with a shrug and say, “Well, we got most of what the designer asked for. But we can’t do it all—too much time, too expensive. Ship it as is!”</p><p>And then Apple, Frog, David Kelley, IDEO, and design-led thinking came along in the nineties and elevated design. Designers stopped reporting to engineering. Design schools were founded. The profession came into its own as a formal discipline—understood, respected.</p><p>Product management is on that path now. But unfortunately we’re not there yet.</p><p>It’s only in the last five to ten years, since the advent of the iPhone and the app economy, that certain companies have begun to really understand product management and appreciate its value. Many still don’t.</p><p>It’s an issue I see at a lot of startups and project teams at larger companies—the founder or team lead often plays the role of the product manager in the beginning. They define the vision and work with all parts of the business to make it a reality. The trouble comes when the team grows—to 40, 50, 100 people. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 5.2: Breakpoints.]<!-- --> That’s when the leader has to step away from the day-to-day business of building the product and hand over the reins to someone else.</p><p>But they can’t imagine handing over their baby. How could anyone understand it or love it or help it grow as well as they could? And how would that function even work? Where would it live? How could the founder retain influence over the product if they’re no longer the manager of that product? And then what would the founder’s job even be? <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 6.1: Becoming CEO.]</p><p>The same thing happens at big companies. They’re also flummoxed. The engineers figure out what to build or the sales team tells them what customers need. Where does product management fit in?</p><p>As we write this in 2021, Google has moved to give product managers more power for the first time. Google has always been technology and engineering-led, but now Search is being rearranged to favor product managers over engineers. It’s a huge move and a dramatic cultural shift.</p><p>And the reason for it is simple: the customer needs a voice on the team. Engineers like to build products using the coolest new technology. Sales wants to build products that will make them a lot of money. But the product manager’s sole focus and responsibility is to build the right products for their customers.</p><p>That’s the job.</p><p>The tricky thing is that the responsibilities of a product manager are completely different at different companies. Product management is less a well-defined role and more a set of skills. It lives between everything, a white space that morphs based on the customer, the needs of the business, and the abilities of the humans involved.</p><p>A good product manager will do a little of everything and a great deal of all this:</p><p>Spec out what the product should do and the road map for where it will go over time.
Determine and maintain the messaging matrix.
Work with engineering to get the product built according to spec.
Work with design to make it intuitive and attractive to the target customer.
Work with marketing to help them understand the technical nuances in order to develop effective creative to communicate the messaging.
Present the product to management and get feedback from the execs.
Work with sales and finance to make sure this product has a market and can eventually make money.
Work with customer support to write necessary instructions, help manage problems, and take in customer requests and complaints.
Work with PR to address public perceptions, write the mock press release, and often act as a spokesperson.
And then there’s the even less well-defined stuff. Product managers look for places where the customer is unhappy. They unravel issues as they go, discovering the root of the problem and working with the team to solve it. They do whatever is necessary to move projects forward—that could be taking notes in meetings or triaging bugs or summarizing customer feedback or organizing team docs or sitting down with designers and sketching something out or meeting with engineering and digging into the code. It’s different for every product.</p><p>Sometimes product managers need to be extremely technical—usually in B2B settings where the user of the product is extremely technical, too. If you’re selling brake systems to a car company, you’d better really understand brakes. Having a deep well of knowledge about brakes is the only way you’ll connect with your customer and understand what they care about.</p><p>But if you’re building a car for a regular person, you don’t need to know every detail about how the brakes work. You just need to know enough to communicate with the engineers who build them. And then you need to decide if those brakes are an important part of the marketing story you tell customers.</p><p>Most tech companies break out product management and product marketing into two separate roles: Product management defines the product and gets it built. Product marketing writes the messaging—the facts you want to communicate to customers—and gets the product sold.</p><p>But from my experience that’s a grievous mistake. Those are, and should always be, one job. There should be no separation between what the product will be and how it will be explained—the story has to be utterly cohesive from the beginning.</p><p>Your messaging is your product. The story you’re telling shapes the thing you’re making. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 3.2: Why Storytelling.]</p><p>I learned storytelling from Steve Jobs.</p><p>I learned product management from Greg Joswiak.</p><p>Joz, a fellow Wolverine, Michigander, and overall great person, has been at Apple since he left Ann Arbor in 1986 and has run product marketing for decades. And his superpower—the superpower of every truly great product manager—is empathy.</p><p>He doesn’t just understand the customer. He becomes the customer. He can shake off his deep, geeky knowledge of the product and use it like a beginner, like a regular person. You’d be surprised how many product managers skip that hugely necessary step—listening to their customers, gaining insights, empathizing with their needs, then actually using the product in the real world. But for Joz, it’s the only way.</p><p>So when Joz stepped into the world with his next-gen iPod to test it out, he fiddled with it like a beginner. He set aside all the tech specs—except one: battery life.</p><p>Nobody wanted their iPod to die in the middle of a flight or as they were DJing a party or going for a run. But as the product evolved from the classic iPod to the iPod Nano, we were in a constant tug-of-war—the smaller and more elegant it became, the less room there was for a battery. But what’s the point of a thousand songs in your pocket if you have to keep taking them out of your pocket to recharge?</p><p>One charge had to last days, not hours.</p><p>Battery life mattered to customers. And it mattered to Steve Jobs. You couldn’t just come to Steve and say, “The next version of the iPod is going to have a twelve-hour battery instead of fifteen like the last version.” You’d get thrown out of the meeting.</p><p>So Joz and I didn’t bring Steve numbers—we brought him customers. Commuters like Sarah only use the iPod going to and from work, students like Tom use it throughout the day, but in short bursts between classes or basketball games.</p><p>We created typical customer personas, then walked through the moments in their life when they used their iPods—while jogging, at parties, in the car. And we showed Steve that even if the number engineering gave us was twelve hours, those twelve hours actually lasted most people all week long.</p><p>The numbers were empty without customers, the facts meaningless without context.</p><p>Joz always, always understood the context and was able to turn it into an effective narrative. It’s how we were able to convince Steve. And reporters. And customers. It’s how we could sell iPods.</p><p>And that’s why product management has to own the messaging. The spec shows the features, the details of how a product will work, but the messaging predicts people’s concerns and finds ways to mitigate them. It answers the question, “Why will customers care?” And that question has to be answered long before anyone gets to work.</p><p>Figuring out what should be built and why is the hardest part of building. And it’s impossible to do it alone. Product management can’t just throw a spec over the fence to the rest of the team—every part of the business should be involved. That doesn’t mean the product manager should build by consensus, but engineering, marketing, finance, sales, customer support, and legal will all have ideas and useful insights that will help shape the narrative before the product is built. And they’ll continue to improve that narrative as the product evolves.</p><p>A spec and messaging aren’t instructions that are set in stone. They flex and change, shifting as new ideas are introduced, or new realities slap you in the face. Building a product isn’t like assembling an IKEA chair. You can’t just hand people instructions and walk away.</p><p>Building a product is like making a song.</p><p>The band is composed of marketing, sales, engineering, support, manufacturing, PR, legal. And the product manager is the producer—making sure everyone knows the melody, that nobody is out of tune and everyone is doing their part. They’re the only person who can see and hear how all the pieces are coming together, so they can tell when there’s too much bassoon or when a drum solo’s going on too long, when features get out of whack or people get so caught up in their own project that they forget the big picture.</p><p>But they’re also not directing everything. Their job isn’t to be CEO of the product—or, God forbid, what some companies call the “product owner.” They can’t single-handedly dictate what will and will not make it in. Sometimes they’ll have the final opinion, sometimes they’ll have to say “no,” sometimes they’ll have to direct from the front. But that should be rare. Mostly they empower the team. They help everyone understand the context of what the customer needs, then work together to make the right choices. If a product manager is making all the decisions, then they are not a good product manager.</p><p>It’s the contributions of everyone on the team that ultimately define the melody, that turn noise into a song.</p><p>But of course it doesn’t always flow beautifully.</p><p>The engineers may want more say in what they’re building—they may claim the product manager isn’t technical enough or simply that engineering knows best. The marketers rarely want to stick to the playbook—they want to stretch and be creative, using words or images that may unintentionally misrepresent the product. People won’t always get along. Opinion-driven decisions will be debated ad nauseam. Teams will get out of step, individuals will get angry, the product will get pulled in opposite directions.</p><p>So the product manager has to be a master negotiator and communicator. They have to influence people without managing them. They have to ask questions and listen and use their superpower—empathy for the customer, empathy for the team—to build bridges and mend road maps. They have to escalate if someone needs to play bad cop, but know they can’t play that card too often. They have to know what to fight for and which battles should be saved for another day. They have to pop up in meetings all over the company where teams are representing their own interests—their schedules, their needs, their issues—and stand alone, advocating for the customer.</p><p>They have to tell the story of the customer, make sure everyone feels it. And that’s how they move the needle.</p><p>The other day I was talking to Sophie Le Guen, an incredibly sharp and empathetic product manager at Nest.</p><p>She told me about a very early meeting she had with the engineering team to discuss the “why” for the new Nest Secure security system. For the mostly male engineering team, the “why” was simple: I want a security system to protect my home when I’m away.</p><p>But Sophie had been interviewing people and noticed that while men usually focused on empty homes, women focused on full ones. When they were alone or alone with the kids, women wanted extra protection. Especially at night.</p><p>Sophie’s job was to tell their story—to help a single engineer who lived alone understand a parent’s perspective. And then her job was to turn that perspective into features that worked for the entire family—a family that wanted to be safe, to turn on the security system when they walked in the door—but who didn’t want to feel like prisoners in their own home. So when Nest Secure launched, the motion sensors had a single button. A homeowner (or their kid) could push the button and open a door or window from the inside without having to deactivate the whole security system or cause a blaring false alarm.</p><p>The customer story helped engineering understand the pain point. They built a product to address that pain. Then marketing crafted a narrative that gave every person who had experienced the pain a reason to buy the product.</p><p>The thread that tied all these people and teams and pains and desires together was product management. For every successful product and company, all parts of your business end up leading back to them—it’s all hinged together in one central point.</p><p>This is why product managers are the hardest people to hire and train. It’s why the great ones are so valuable and so beloved. Because they have to understand it all, make sense of it. And they do it alone. They’re one of the most important teams at a company and one of the smallest.</p><p>Because the needs of each product and company are so different, these are incredibly difficult jobs to describe (See also: the previous three thousand words), never mind actually hire for. There’s no set job description or even a proper set of requirements. Many people assume product managers have to be technical, but that’s absolutely not true. Especially in B2C companies. I’ve met many great product managers who are able to build trust and a rapport with engineering without any kind of technical background. As long as they have a solid basic understanding of the technology and the curiosity to learn more, they can figure out how to work with engineering to get it built.</p><p>There’s no four-year college degree for product management, no obvious source you can hire from. Amazing product managers usually emerge from other roles. They start in marketing or engineering or support, but because they care so deeply about the customer, they start fixing the product and working to redefine it, rather than just executing someone else’s spec or messaging. And their focus on the customer doesn’t cloud their understanding that ultimately this is a business—so they also dive into sales and ops, try to understand unit economics and pricing.</p><p>They create the experience they need to become great product managers.</p><p>This person is a needle in a haystack. An almost impossible combination of structured thinker and visionary leader, with incredible passion but also firm follow-through, who’s a vibrant people person but fascinated by technology, an incredible communicator who can work with engineering and think through marketing and not forget the business model, the economics, profitability, PR. They have to be pushy but with a smile, to know when to hold fast and when to let one slide.</p><p>They’re incredibly rare. Incredibly precious. And they can and will help your business go exactly where it needs to go.</p><p>Chapter 5.6
Death of a Sales Culture
Salespeople are traditionally paid on commission. That means that after a customer completes a transaction, the salesperson gets paid some percentage of the sale price or receives a bounty—a bonus—for each sale they complete. The bigger the deal, the more deals they close, the bigger the paycheck. Typical commissions are paid out in full at the end of the month or quarter.</p><p>This is commonly believed to be the best way to align business goals with sales team goals and hit revenue targets that will show investors real progress. People—especially salespeople—will tell you that this is the way it’s always been done, that it’s the only way to do it and it’s the only path to hiring a decent sales team. Those people are wrong.</p><p>Even if on the surface everything seems to be working, there are a lot of downsides when the traditional commission model is fully played out. Most notably, it can breed hypercompetition and egoism and incentivize making a quick buck rather than ensuring that customers and the business are successful in the long term.</p><p>There is a different model that aligns short-term business goals without neglecting long-term customer relationships. It’s based on vested commissions.</p><p>Rather than focusing on rewarding salespeople immediately after a transaction, vest the commission over time so your sales team is incentivized to not only bring in new customers, but also work with existing customers to ensure they’re happy and stay happy. Build a culture based on relationships rather than transactions.</p><p>Here’s how to set it up at your company:</p><ol><li><p>If you’re starting a new sales organization, do not offer traditional monthly cash commissions. It’s best to have everyone in your company compensated in the same way—so offer salespeople a competitive salary and sales performance bonuses of additional stock options that vest over time. Stock provides a built-in incentive to stick around and invest in long-term customers who are good for the business.</p></li><li><p>If you’re trying to transition to a relationship-driven culture, you may not be able to kill traditional commissions right away. In that case, any stock or cash (stock is still preferable) that you give as a commission should vest over time. Pay 10–15 percent of the commission at first, then another tranche in a few months, then another a few months after that, etc. If the customer leaves, the salesperson loses the remainder of their commission.</p></li><li><p>Every sale should be a team sale. So if you have a customer success team (the team that actually delivers, sets up, and maintains whatever is sold to the customer), then it should sign off on every deal. Sales and customer success should be under one leader, in the same silo, being compensated in the same way. In this setup, sales can’t just throw a customer over the fence and never think about them again. If there’s no customer success team, then sales should work very closely with customer support, operations, or manufacturing—create a board of people to approve each commitment.</p></li></ol><hr><p>I didn’t learn all this at General Magic. Or Philips. Or Apple. Or Nest.</p><p>I learned it first from my dad.</p><p>He was a salesman for Levi’s in the seventies, when Levi’s jeans were an international obsession. He could have made tons of money unloading Levi’s crappier designs on retail stores and swiftly moving on. But he was a great salesman. Year after year he won all the sales awards—I’d see the trophies and plaques he’d bring home. And his goal was never short-term gain. It was trust.</p><p>So he showed his customers the entire lineup of products, told them which were selling well, which weren’t. He steered them toward the cool styles, away from the stuff no one was buying. And if the customer wanted something he didn’t offer, he pointed them to a competitor who did.</p><p>Those customers remembered him. And the next season or the next year or ten years down the road, they would call him up again. They’d make an order. And again the next season. And the season after that.</p><p>My dad was on commission but he would often sacrifice a sale in order to build a personal connection. The best salespeople are the ones who maintain relationships even if it means not making money that day.</p><p>Those are the salespeople you want on your team. Because if you do it right, they truly will become part of the team, rather than mercenaries who swoop in, make their money, then jump ship to the next hot company, leaving a trail of problems behind them.</p><p>The danger with traditional commission-based sales models is that they create two different cultures: a company culture and a sales culture. The employees in these two cultures are compensated differently, think differently, care about different things. Hopefully most people in your company will be focused on the mission—on achieving something great together, grinding away at a big, shared goal. Many salespeople won’t give two shits about your mission. They’ll be focused on how much they’re making month to month. They’ll want to close deals and get paid. It won’t matter what they’re selling as long as it sells.</p><p>The bigger your company, the further these two cultures will drift apart. Huge commissions, sales awards, and sales conferences where everyone high-tails it to an island, ready for a weekend of drinking, may feel great for your sales team in the moment. But they can drag morale down for the rest of the company. Why are we here working, building this thing, while they’re getting wasted in Hawaii, doing shots out of their Best Salesperson of the Year trophy?</p><p>And this isn’t to say sales is not important. It’s vital. It brings in customers and cash that are absolutely necessary to keep a company alive. But it’s not more important than engineering or marketing or ops or legal or any other part of your business. It’s just one of many critical teams, all working together to make something great.</p><p>But if sales is off to the side, doing their own thing, barely part of the company but steadily meeting their monthly goals, that can breed an insulated, transactional culture. And the way customers are treated in that kind of culture can be brutal—even in places where you’d assume customers must be treated well in order for salespeople to make any money.</p><p>I worked for a commission exactly once—when I was sixteen years old, selling crystal and china at a department store called Marshall Field’s. And I was great at it—the old ladies loved me. They’d pinch my fat cheeks, ask about my mother, get my address to send me Christmas cards—and leave with armloads of crystal glasses, dishware, and odd-looking fine china sculptures. It completely infuriated all the other salespeople. We were paid almost entirely in commission every two weeks and this no-nothing kid was taking food out of their mouths. So every time a nice old lady beelined toward me, they’d try to steal her and my sale. They’d literally fight over who was going to make the sale as the customer was standing right in front of us. They didn’t care who this person was or what she wanted—they were only after the five- or ten-dollar commission.</p><p>And this was at Marshall friggin’ Field’s. That feeling gets multiplied exponentially as the dollar amounts and pressure grow. Things get much more cutthroat. And they get gross.</p><p>There are a lot of movies about terrible sales cultures—Boiler Room, The Wolf of Wall Street, Glengarry Glen Ross. They’re sensationalized, but not by much. The hypercompetition often breeds the kind of ego-driven, boozy, locker-room backslapping where everyone ends up at a strip joint, trying to drink each other under the table. Reasonable people are trapped and feel like they have to keep up appearances, while unreasonable people spin wildly out of control—puke in hotel lobbies, get dragged out of the company holiday party by cops.</p><p>It happens all over the place—from Silicon Valley to New York to Jakarta, in tiny businesses and vast corporations. Companies think they can control the worst of it—that a little bad behavior is just the cost of a high-powered sales team. What’s the problem if everyone’s hitting their sales targets?</p><p>The problem is that one day something will go wrong. Maybe it’ll be with the product—you’ll have an issue and business will slow down. In that moment, the time when you need them most, your sales team will abandon you. They’ll go wherever the sales are hot. Why should they stick with you if they can’t make money right now?</p><p>Or you might find out that those great numbers they’ve been putting up aren’t so great after all. Maybe they’ve been telling little white lies about your team’s capacity or your product’s ability to meet customers’ needs. Maybe all those customers flowing into your business have been sold something you can’t actually give them. And now they’re pissed.</p><p>When you start out, your first customers are incredibly precious. They’re the ones who love you best, who take a risk on you. And they can make or break your company—they’re the source of all your initial word of mouth. In the beginning it feels like you know practically each customer by name and face and Twitter handle. But as your business grows and a traditional sales culture takes hold, those customers stop being seen as individuals. They turn into numbers. Into dollar signs.</p><p>But they’re still people, even when you’re in hypergrowth mode. The relationships you form with them are still meaningful and necessary. Really great, enlightened salespeople hold on to those relationships. But many salespeople won’t.</p><p>If your sales culture is driven by transactions, then any relationship the salesperson cultivates will evaporate immediately after the customer signs on the dotted line. You don’t have a relationship with an ATM machine—you just walk up to it and take your money. And once a customer feels like an ATM, clawing them back is almost impossible. You have to bend over backward, twisting yourself into knots trying desperately to convince them to trust you again. Customer success or support will apologize and apologize and backpedal, cursing the sales team under their breath the whole time.</p><p>You’ll probably still lose that customer.</p><p>That’s why relationship sales cultures aren’t naive or simplistic. They’re necessary. And they’re proven. It’s the sales culture we set at Nest. It’s the culture I’ve pushed dozens of startups to adopt. It works better. Every single time. You get happier customers. You get a happier culture. You get teamwork and focus and progress toward your goal.</p><p>Ideally you set up your business this way from the start. Everyone gets paid in salary, stock, and performance bonuses—sales, customer success, support, marketing, engineering, everyone. That’s not to say they get paid the same amount, but the compensation model is the same—everyone is aligned.</p><p>And nobody ever works a sale alone. During the sales process, the salesperson has backup from customer success or support or whoever will be working closely with the customer post-sale. And then those teams sign off on the deal. There are never any surprises—everyone knows exactly what’s expected of them to make this new customer successful. And once the deal is closed, the salesperson doesn’t disappear. They stay on as a point of contact for that customer, and if there’s any kind of issue, they step in to resell them.</p><p>If you already have a transaction-oriented sales org and want to make the shift to a relationship-based one, it’ll be trickier. People will probably leave. A lot of them will tell you you’re crazy. But it can be done.</p><p>First set up a mini–internal board populated by those other teams—customer support, customer success, operations—to approve each sales deal. That will start shifting the mindset from lone-wolf salesperson to being part of a team. Then start talking about the change to commissions. Don’t say you’re getting rid of them—that messes with people’s heads—just say that you’re doing them differently. Boost the size of the commission but start vesting it over time. And tell the sales team they’ll lose the remainder of the commission if the customer leaves. You can also offer an even larger commission if they’ll take stock over cash.</p><p>Once commissions are vested on a schedule that prioritizes customer relationships, a lot of the ugliness that usually defines sales cultures disappears. Salespeople do a better job qualifying customers, the hypercompetition eases up, the backslapping fades, the teams align their expectations and their goals.</p><p>It just works better. For everyone.</p><p>The old commission model is an anachronism. It’s outdated and rewards all the worst behavior. But it is useful for one thing: weeding out the assholes.</p><p>There are many incredible salespeople out there who will raise an eyebrow at the idea of vested commissions, then lean in and ask to hear more. Others will sneer and roll their eyes and tell you you’ll never be able to hire anyone. They won’t listen when you explain and will strut out the door, confident they know better and that you’re completely crazy.</p><p>Don’t hire those people.</p><p>Find people who are intrigued by the idea of vested commissions. Find people who realize they can actually make more money this way. Find people who are good human beings in addition to being good at sales. Find people who will care about your mission and be thrilled with the vital role they’ll play in making it a reality.</p><p>It might not be easy. Especially if there’s a ton of competition for talent. There are situations and industries where building a whole new sales culture and organization just isn’t feasible. In that case, you just need one. Find a sales leader who understands and values customer relationships—someone who won’t stand for egoism or cutthroat competition and who won’t hire assholes or mercenaries. That leader will shape the culture of their organization to be more relationship-oriented, until the world catches up to what you’re doing and you can implement vested commissions.</p><p>These people exist. They’re tired of transactional cultures, too. They want to do right by their customers. They want to feel like part of a real team. Hire them.</p><p>Chapter 5.7
Lawyer Up
Your company will typically need all kinds of lawyers: for contracts, to defend you from lawsuits, and generally to keep you from making stupid mistakes or falling into traps you never saw coming. Early on you can make do with an outside law firm, but eventually that will get too expensive (you’ll frankly be amazed how expensive) and you’ll probably need to hire lawyers in-house.</p><p>But remember that if you’re running a business, every decision involving legal matters is a business-driven decision. Purely legal-driven decisions only happen in court. Your legal team is there to inform your choices, not make them for you. So a “no” from legal isn’t the end of the conversation—it’s the beginning. A great lawyer will help you identify roadblocks, then move around them and find solutions.</p><hr><p>Most lawyers excel at two things: saying “no” (or “maybe”) and billing you.</p><p>That’s not necessarily because they’re bad lawyers; it’s just how the system is set up.</p><p>Law firms are generally all about billable hours. The first fifteen minutes they talk to you might be free, but they’ll charge for every fifteen minutes after that, or even every five. They’ll bill you for the time they spent thinking about your company in the shower. They’ll bill you for copies, travel, and postage (with an added handling fee, too). They’ll charge extra every time they need to call in someone with a specific legal expertise—so if your lawyer brings you into a conference call with another lawyer, expect a jaw-dropping bill.</p><p>I once had a lawyer who started every conversation with a little chitchat—how’s the family? Some weather we’re having! I didn’t want to be rude, so I spent a few minutes chatting. But that very polite, normal small talk meant that questions that should have been answered in 15 minutes or less were going 30 or even 45. And this lawyer cost $800–$1,000 an hour. I was paying him hundreds of dollars to talk about my kid’s music recital. After three or four conversations, I realized what he was doing and fired him. I can only imagine how he was inflating his billable hours when I wasn’t on the phone.</p><p>When you’re hiring an outside law firm, you want a lawyer who talks fast and does not care about your children—at least not when they’re on the clock.</p><p>The good news is that some law firms are shifting to a new model—fixed-price contracts or not-to-exceed contracts where everyone agrees on the price up front. Some legal firms will help with rote company formation and boilerplate legal stuff for a small fee or some stock. And there’s a new movement to “open source” many important legal documents—to make generic versions that can work for most businesses.</p><p>But even if you use open-source legal docs, you still need a lawyer to handle the details. And that lawyer will probably still bill you from the shower.</p><p>So to get the most out of your lawyer, you need to understand how they operate and how they approach their work. Lawyers are trained to think from the competitor’s viewpoint or the government’s viewpoint or that of pissed-off customers or irate partners or suppliers or employees or investors. Then they look at what you’re working on and say, “Doing it this way will almost certainly get you in trouble.” Or, on a really good day, “Doing it this way may turn into a lawsuit but we’ll probably be able to handle it.”</p><p>You will never get a pure, unadulterated “yes, go ahead—there’s no danger ahead” because there’s no ironclad way to prevent a lawsuit. Anyone can sue you for anything—at least in the United States. Customers will sue you for changing something they liked. Competitors will sue you as a business tactic to shut you down. Merit may have nothing to do with it—they’ll hammer you with nuisance lawsuits just to drain your coffers and your will.</p><p>If you’re moderately successful at something disruptive, you’ll probably be a target. If you’re really successful, you definitely will be.</p><p>So the possibility of a lawsuit should always be a risk that you’re weighing. But a lawsuit isn’t the end of the world. And a “maybe” or even a “no” from your lawyers isn’t always a reason to immediately stop what you’re doing. You have to weigh their input against the needs of your business and against the fact that you need to take risks to innovate and succeed. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t follow legal advice—it just means that legal shouldn’t be your only consideration.</p><p>Of course, this doesn’t apply to anything actually illegal. Or lies. Or any of the basic stuff you need a lawyer for—contracts or HR or the terms you put on your app for protections and privacy. For that sort of thing, do not screw around. Listen to your lawyer and follow their advice explicitly. If you don’t have a lawyer on staff, then hire a firm and deal with the bill. You do not want your business to crumble because of a stupid mistake—because you screwed up your employment agreements or your terms and conditions.</p><p>But for the gray areas, for the tricky stuff, for the million nuanced opinion-driven decisions that will determine the direction of your company, always remember that lawyers live in a black-and-white world. Legal versus illegal. Defendable versus undefendable. Their job is to tell you the law and explain the risks.</p><p>Your job is to make the decision.</p><p>The first time I had to deal with a lawsuit was at Apple. I remember feeling like a deer in headlights. Creative, the maker of the second most popular music player after the iPod, sued us over the iTunes interface to transfer songs to the iPod and the technology that enabled it. It wasn’t clear-cut whether we had infringed or not, whether we would win or not, and Steve was worried. We’d built Apple their first great new product in years, and now they were getting sued for it.</p><p>Chip Lutton, who led all intellectual property legal work at Apple, partnered with me and Jeff Robbin, the VP of iTunes, to find solutions to work around the issues. We proposed different ways to change the product, but in the end Steve ended up making the business decision to settle. In fact he settled for $100 million, tens of millions more than Creative had asked for. He wanted them completely out of our hair, never to return.</p><p>It was an interesting lesson in what winning meant. It wasn’t a proper legal victory—we never defended ourselves, never went to court—but it was a win for Steve. It was more important for him to never spend another second of his life worrying about this lawsuit than to save money or face.</p><p>Pretty quickly after we launched the Nest Learning Thermostat, we got sued by Honeywell. This was a very different lawsuit. They were fully committed to litigating us out of existence. Their strategy was to squash the little guy and all but steal their technology for a pittance. Our legal team was confident we could win—the lawsuit was ridiculous, frivolous, a well-known tactic to slow down a fast-growing competitor. But I’d learned from my experience at Apple—I couldn’t just hand the decision for what to do over to legal.</p><p>Lawyers love to win—they will never give up the fight, will battle to the death. But this is business. Death is not an acceptable option. You don’t get a great ROI with death.</p><p>When you’re in any kind of negotiation that includes legal, you always need to work out the fundamental deal points first, before the lawyers get called in—how much you’re paying for something, how much you’re willing to spend, how long a contract should last for, exclusivity, etc. Get the term sheet roughly approved, then let the lawyers argue the legalese. Otherwise negotiations can drag on forever, with you footing the bill as your lawyers fight with their lawyers.</p><p>Nobody wants to deal with that.</p><p>That’s why even when we were right on the verge of triumph in our lawsuit with Honeywell, we settled out of court. By that time Google had bought our company and Honeywell was a major customer of theirs. It didn’t matter that we were right and Honeywell was wrong; it was a business decision. Google decided that paying off Honeywell and maintaining that relationship was preferable to going to court—especially since the cost of the settlement came out of Nest’s coffers and not Google’s.</p><p>It pissed us off no end. We would have won, but instead Nest got stuck with the bill. It was enraging. But it was the right call for Google.</p><p>The best lawyers understand that. They don’t only think like a lawyer. They take into account all their training and knowledge, but also weigh business objectives. They can help you understand the risks while also being very aware of the benefits.</p><p>They give you well-reasoned advice rather than tell you what you can and can’t do. They realize their voice is part of a chorus. And as you work together and get a feel for each other and they get a handle on what the competitive landscape looks like and who your customers and partners are, great lawyers will loosen up a little. It takes most lawyers months or even years working with a company to really understand which risks are worth worrying about and which can be mostly ignored. But a well-seasoned, experienced, and business-practical lawyer who can communicate risk effectively can be worth their weight in gold.</p><p>Getting a lawyer like this generally requires you to hire one in-house. Usually you’ll know it’s time to start the hiring process when legal gets way too expensive—too many hours to deal with the same agreements and questions, too much back-and-forth, too many times you need them to search for too-rare specialists.</p><p>An in-house lawyer won’t solve your need to hire specialists—for taxes, HR, fund-raising, M/A, IP and patents, government rules—but they will help you negotiate the bills after you get them. Because there’s always room for negotiation—especially with lawyers. An experienced lawyer who understands a law firm’s business model and knows the tricks can look at their bill and ask why it took this many hours for this task or why this conversation was billed in this way.</p><p>When considering your first legal hire, you may be tempted to hire a generalist—someone who can do a bit of everything. People think that will cut down on their need to hire outside specialists. But it’s the opposite.</p><p>At this moment, you’re not hiring for breadth. You need to understand what’s at the core of your company—what your business is ultimately about—and hire for those specific legal specialties.</p><p>Too many times I see companies where intellectual property is their biggest differentiator, but they get a regular contracts lawyer to run the legal team. It’s a costly mistake. The lawyer ends up outsourcing all IP legal work, negating any cost savings, and then can’t even provide guidance to outside counsel. When the first legal hire doesn’t have experience and expertise in critical areas, the legal team ends up weaker for it—more risk averse, less flexible, less able to work with the rest of the business to creatively solve problems and build effective long-term legal strategies for the company.</p><p>At Nest, we knew from the start that everything would come down to IP. Nest’s special sauce was always going to be our technological innovations. And those innovations would have to be aggressively patented to keep them out of the hands of the competition.</p><p>So our first lawyer was Chip Lutton, the same lawyer I’d worked with on the iPod lawsuit.</p><p>We needed a leader who already had a deep understanding of the issues that would be at the heart of our business, who could think that way from day one and build his team with that perspective in mind. And we needed someone who could act as a moral compass, who could go toe-to-toe with execs and engineers and marketers.</p><p>We needed a leader who could lead.</p><p>Who would be respected and thoughtful enough to be an active part of product development.</p><p>Chip and his team were never back-office. They were always in the thick of it with us, thinking through product features, making sure we could defend our patents, looking over our marketing copy, beating back lawsuits. And getting into fights with me.</p><p>Like the one about the baby.</p><p>In June 2015 we launched the Nest Cam, a video camera that you could use for security or as a pet cam or baby monitor. And in the United States, any electronics intended to be used in a baby’s room must come with this warning:</p><p>image
Fig. 5.7.1</p><p>The world’s most hideous, most aggressive, bright orange-and-red warning label, required on all electronics that could be used in a baby’s room.</p><p>Dwight Eschliman</p><p>And I said, “No way. We are not launching our new product with a picture of a strangled baby.”</p><p>We’d already put the strangulation warnings all the way through the app, in the installation instructions, the manual, the setup. We made it impossible to ignore. None of our competitors’ products had gone to the depth we had. And they all had the same cables!</p><p>I was upset, angry. I stormed around the room. I said no. Absolutely not.</p><p>And Chip calmly told me the consequences: best case a hefty fine and a recall. Worst case legal action by the federal government.</p><p>The label could not be shrunk. It could not be changed. It couldn’t even be a different color.</p><p>In this case there was no nuance, no gray area, no discussion. The law was very prescriptive. This was not an opinion-based decision where legal was just one voice in the chorus and I could follow my gut. Ignoring Chip’s advice in this instance wouldn’t be a strategic business move—it would be a stupid mistake. The risks were not worth the rewards.</p><p>Sometimes in life you just have to nestle your new product right next to a picture of a baby in mortal peril. If we wanted to market Nest Cam as a baby monitor, we had to have the label.</p><p>But even then, Chip worked with me to find a solution. He never simply said “no” and walked away. He always helped us find a compromise, a new opportunity, a different direction.</p><p>We ended up making the label even bigger and uglier than necessary—put it right up next to the product so it was impossible to miss. We knew everyone just tore the damn thing off, so we made it really easy to tear and made sure there was no sticker residue left behind. We even had a few testing sessions to make sure it worked (don’t you wish new mattresses did the same?).</p><p>Chip made sure we were in the clear.</p><p>He’s a great lawyer, but he’s also an amazing partner.</p><p>That’s what you’re ultimately looking for. You don’t want a lawyer who thinks their only job is to point out the sinkhole you could fall into, to block your way. Hire someone who will help you find a new path. Hire someone who will build a bridge. Hire a lawyer who doesn’t just think like a lawyer.</p><p>Part VI
Be CEO
The connected home was going to really blossom with the Nest Protect smoke and CO alarm.</p><p>Nest Protect would act as a temperature and humidity sensor for the Nest Learning Thermostat so you could have climate control room by room. It would use its motion sensor to detect when nobody was home so the thermostat could turn off the heat or AC right away to save energy. And it would use its voice to do more than just warn you of danger—the vision for Nest Protect was for it to be a really great speaker. There’s a smoke alarm in every room in the house, so we planned to have it play music and even work as an intercom. You’d call up to the Nest Protect in the kitchen that dinner was ready and the smoke alarm in your kid’s bedroom would carry your voice.</p><p>Now add a video camera or a smart lock into the mix and you’ve got a built-in security system with sensors in every room and alarms throughout the house. With every new Nest you’d install, your old Nest products would get better. Do more things. Open new avenues of convenience and possibility. And it would require very little from you. It would all just . . . work.</p><p>The whole point of the connected home was for it to be effortless. For your house to take care of you rather than you taking care of it.</p><p>And we weren’t blind to the dozens of other connected products sprouting up around us once the Nest Thermostat showed what was possible. Instead of treating them as competition to be squelched, we nurtured the ecosystem with a low-powered networking technology called Thread. If you built a decent smart device, you could hook into the Nest system and work with Nest products—your smart ceiling fan could connect to our thermostat or Nest could tell your smart lights that you were on vacation so they could make it look like you were home and fool potential thieves.</p><p>Nest was building a platform—an ecosystem of our own and third-party products all controlled by one application—that would elevate the connected home into something truly magical. We were going to weave a tapestry of technologies that would fundamentally change what home could be.</p><p>That was the vision, anyway.</p><p>The vision that Google bought for $3.2 billion in 2014.</p><p>Google had been close to Nest from the beginning. I’d shown Sergey Brin some prototypes before we launched and Google wanted to buy our company back in 2012. They wanted to help us reach our vision faster. When we declined, they offered to invest instead.</p><p>In 2013, as we were in the midst of another successful funding round, they pushed to acquire us again.</p><p>I knew that if they were that eager to buy Nest, it meant they could be getting serious about building smart-home hardware. And if Google was getting serious, then Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, and the other tech behemoths could be looking into it, too. Nest had started this snowball rolling and now it was causing an avalanche.</p><p>If we weren’t careful we could quickly get buried.</p><p>Nest was doing really well, selling our products as fast as we could make them. We could have just kept building the thermostat—its impact had already eclipsed our wildest expectations. People were putting thermostats—thermostats!—under their Christmas trees. David Letterman and Kanye West wrote to us asking for our product when we were sold out.</p><p>But we were dead set on building a platform—a large and meaningful one that could last decades—and that would require vast resources.</p><p>Huge companies like Google or Apple with other highly profitable revenue streams and tons of products could quickly displace us with their own platform. All they’d need to do was to announce a plan to enter the connected-home space. It wouldn’t matter if their platform was any good—when a giant company makes an announcement, that alone puts a thumb on the scale. They could lure away all our potential partners and developers or just keep them from fully committing to us while they took a “wait and see” approach.</p><p>I had seen too many successful products and platforms from little startups die when bigger players moved in and sucked up all the oxygen in the room.</p><p>But by joining Google we wouldn’t just be protecting ourselves—we’d be accelerating our mission. That’s what really excited the exec team. The potential for growth.</p><p>So after a lot of deliberation and nervousness, we decided, as a team, that it was the right time to sell. We had a strong hand—plenty of funding, more investors circling, and solid unit economics. Our business was lean, our thermostats profitable, another product was shipping, and we had more in development.</p><p>And Google had made a commitment to invest $4 billion in our connected home platform over five years and provide necessary resources—servers, AI algorithms, developer relations. We agreed that they’d set aside what they’d started building in connected-home hardware and focus entirely on Nest. We agreed to coordination meetings every other week with the teams whose technology we’d need to integrate with.</p><p>We had plenty of concerns about a culture clash, but the Google team reassured us that Nest’s mission-driven culture would set a new standard and help drive a cultural evolution at Google. They told us we’d get a huge boost in sales and that we’d be able to bring our platform to life years faster than we could as an independent company.</p><p>They told us this was going to be a beautiful marriage.</p><p>After three or four months of intense discussions, we both walked into the wedding in January 2014 believing we were going to stay together for good. That this was going to work. That we would make it work. Both companies had the very best intentions.</p><p>But everyone knows what the road to hell is paved with.</p><p>Within hours of the acquisition, Nest tried to calm a wave of bad press by publicly declaring our culture and systems completely separate from Google. After that, there was organ rejection. The natural antibodies at Google detected something new, different, foreign and did everything they possibly could to avoid or ignore it. They would smile and smile but the promised meetings, the oversight from Google management, the plans we’d made to integrate—they all started to fall apart.</p><p>Even the basic, no-brainer stuff stalled out: Can we sell Nest products in the Google Store? No. Not for at least a year. Can we get off Amazon Web Services and onto Google Cloud? No, not without a huge set of changes. And it’ll actually be more expensive.</p><p>That shouldn’t have been a shock, though. Everything was more expensive.</p><p>In 2014, just before the Google acquisition, Nest spent around $250,000 per employee per year. That included decent office space, good health insurance, the occasional free lunch, and fun perks from time to time.</p><p>After we were acquired, that number shot up to $475,000 per person. Some of the increase was due to corporate red tape and increased salaries and benefits, but a lot of it was the added perks of free buses, free breakfast, lunch and dinner, tons of junk food, gleaming conference rooms with full A/V setups, and new office buildings. Even IT was expensive. It cost $10,000 per year to connect each employee’s computer to the Google Network and that didn’t even include the price of the laptop.</p><p>Of course, Nest wasn’t perfect, either. We had so many different projects going at once that we had indigestion. The Nest Secure security system was perpetually delayed as we launched a second-generation Nest Protect and a third-generation thermostat. We’d also bought a company called Dropcam and created the first Nest Cam and added it to the Nest app and spent countless hours trying to integrate with Google and figure out email addresses, corporate security, whose servers had what data on them, privacy policies, etc.</p><p>And despite being part of Google, we made little attempt to be Googley, to truly join the culture. A small contingent of Nesters had come from Apple, where Google was Enemy #1 and they had to be talked down from a cliff. But most of us just liked our way of doing things. We didn’t want to be Googley. I wasn’t about to wear a propeller baseball hat, like new Googlers do. I can understand why we stood out like a sore thumb, why we weren’t welcomed with open arms.</p><p>But even with all that, the acquisition wasn’t a complete disaster. It was a work in progress.</p><p>Our brand and unit economics were strong. We were still growing quickly. In fact the Google acquisition had given a bunch of retailers the confidence to start selling Nest products in their stores. Developers for our ecosystem were also signing on in much larger numbers. And we were making minor inroads with certain teams at Google, though not nearly the progress we’d expected. But we had time. The plan was five years of runway to build a true smart-home platform. And there were so many amazing people at Google, so many incredible teams building incredible technology that we could work with to create something truly spectacular and important. We just had to keep pushing. We could get there.</p><p>Then, in August 2015—a little over a year after the acquisition closed—Google cofounder Larry Page called me into his office. He said, “We’ve got an exciting new corporate strategy for the company. It’s called Alphabet. And we want Nest to be the model for how to do it right.”</p><p>They were restructuring Google—creating an umbrella company called Alphabet to hold Google and all its “other bets” as subsidiaries. That way Wall Street could see the health of Google’s Search and Ads business without anything clouding the financial picture. The “other bets”—like Google Fiber, Calico, Verily, Capital G, Google Ventures, Google X with its myriad of “moonshot” projects, and, of course, Nest—would become independent sister companies that were no longer part of Google. Suddenly Nest would become one of the biggest, most public, and most expensive of the sisters.</p><p>For sixteen months we’d been focused on trying to integrate with Google, to become one with the mothership and get all the goodness we needed to accelerate our vision. That integration and technology access was the main reason we agreed to be acquired in the first place. But Larry told me that was over. New direction. New strategy.</p><p>“How long have you been thinking about this?” I asked.</p><p>“Years,” he said.</p><p>“How many people at Google have been thinking about this?”</p><p>“Three or four for a couple months. You’re one of the first people I’m telling.”</p><p>I thought, “Great! Thanks!” But I said, “Okay—we’ll need to understand the details to make sure we’re all aligned. How much time do we have to dig in and work out a concrete plan? A few months?”</p><p>I knew better than to say “no” without a detailed rebuttal. But I needed to buy time to figure out how to undo this—to get our team a better deal.</p><p>“We don’t have a few months.”</p><p>“Eight weeks?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“A month?”</p><p>“We’re going to announce it next week,” he said. “We’re a public company—it would be a disaster if this leaked to the press. This is just a finance and accounting change; don’t worry about it, we’ll figure it out.”</p><p>I was shocked. Speechless. So much for delayed intuition. I thought to myself, Fire, ready, aim.</p><p>There was no plan in place. None. I’m all for “Do. Learn. Fail,” but you can’t turn an entire company upside down without at least a semblance of a strategy. What should have been a data-driven decision had turned into an opinion-driven one.</p><p>Larry told me he’d been watching how Warren Buffett did it at his firm. He’d even flown to Nebraska to talk to him about it. Berkshire Hathaway buys unrelated companies that are run separately and it works great. “Why can’t we do the same?”</p><p>I pointed out that Berkshire Hathaway buys companies that are ten, fifteen, fifty years old. They’re fully formed, have plenty of revenue. They’re grown, healthy adults. Alphabet’s other bets were infants, toddlers, adolescents trying to find themselves. They were still scrambling to innovate, trying to find a path to profitability. The fundamentals were totally different.</p><p>But that didn’t matter. The steamroller was already on its way.</p><p>Within twenty-four hours of the Alphabet announcement, Google Facilities said, “You’re not part of Google anymore, so you’ll need this” and handed us a bill in the millions for our new office that they’d just remodeled.</p><p>To add insult to injury, our cost per employee more than doubled—a 2.5x increase. And nothing was different—everyone at Nest was doing the same job in the same place. Now we just had to pay for it ourselves, including an Alphabet corporate tax for any service that Google supplied. So the basics we relied on—IT, legal, finance, HR—got instantly more expensive. Sometimes ridiculously expensive. We heard, “Sorry we have to do this. It’s a FASB <!-- -->[Financial Accounting Standards Board]<!-- --> requirement. No way to get around it since we’re a public company.”</p><p>In that same instant, the technology teams at Google that we’d finally started integrating into happily washed their hands of us. “You aren’t Google,” they told us. The antibodies were on full-scale attack.</p><p>It was shocking to watch the speed with which their priorities changed.</p><p>But the worst part was the bullshitting.</p><p>I started getting allergic to the word “thoughtful.” Every time Google senior management wanted us to swallow some new strategy, they’d tell us it was, despite appearances, extremely thoughtful. “We’re being thoughtful about the Nest integration into Google.” “We’re going to be thoughtful about your transition to Alphabet.” “Matt and Tony, don’t worry—we’ve been thoughtful about this.”</p><p>I’d hear it and think, Oooohhh noooo, here it comes again, as they thoughtfully bullshitted me, then expected me to pass that bullshit on to my team.</p><p>Matt and I had been beating the drum for integration for over a year, but now we had to turn 180 degrees and beat the drum for Alphabet. I had to tell our team that things were going smoothly even as I watched Google leadership “thoughtfully” jury-rig a plan as the transition was already under way, then change that plan constantly over the next few months. It was a complete mess of Alphabet implementation meetings each week—finance, legal, IT, sales, marketing, PR, facilities, HR. One day we’d be told that this is how they’ll bill for buses or facilities or legal service, and then two weeks later it would get rethought.</p><p>Then, as the cost of Nest being Alphabetized became known, the new finance regime swooped in.</p><p>The Alphabet steering committee said we need to rationalize Nest’s expenses and get to profitability faster. They pointed out that we weren’t hitting our sales numbers. I pointed out that they’d made those numbers up. They’d assumed that Nest products would be sold in the Google Store and that would boost our sales by 30–50 percent. But then the Google Store had stalled and waffled and our sales actually fell as customers wary of Google’s privacy policy stayed away.</p><p>When it was clear I wasn’t going to budge, Larry told me that we had to reach profitability. “I need you to get bold and creative and figure out how to cut everything by fifty percent.” And he literally meant everything: head count, expenses, and our road map.</p><p>“WHAT?!” I said. Nothing had changed—our agreement was the same, our plan was the same. But now they wanted me to lay off half our team, most of who we had just hired over the previous months.</p><p>Larry told me not to worry about firing everyone. He said there were plenty of open jobs at Google that they could easily move into. And I thought, Has this guy ever had to personally lay off people in his life? You can’t just play with people’s lives like that.</p><p>But Google wanted to show Wall Street that one of their businesses beyond search and advertising could actually be profitable. Every other piece of hardware they made—the cell phones, the Chromebooks—was bleeding money. Nest was the only one that had a shot of reaching profitability, so they focused all their attention on us.</p><p>But there was no way—absolutely no way—I was going to hack Nest in half.</p><p>We proposed 10–15 percent reductions but flatly refused to change our road map. We would not back down from our mission.</p><p>Needless to say, tensions were high.</p><p>Four months later, I got hit with another bombshell.</p><p>Larry Page told me he wanted a divorce.</p><p>He was going to sell Nest.</p><p>However, Larry didn’t actually say it. Bill Campbell, my mentor and a mentor to Larry, asked me to stay late one day after a board meeting, just days before the end-of-year holidays. After everyone cleared out, he and Larry were left. Bill took one look at me and said, “I’m just going to cut to the chase. Larry will have a hard time saying it and I’m not going to bullshit you. Larry wants to sell Nest. I don’t understand it, but this is what he wants to do.”</p><p>Larry looked at Bill, shocked. “Well, you didn’t have to say it like that!”</p><p>But he did. Bill knew me. And Larry didn’t. Not really. I suspect he wanted Bill in the room because he was worried I’d freak out. He wanted a witness and a buffer for our breakup in case things got heated.</p><p>Instead I sat there in silence, trying to hear every word, watching every micro-expression on their faces as Larry tried to explain the situation.</p><p>Then I said, “Larry, you bought Nest. You can sell Nest if you want. But I’m absolutely not going with it.”</p><p>I was done.</p><p>Bill looked at Larry and said, “I knew it. I told you that would be his answer.”</p><p>Even now, I’m not exactly sure why Google decided to sell. Maybe it all came down to the culture clash—maybe Larry thought we were too far apart, too incompatible. When I asked, they gave me the usual reasons: we’ve decided Nest is no longer strategic, it’s costing us too much money. But even as Google had changed, our agreement hadn’t—we’d been up front about our road map, our plan for the future. They knew when they signed the deal that we were an expensive investment. And they’d been more than willing, in fact had been eager, to fund our vision less than two short years ago.</p><p>“We have a new finance strategy now,” they said. And that was that.</p><p>Bill was beside himself after the meeting. “You guys have popular products, solid economics and growth, and a pipeline of new products with real potential. You have way more going for you than most of the projects around the company,” he told me, his head in his hands. “It doesn’t make any sense whatsoever. We were just getting started!”</p><p>Over his objections, Google brought in the bankers so I could help them “preserve asset value.” And since I had already said I was leaving, the only thing I could do was try to minimize the damage, to smooth the transition for my team as much as I could. I fell into the role of being a good soldier. I did what I was told, helped the bankers prepare the documentation for a sale. They began shopping Nest around in February 2016.</p><p>The bankers worked down their possible-acquirers list and a few companies came to the table. At the head of the line was Amazon.</p><p>The bankers asked Larry if he’d sell to Amazon and he said, “Yeah, I think I would.” I was shocked again—sell to one of their competitors? It felt like another slap in the face.</p><p>As talks moved forward, I stuck to my word. I left Nest. Walked away from our marriage. They said they wanted a divorce so I gave them a divorce.</p><p>And then, months after I left, Google changed their mind. Again.</p><p>They decided not to sell Nest after all.</p><p>In fact, they decided that Nest was better as part of Google rather than being lumped in with the “other bets” of Alphabet. And Nest was reabsorbed.</p><p>It was the strategy du jour—join Google, leave Google, join Google. All the while, Nest’s management team had to stand in front of employees and promise that everything was going to be great! But there was no denying that the flip-flopping was painful—for our customers, for the team, for their families. Executive management seemed to have an utter disregard for our employees and the work they were trying to achieve.</p><p>In the end, when Google reabsorbed Nest in 2018, they moved ahead with the 10–15 percent reductions I’d proposed back in late 2015. Rejoining the mother ship also eliminated the overhead costs of Alphabet—that additional $150,000 per head and the myriad taxes and higher fees. Suddenly it seemed Nest was a great investment again.</p><p>I can’t explain it. Just as I never learned their true reasons for selling Nest, I never heard an explanation for why they decided to keep it. Maybe the fact that Amazon was interested made Larry realize that Nest was a valuable asset after all. Maybe it was all an elaborate game of chicken to get me to toe the line and cut costs. Maybe they never had a real plan to begin with and this all happened because of some exec’s casual whim. You’d be surprised how often that’s the reason behind major changes.</p><p>People have this vision of what it’s like to be an executive or CEO or leader of a huge business unit. They assume everyone at that level has enough experience and savvy to at least appear to know what they’re doing. They assume there’s thoughtfulness and strategy and long-term thinking and reasonable deals sealed with firm handshakes.</p><p>But some days, it’s high school. Some days, it’s kindergarten.</p><p>That was true when I first joined the C-suite at Philips and when I became a VP at Apple and when I was CEO of Nest and when I entered the ranks of Google execs. All these jobs felt incredibly different, but at their core the responsibilities were the same—it was less and less about what you were making and more about who you were making it with.</p><p>As CEO, you spend almost all your time on people problems and communication. You’re trying to navigate a tangled web of professional relationships and intrigues, listen to but also ignore your board, maintain your company culture, buy companies or sell your own, keep people’s respect while continually pushing yourself and the team to build something great even though you barely have time to think about what you’re building anymore.</p><p>It’s an extremely weird job.</p><p>So if you’ve climbed to the top of the corporate mountain and now are frostbitten and oxygen-deprived and wondering when the Sherpa will get there, then here are some of the things I’ve learned.</p><p>Chapter 6.1
Becoming CEO
There’s nothing exactly like being a CEO, and nothing to prepare you for it—not even being the head of a huge team or division of a company, firmly in the C-suite. In those positions, there’s always someone above you—but the buck truly stops with the CEO. And as CEO, you set the tone for the company. Even if there’s a board, partners, investors, employees—ultimately everyone looks to you.</p><p>The things you pay attention to and care about become the priorities for the company. The best CEOs push the team to strive for greatness, then take care of them to make sure they can achieve it. The worst CEOs care only about maintaining the status quo.</p><p>There are generally three kinds of CEOs:</p><ol><li><p>Babysitter CEOs are stewards of the company and are focused on keeping it safe and predictable. They generally oversee the growth of existing products that they inherited and don’t take risks that might scare executives or shareholders. This invariably leads to the stagnation and deterioration of companies. Most public company CEOs are babysitters.</p></li><li><p>Parent CEOs push the company to grow and evolve. They take big risks for larger rewards. Innovative founders—like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos—are always parent CEOs. But it’s also possible to be a parent CEO even if you didn’t start the business yourself—like Jamie Dimon at JPMorgan Chase or Satya Nadella at Microsoft. Pat Gelsinger, who recently took over the Intel CEO position, seems to be Intel’s first parent CEO since Andy Grove.</p></li><li><p>Incompetent CEOs are usually either simply inexperienced or founders who are ill-suited to lead a company after it reaches a certain size. They are not up to the task of being either a babysitter or a parent, so the company suffers.</p></li></ol><hr><p>The job is to give a shit. To care. About everything.</p><p>I remember going to the Aston Martin factory once to have a meeting with the CEO. It was 9 a.m. and pouring as we drove through the lot. At one point we had to stop the car as a guy covered in bright yellow raingear and galoshes hurried across our path. When we got to the meeting, in comes the guy in the galoshes. It was the CEO. Andy Palmer had been walking the lot, personally inspecting each car that came off the line.</p><p>The CEO sets the tone for the company—every team looks to the CEO and the exec team to see what’s most critical, what they need to pay attention to. So Andy showed them. He stepped into the rain and looked at the engines, the upholstery, the dashboards, the exhaust pipes, everything. He rejected any car that wasn’t perfect.</p><p>If a leader gets distracted from the customer—if business goals and spreadsheets full of numbers for shareholders become a higher priority than customer goals—the whole organization can easily forget what’s most important.</p><p>So Andy showed every person in that company where their priorities should be. He didn’t care how much it cost to reach perfection, how many times a car had to get retooled, reworked. The important thing was to deliver exactly what the customer expected. To overdeliver.</p><p>If you want to build a great company, you should expect excellence from every part of it. The output of every team can make or break the customer experience, so they should all be a priority. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 3.1: Making the Intangible Tangible.]</p><p>There can’t be any functions that you dismiss as secondary—where you casually accept mediocrity because it doesn’t really matter.</p><p>Everything matters.</p><p>And it’s not just about you.</p><p>If your expectations are that everyone puts out their best work, if you’re looking at customer support articles that will be posted on your website with the same critical eye as engineering or design, then the technical writers of those articles will feel the pressure, will bitch and moan, will get stressed out, and then they will write the most incredible support articles of their lives.</p><p>That’s not a hypothetical example. I read most of the key customer support articles for all our products at Nest. Those articles were the first thing a customer having issues would see. This customer would be frustrated, irritated, right on the brink of anger. But a spectacular experience with support could instantly turn that frustration into a moment of delight—into a customer who would be with us forever. I couldn’t ignore the importance of that moment because it was “just” support. So I read the articles. And I critiqued them. In fact, through that process I learned things about the product experience that I didn’t know—and didn’t like—and worked to fix them.</p><p>And I read these articles with the support and engineering teams around me—I wanted all of us to question the content, to make sure our support site was as crisp and easy to understand as our marketing and sales materials. I showed them through my actions that what they did was important. And when they came back with a new version, I read that, too. And I tore it apart until each article told a story. Until they gently guided customers to understanding rather than just barking confusing instructions at them.</p><p>When you truly give a shit, you care, you don’t let up until you’re satisfied, you pick things apart until they’re great.</p><p>People will hand you something that they worked on tirelessly for weeks, that they’ve thought through and are proud of, that’s 90 percent amazing. And you will tell them to go back and make it better. Your team will be shocked, stunned, possibly even dejected. They’ll say it’s already so good, we’ve worked so hard.</p><p>You’ll say good enough is not good enough. So they’ll march out the door and do it again. And, if necessary, again. They might get so tangled up that it’ll be simpler to just start from scratch. But with each iteration, each new version, each regroup and reimagining, they’ll discover something new. Something great. Something better.</p><p>Most people are happy with 90 percent good. Most leaders will take pity on their teams and just let it slide. But going from 90 to 95 percent is halfway to perfect. Getting the last part of the journey right is the only way to reach your destination.</p><p>So you push. Yourself. The team. You push people to discover how great they can be. You push until they start pushing back. In these moments, always err on the side of almost-too-much. Keep pushing until you find out if what you’re asking for is actually impossible or just a whole lot of work. Get to the point of pain so you start to see when the pain is becoming real. That’s when you back down and find a new middle ground.</p><p>It’s not easy. But all that attention, that care, the quest for perfection—they’ll raise the team’s own standards. What they expect of themselves. After a while, they’ll work incredibly hard not just to make you happy, but because they know how much pride they feel when they do world-class work. The entire culture will evolve to expect excellence from each other.</p><p>So your job is to care.</p><p>Because you’re it. You’re the top of the pyramid. Your focus, your passion, trickles down. If you don’t give a shit about marketing, you’ll get shitty marketing. If you don’t care about design, you’ll get designers who don’t care, either.</p><p>So don’t worry about picking your battles. Don’t rack your brain trying to decide which parts of your company need your attention and which don’t. They all do. You can prioritize, but nothing ever comes off the list. Avoiding or ignoring any part of your company only comes back to haunt you sooner or later.</p><p>At Nest I met with product teams and marketing every two weeks and customer support every month, and I’d have a meeting with every team at the company at least twice a year. Even if you were building internal software tools for HR or operations, eventually you’d be called to show your strategy. I’d watch the presentation and then dig in—Do we have the right IT back end to do this? How are you planning to get around this issue? How can other people on the team help? How can I help?</p><p>It didn’t matter if this team was building internal tools that customers would never see. The company depended on those tools, and internal customers should be treated as well as external ones.</p><p>So I listened closely, gave them my full attention (don’t be checking your phone or computer), and helped them move past their roadblocks. That’s often all it takes.</p><p>And if you’re not an expert at internal software tools or PR or analytics or growth or whatever needs you to have an opinion today—if you’re not sure what’s great and what’s just okay—then ask questions. I love asking dumb, obvious questions or questions from the customer’s perspective—usually three or four “Why is that . . . ?” “Why did that . . . ?” questions will get to the root of what you’re trying to understand, then you can dig in further. And if that’s not enough, then call in the experts. Bring in experienced people from your team (or sometimes from outside it) who can confirm your inklings or steer you in the right direction until you learn enough to trust your gut.</p><p>You don’t have to be an expert in everything. You just have to care about it.</p><p>No matter your leadership style, no matter what kind of person you are—if you want to be a great leader, you have to follow that one cardinal rule.</p><p>The other commonalities of successful leaders are just as straightforward:</p><p>They hold people (and themselves) accountable and drive for results.
They’re hands-on, but to a point. They know when to back off and delegate.
They can keep an eye on the long-term vision while still being eyeball-deep in details.
They’re constantly learning, always interested in new opportunities, new technologies, new trends, new people. And they do it because they’re engaged and curious, not because those things may end up making them money.
If they screw up, they admit to it and own their mistakes.
They’re not afraid to make hard decisions, even when they know people will be upset and angry.
They (mostly) know themselves. They have a clear view of both their strengths and challenges.
They can tell the difference between an opinion- and data-driven decision and act accordingly. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 2.2: Data Versus Opinion.]<!-- -->
They realize that nothing should be theirs, even if the genesis was with them. It all has to be the team’s. The company’s. They know their job is to jubilantly celebrate everyone else’s successes, to make sure they get credit for them, and hold little for themselves.
They listen. To their team, to their customers, to their board, to their mentors. They pay attention to the opinions and thoughts of the people around them and adjust their views when they get new information from sources they trust.
Great leaders can recognize good ideas even if those ideas didn’t come out of their own mouths. They know that good ideas are everywhere. They’re in everyone.</p><p>Sometimes people forget that. They firmly believe that if they didn’t think of it, it’s not worth thinking about. That sort of egoism can also extend way beyond individuals—many CEOs get so wrapped up in their own companies that they dismiss the competition. If it wasn’t invented here, it can’t possibly be any good.</p><p>It’s the kind of thinking that kills companies, that collapsed Nokia, that toppled Kodak. It’s probably what was in Steve Jobs’s head when he refused to meet with Andy Rubin.</p><p>I’d known Andy, the founder of Android, since we worked together at General Magic. And in the spring of 2005 he heard through the rumor mill that Apple was working on a phone. So he called me up. He wondered if Apple might be interested in investing in or possibly buying Android, his latest project to create an open-source phone software stack.</p><p>I went straight to Steve. I pointed out that it was a capable team and a great technology. We could use their tech to get a jump-start on the iPhone and eliminate a potentially formidable future competitor in one acquisition.</p><p>In typical Steve Jobs fashion he said, “Fuck that. We’re doing it ourselves. We don’t need any help.”</p><p>Part of Steve’s reaction was clearly motivated by confidentiality—the other part was Not Invented Here Syndrome.</p><p>But I knew Andy and the threat his project might pose, so I brought up the topic again two weeks later, in front of Apple executives and iPhone development leads. Steve didn’t want to hear it. A week later I emailed Andy and got no response. A month after that, we saw the announcement that Google had bought Android.</p><p>It’s hard to imagine what could have happened if Steve had had just one meeting with Andy to understand his strategy, never mind buy his company. How would the world have changed? How would Apple have changed?</p><p>It’s poison to think great ideas can only come from you. That you alone can hoard them in one place. And it’s stupid. Wasteful.</p><p>A CEO has to recognize fantastic ideas—regardless of their source. But Apple was Steve’s baby and every other baby on Earth was uglier and dumber than his.</p><p>I read a study the other day that said that the brain patterns of entrepreneurs thinking about their startups are extremely similar to those of parents thinking about their children. <!-- -->[See also: Reading List: “Why and how do founding entrepreneurs bond with their ventures?”]<!-- --> You are literally a parent to this business—you love it like you birthed it, like it’s a part of yourself.</p><p>And sometimes your love for your child blinds you to its faults or the brilliance of other ways of doing things, other ways of thinking.</p><p>On the other hand, that all-consuming love can help you push your company forward.</p><p>As a parent you never stop worrying about your kid, planning for your kid, pushing your kid to do better, be better. A parent’s job isn’t to be friends with their kids all the time—it’s to build them into independent, thoughtful humans who will be ready and able to thrive in the world one day without their parents.</p><p>Kids often resent them for it. Cry, slam doors, wail in anguish when you make them turn off the TV, get their homework done, get a job. But you can’t be a good parent if you’re worried about your kid being mad at you.</p><p>Sometimes your kid won’t like you.</p><p>Sometimes your employees won’t, either. Sometimes they’ll hate your guts.</p><p>I remember walking into meetings and everyone rolling their eyes and sighing. I could see it on their faces, “Oh fuck, here we go again.” They knew I was going to keep harping on that one thing that everyone was sick and tired of hearing about. That one thing that was already 90 percent great and that would be so much work to change—too much work—but that I knew in my gut was the right thing for our customers.</p><p>It’s not a great feeling, having twenty people look at you like that. Like you’re being ridiculous, unreasonable. Like what you want is impossible.</p><p>It’s how we looked at Steve Jobs when he told us five months before the first iPhone shipped that it needed a glass front face covering the display instead of plastic. The front face is the most important part of the hardware—it’s the surface you touch constantly.</p><p>He realized plastic wouldn’t cut it. If we wanted it to be great, it would have to be glass. Even though we had absolutely no idea how to do it. Even though he knew we’d all have to work nonstop until we got it right, sacrificing our time with our families, our plans and vacations.</p><p>But Steve was a parent CEO. A pushy parent. A tiger mom. He knew if we kept pushing, together, we’d figure it out. The sacrifices would be worth it.</p><p>And he was right. That time. But not every time. Steve took a lot of risks, made bad decisions, launched products that didn’t work—the original Apple III, the Motorola ROKR iTunes phone, the Power Mac G4 Cube, the list goes on. But if you aren’t failing, you aren’t trying hard enough. He learned from the screwups, was constantly improving, and his good ideas, his successes, totally wiped away his failures. He was constantly pushing the company to learn and try new things.</p><p>That’s how he earned the team’s respect. Even when the product took a turn, a huge pile of extra work fell on everyone’s shoulders and we knew Steve wouldn’t delay the schedule by a millisecond. It drove us crazy, but the team respected his dedication to getting it right.</p><p>In this job, respect is always more important than being liked.</p><p>You can’t please everyone. Trying can be ruinous.</p><p>CEOs have to make incredibly unpopular decisions—lay people off, kill projects, rearrange teams. Often you’ll have to take decisive action, hurt people to save the company, to cut out a cancer. You can’t skip surgery because you don’t want to upset Team Tumor.</p><p>Delaying hard decisions, hoping problems will resolve themselves, or keeping pleasant but incompetent people on the team might make you feel better. It may give you the illusion of niceness. But it chips away at the company, bit by bit, and erodes the team’s respect for you.</p><p>It turns you into a babysitter. And kids may like the babysitter at first—it’s nice to go to the local park, to watch movies and eat pizza. It’s fun for a while. But eventually kids want to go further, do more. They want to go skateboarding. They want to explore. So they might start testing their boundaries to see what they can get away with. They might roll their eyes when the babysitter tells them what to do. Because a babysitter is not a parent. All kids need someone they respect who truly knows them. Who gives them a push at the right time, who helps them grow.</p><p>And they need someone they can project their hopes and aspirations onto.</p><p>In the past, in the misty days before you could Google everything about everyone, that’s what people did with their leaders. That was one of the things that enabled leaders to succeed. People could believe in, trust, and follow an idealized version of Lincoln and Churchill, Edison and Carnegie.</p><p>When your team knows too much about you as a person, not just you as a CEO, they start dissecting your personal life to try to understand your decisions. Your motivations. Your ways of thinking. That’s not only a distracting waste of time, it’s counterproductive. When you explain why you’re doing something, it should be all about the customers, not about you.</p><p>So it’s wise to stand alone—not to let anyone at work get too close. Even if you wish you could just grab a drink with your team like you used to.</p><p>It’s a cliché to say “It’s lonely at the top.” But it’s also true.</p><p>Most people assume being CEO is a hard job—stressful, busy, high-pressure. But the stress is one thing; the isolation is another. You might have a cofounder, but you shouldn’t have a co-CEO. It’s a one-person job and you’re all alone up there.</p><p>And just because you’re in charge does not mean you’re in control. You plan out your day, think you’re finally going to have some time to talk to people, look at the product, meet with engineering. Then your day disappears. There’s always some new crisis, some new people problem, someone quitting, someone complaining, someone falling apart.</p><p>And you can never tell if you’re getting it right. When you’re an independent contributor, you can typically look at something you’ve made that week and be proud of it. When you’re a manager, you can look at the collective achievement of your team and feel a sense of accomplishment and pride. When you’re a CEO, you dream that maybe, ten years down the road, some people will think you did a good job. But you can never tell how you’re doing in the moment. You can never sit back and look at a job well done.</p><p>This job can suck you dry if you let it.</p><p>It can also be one of the most liberating experiences of your life.</p><p>Since I was a kid, I tried to convince people to follow my crazy ideas. I spent so much time and energy and emotion desperately trying to get them to do things differently. The crazier the idea, the more it cut against the grain, the longer and harder I had to fight for it.</p><p>And so often the answer I got was no. No. Not right now. Long before Apple got into the game, I pitched the concept for an early iPod-like MP3 player to RealNetworks, Swatch, Palm. Everyone turned it down. No. No. Maybe we’ll consider it next quarter. Maybe next year.</p><p>But when you’re CEO, you’re in charge. Sure, you’re constrained by money or resources or your board, but for the first time there are no constraints on your ideas. You get to finally test out the things that other people told you couldn’t be done. It’s your opportunity to put your money where your mouth is.</p><p>That freedom is thrilling and empowering and utterly terrifying. There is nothing scarier than finally getting what you want and having to take responsibility for it, good or bad. And the tables begin to turn—as CEO you can’t say “yes” to everything. You have to become the one who says “no.” Freedom is a double-edged sword.</p><p>But it’s still a sword. You can use it to cut through the bullshit, the hesitation, the red tape, the habituation. You can use it to create whatever you want. The right way. Your way.</p><p>You can change things.</p><p>That’s why you start a company. That’s why you become CEO.</p><p>Chapter 6.2
The Board
Everyone needs a boss to be accountable to and coaches who can help them through difficult times—even a CEO. Especially a CEO. That’s why businesses have a board of directors—typically just called “the board”—where members are directors of the company.</p><p>A board’s primary responsibility is to hire and fire the CEO. That is the main way they can protect the company and the one and only job they have that really counts. Everything else comes down to giving good advice and respectful, no-bullshit feedback that hopefully steers the CEO in the right direction.</p><p>Ultimately it’s the CEO who’s responsible for running a company. But CEOs need to prove to the board that they’re doing a good job, or risk being fired. That’s why board meetings are so important, and why truly understanding your subject matter and doing a great deal of prep work beforehand is vital. The best CEOs always know the outcome of a board meeting before they walk through the door.</p><hr><p>Bad CEOs come to board meetings and expect the board to help them make decisions.</p><p>Good CEOs walk in with a presentation of where the company was, where it is now, and where it’s headed this quarter and in the years to come. They tell the board what’s working but they’re also transparent about what isn’t and how they’re addressing it. They present a fully formed plan that the board can question, object to, or try to modify. Things might get a little heated, a little bumpy, but in the end everyone walks out of the meeting understanding and accepting the CEO’s vision and the company’s path forward.</p><p>Then there are the great CEOs. With great CEOs the meeting is smooth as butter.</p><p>Watching Steve Jobs in an Apple board meeting was like watching a master conductor direct an orchestra. There was no confusion, no conflict. The board members already knew most of what he was going to say so they could just smile and nod. Occasionally someone would start a “what if” discussion and Steve would calmly let it meander for a couple of minutes, then say, “Let’s talk about this outside the meeting, we still have lots to cover” and everyone would quietly settle down. Then in grand Steve style he’d whip out something fun and exciting to surprise the board—a new prototype or a never-before-seen demo. Everyone would walk out of the room happy and confident that Steve was leading Apple in the right direction.</p><p>Bill Campbell helped me understand how he did it. Bill would always say that if there was any potentially surprising or controversial topic, the CEO should go to every board member, one-on-one, to walk them through it before the meeting. That allowed them to ask questions, offer different perspectives, and then the CEO had time to take those thoughts back to the team and revise their thinking, presentation, and plan.</p><p>There should only be good surprises in a board meeting—We’ve exceeded our numbers! We’re ahead of schedule! Check out this cool demo! Everything else should be a known quantity. It’s best not to debate new discussion items in the boardroom—there’s just never enough time to cover them in detail and get to a resolution. It always goes nowhere.</p><p>This is particularly true for public company boards. It’s mostly because of their sheer size—they can have more than fifteen members, which makes meaningful debate more or less impossible—but also because of all the red tape and the laws surrounding them. Public boards are way more work for board members and execs alike and are infinitely more complicated than those at private companies. There might be up to ten additional committee meetings surrounding each board meeting, so the whole thing can take days.</p><p>(If a banker tries to convince you that going public is no big deal and won’t radically change how you spend your time, do not listen to them. This is just the tip of the iceberg.)</p><p>Private company board meetings are shorter, typically quieter, more focused on the work and mentorship. They usually take two to four hours, sometimes five. It’s less performative, less formal. Hopefully there are no committees in the early years at your startup, and only one or two (like an audit to oversee your financial statements) when you’re in the growth stage.</p><p>The best thing about private boards is that you can keep them small—three to five board members is best. You can just have an investor, an insider, and an outsider with a specific expertise you really need.</p><p>But you also have to remember that even with a small board, the meeting’s still not small. The room has twice as many people as you’d expect. In addition to the CEO and board members there’s a lawyer, formal observers with some stake in the company, and informal attendees, like members of your exec team.</p><p>Before your first product ships, typically pre-revenue, meetings are pretty straightforward: you walk through anything pressing that needs board approval, then focus on your immediate progress in getting your product built. Where are we on the schedule? Are we spending money on budget? It comes down to what’s going on internally and if you’re on track to meet your goals.</p><p>After your product launch, and hopefully with revenue coming in, your board meetings will focus more on data and what’s happening externally—what’s the competition doing, what are customers asking for, how well are we attracting and retaining customers, what kinds of partnerships have you set up. And as always when you’re presenting numbers, it becomes much more important to craft a narrative. You have to tell a story. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 3.2: Why Storytelling.]<!-- --> Your board isn’t in the business every day like you are—they can’t immediately understand the nuances or what the numbers actually mean unless you give them context.</p><p>Being able to help the board grasp exactly what’s going on is good for the CEO, too. The better you can explain something, the more you understand it. Teaching is the best test of your own knowledge. If you’re struggling to explain what you’re building and why, if you’re presenting a report without really understanding it, if the board is asking you questions that you can’t answer—then you have not internalized what’s actually going on at your company.</p><p>That’s when you might have a real problem.</p><p>It doesn’t happen all that often, but sometimes a board does its most important and least pleasant job: they remove the CEO. Usually it’s because the CEO is in the wrong—they’re incapable or incompetent or pushing an agenda that will lead to ruin. Or sometimes a first-time founder has done a great job up until now but the company needs someone with different expertise and skills to take it to the next level.</p><p>But sometimes the problem isn’t the CEO. It’s the board.</p><p>The famous Tolstoy line “Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way” applies to boards as well. Happy, functional, effective boards are all relatively small, full of experienced operators who have built companies before, think of themselves as mentors and coaches, and actually do the work—they help you recruit and get funding and expand your expertise, sharpen your business and product strategy, watch for land mines, and give it to you straight when you’re about to step on one.</p><p>Bad boards come in all shapes and sizes and screw up in a million different ways. But they generally fall into three categories:</p><p>Indifferent boards occur when a majority of the board members are checked out. Sometimes an investor sits on a bunch of different boards and has a “you win some, you lose some” mentality—and has already put your company in the loss column. Sometimes board members are motivated for the wrong reasons—they want their payout and don’t really care about the company or its mission. Sometimes they see obvious issues with the CEO but just don’t want to do the work to remove them. Because it is work—paperwork and emotional fallout, then the search to replace the CEO, the interviews, the headaches, the internal transitions, the press, the cultural crises. They say, “It’s not really that bad, is it?” and everyone suffers with the status quo because nobody feels like stepping up to fix it.
Dictatorial boards are the opposite—too invested, too controlling. They hold the reins so tightly that the CEO doesn’t have the freedom to lead independently. Many times the board includes a previous founder (or two or three) who still wants control. So the CEO ends up behaving more like a COO—taking orders, fulfilling requests, keeping the trains running but not having much say in where they go.
Inexperienced boards are made up of people who don’t know the business, don’t know what a good board or CEO looks like, and are incapable of asking the CEO hard questions, never mind removing them. These boards are often too scared to act decisively. The investors worry that if they challenge the CEO, they won’t get to invest in the next funding round or they’ll get a reputation for firing founders and new startups won’t want to work with them.
Typically companies with inexperienced boards are always running out of money. They never meet their quarterly goals and always blame “market problems” rather than the CEO or themselves. They don’t know how to bring in new talent and new expertise and just smile and nod their way to collapse.</p><p>But even when a board isn’t great—when it pushes too hard or not hard enough, when it makes the wrong call—it’s a necessary part of any company’s infrastructure. It needs to exist.</p><p>One of the most painful parts of the Google acquisition of Nest was losing our board. We had an amazing board at Nest—structured and informed, operational and active. We could go to the board, get firm agreement on a clear strategy and plan: yes, we’re going to do this, I’ll get back to you in a week with next steps.</p><p>When we were acquired, our beloved board was dissolved and replaced with . . . nothing. We were supposed to have a governing board of several Google execs, but our meetings were either perpetually rescheduled or barely attended. We’d propose a path forward and everyone would say, “Yeah, well, let’s think about that a little bit more.” The can would get kicked down the road to the next meeting that nobody went to and we’d be left sitting on our hands.</p><p>One might look at that and say, “So what’s the problem? If the board doesn’t give you guidance, then just go do it yourself. You’re the CEO.”</p><p>But that is not the solution. Even the most incredible CEOs in the world still need a board. Not the meetings, necessarily, but the advice of smart, invested, experienced people. Even big projects within a company should have a mini-board—a collection of helpful execs who can work to guide a project lead and step in if things go sideways.</p><p>I once saw an early-stage startup with a five-person board where the CEO controlled four seats. The CEO simply installed employees and friendly outsiders in all the available spots, and if anyone voted in a way the CEO disliked, they were removed. The one board member who knew better was completely helpless.</p><p>The CEO had complete freedom to follow their vision, to run things exactly as they wanted, to build the product of their dreams. Until they belittled their team, screamed at customers, and drove the business into the ground.</p><p>Countless millions were lost, and many people quit, but the most painful thing was the stupid waste of time and resources. It was so much needless strife.</p><p>Even the best CEO cannot stand alone, untouchable, unchallengeable, accountable to no one. Everyone needs to report to someone, even if it’s a two-person board that you meet with for an hour every few months.</p><p>There always needs to be some kind of pressure-release valve. There always needs to be someone who can shake their head and give it to you straight.</p><p>And if you do it right, you should never be a victim of your board. As CEO, you help to shape it. Boards always change based on the CEO—the board under Steve Jobs was different from the board under Tim Cook. Boards complement a CEO’s strengths and no two CEOs are alike.</p><p>So when you’re choosing your board members, here’s what types of people you should be considering:</p><p>Seed crystals: Just as you need seed crystals to grow your team, you want someone on the board who knows everyone, has done it before, and can suggest other amazing people to add to the board or to your company. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 4.2: Are You Ready?: Seed crystals.]<!-- --> A seed crystal points out what your board is missing and tells you who to call, or just calls them for you. Our seed crystal for the Nest board was Randy Komisar—he’s the one who first suggested bringing in Bill Campbell. And he’s the one we’d come to if we needed help with recruiting or landing a perfect candidate.
A chairperson: This isn’t a must, but it can be helpful. A chairperson sets the agenda, leads the meetings, herds the cats. Sometimes the CEO is the chairperson, sometimes another board member is, sometimes there’s no formal chairperson at all. I’ve seen all three versions work. But what worked best for the Nest board was having Randy Komisar as our unofficial chairman. Instead of me having to do all the 1:1s with board members myself, Randy would go talk to each one, pre-negotiate, and come up with the opinion of the group. He also interviewed execs for Nest and helped fill out the executive roster. A chairperson is the CEO’s closest relationship on the board, a mentor and a partner. They help the CEO through issues they have with other board members, or they step in when the business gets hairy and the team gets scared. They’ll attend employee meetings and give them the board’s perspective on how the company is doing—they’ll say, “The CEO’s not going anywhere, she’s doing a great job.” Or “The board’s not worried about the recent sales, and you shouldn’t be, either. We can’t wait to invest again.” Or sometimes, “Yes this person has left, but the company will be okay. Here’s the plan that the board supports.”
The right investors: When you’re picking investors, you’re also picking one or two of them to be board members. So you don’t want investors who think only in numbers and dollar signs and don’t understand the slog and grind of creation. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 4.3: Marrying for Money.]<!-- --> Find investors who are experienced in the work you do and empathetic to how difficult it is to get right. Find human beings who you’d love to have dinner with. If you have an interesting enough company, you can talk to your investors in advance and select the person the firm will put on your board. Sometimes CEOs don’t take the top-dollar investment deal, to ensure that they get a better board member.
Operators: These are people who have been in your position before and know the roller coaster of company building. When the investor board members start hammering you for not hitting your numbers, the operator board members can step in and explain the realities of the situation. They can talk about how nothing ever goes according to plan. Then they can help you forge a new plan with new techniques and new tools.
Expertise: Sometimes you’ll need someone who deeply understands something very specific—patents, B2B sales, aluminum manufacturing, whatever—but they’re too experienced or too entrenched in their current project to take a job at your company. So the only way to get them is through a spot on your board. When Apple was thinking about getting into retail for the first time, neither Steve Jobs nor anybody else on the board knew how to do it. So they brought on Mickey Drexler, the CEO of GAP. Mickey’s the one who told them to get an airplane hangar and fully prototype a few different store designs, then walk through them in person like a real customer would before deciding which to take to the public. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 3.1: Making the Intangible Tangible.]<!-- -->
The best board members are mentors first. They’re able to offer sound, helpful advice at critical moments in your product’s life or in yours. And they give as well as take—they enjoy the process of being on your board because they’re learning something, too.</p><p>You just have to make sure they don’t use those learnings against you.</p><p>When someone joins a board, they have a legal obligation to act in the best interests of the company they’re serving. It’s called a duty of care and a duty of loyalty. Usually people take this pledge seriously. But not always.</p><p>Sometimes people take advantage of their position. Sometimes they need to be removed. Sometimes it’s dramatic.</p><p>But that’s rare. Reshuffling a board is generally uncomfortable and tricky, but not impossibly so. You’ll see it happen when you’re a new CEO of an existing company and you inherit a board, or if you want to add a new expertise but not a new seat. The key is doing it in phases and with set time limits. First move a board member into an observer role for a couple of quarters, then move them out and the new person in. Doing it right takes time and patience.</p><p>And as always, even with the pressure, the flurry of meetings, the 1:1s and planning, you can’t forget about your team. Board meetings are always moments of high stress for the entire business where everyone desperately wants to know what’s going on and starts getting nervous about the outcome.</p><p>So don’t make everyone wait and gossip and squirm. At Nest, most of the exec team knew exactly what was going on because they were in the boardroom with me, and we always showed a redacted version of the board presentation to the whole company as soon as possible after the meeting. Here’s what we talked about, here’s what I’m concerned about, this is what the board had questions about, here are actions we’ll take.</p><p>It kept everyone in lockstep and quashed rumors. And if something changed, people were able to start working on those changes right away.</p><p>When you have a great board that you respect, meetings are a great, almost external heartbeat that focuses the entire company and forces you to organize your thoughts and timelines and story. <!-- -->[See also: Figure 3.5.1, in Chapter 3.5.]</p><p>It’s worth it. But that doesn’t make it any less work. For everyone.</p><p>That’s why Jeff Bezos once told me never to join anyone else’s board. “It’s a waste of time,” he said. “I’m only going to be on the board of my company and my philanthropy. That’s it!”</p><p>I think of him every time I decline another board seat.</p><p>But I don’t decline them all. My first instinct is always “No,” but occasionally, rarely, that hard “No” turns into a “No. Unless . . .”</p><p>If you’re trying to fill chairs and create the best board possible, remember that it’s a two-way street. Most board members are experienced, busy, and highly sought after, so give them an incentive to join you. And I don’t just mean stock. One of the best things about sitting on the board of a rising company is that you can get an early look into consumer behavior or new trends or disruptions. Anyone on the Apple board in the early 2000s, for example, got a preview of the iPhone and could plan ahead for what that product would do to their business.</p><p>Those kinds of insights are incredibly exciting for potential board members and the main reason people are always clamoring to get on the Apple board. Another reason is that they love Apple. They genuinely want to help the company succeed. They’re willing to put in the time and effort because Apple is important to them.</p><p>Just keep in mind that public and private boards are very different. There’s a lot more risk and work involved with being part of a public board, so you’ll need a bigger reward to lure in the kinds of board members you’ll need. Especially because most if not all of your early-stage board will probably resign when you go public. Public board members can get sued by shareholders. They have to go to countless committee meetings for audits, compensation, or governance. If things go sideways, they might get hammered in the press.</p><p>So the bar for taking a corporate public board seat versus an early-stage private board seat is very different.</p><p>Then again, any board seat comes with some level of cachet. It’s good for the ego. Good for the pocketbook. But you never want that to be your main draw. Avoid celebrity board members, people who sit on a dozen or more boards or people who are only looking to get seats to pad their résumé. It’s all too easy for them to check out. To become bored or indifferent. Or to put their interests above your company’s.</p><p>You want board members who are truly, deeply excited by what you’re making. Who can’t wait to hear what you’ve been up to. Who aren’t just there for the meetings but are with you day in and day out, helping you, finding opportunities for you to succeed. You want a board that loves your company. And that your company loves back.</p><p>Chapter 6.3
Buying and Being Bought
When two fully formed companies merge, their cultures need to be compatible. Just like any relationship, everything ultimately comes down to how well people get along, what their goals are, what their priorities are, and what drives them crazy. Fifty to 85 percent of all mergers fail due to cultural mismatches.</p><p>If a large company is acquiring a tiny team—a dozen people or fewer—cultural mismatch is much less of an issue. But even then, that tiny team should carefully assess how they’ll be digested by the larger org and really take their time to understand the culture of the company they’re about to join.</p><hr><p>I don’t regret selling Nest to Google. Neither does our executive team. We always revisit this question when our old team meets up. Our only regret is that we didn’t get to finish what we started. But we made the decision to sell together, and we all stand by it today.</p><p>Given the data we had at the time, we’d do it again.</p><p>Especially since we were right. As predicted, once Nest brought the idea of the connected home to life, the giants of Apple, Amazon, and Samsung all wanted a piece. They built teams to compete with Google and Nest and created their own home products, platforms, and ecosystems. We dodged a bullet.</p><p>And Google was and remains an incredible company. It’s filled with brilliant people at every level. It’s changed the world many times over. Google’s culture works for them—there’s a reason a lot of people never leave the mother ship.</p><p>But that culture is enabled and driven by the fact that Google’s search and advertising business pretty much prints cash. Even Googlers call it the “Money Tree.” It’s turned Google into a place of wild abundance where anyone can more or less do anything—or sometimes nothing at all. They’ve been so profitable for so long and have had so few existential business threats that they’ve never had to cut back or slim down, never had to be scrappy. They haven’t had to really fight for anything in decades. Lucky them!</p><p>But at Nest, we were fighters. Our culture was born from the Apple way, a culture that survived multiple near-death experiences over its forty-plus years of existence. We were ready to fight for our mission and our place at the table, fight to keep our culture and our way of doing things.</p><p>Then, within hours of the acquisition, we had to fight for our customers. When they heard Google was buying Nest, customers panicked that they were going to be served ads on their thermostats. Newspapers shouted that Google would track your family, your pets, your schedule in their endless lust for data. So together, Google and Nest immediately put out a statement:</p><p>“Nest is being run independently from the rest of Google, with a separate management team, brand and culture. For example, Nest has a paid-for business model, while Google has generally had an ad-supported business model. We have nothing against ads—after all, Nest does lots of advertising. We just don’t think ads are right for the Nest user experience.”</p><p>It was the right thing to do for our customers. It was exactly the wrong thing to do for our relationship with Google.</p><p>On day one, with just a tweet-sized number (of very public) words, we innocently, naively alienated the company we had just joined. Many Googlers saw us as a band of fighters running at them, armed to the teeth and ready for war, already declaring independence, already rejecting Google’s core business, and thought, Huh. What’s up with them? Not very Googley.</p><p>The Google teams with whom we’d planned to integrate and codevelop technologies and products were reluctant to work with us. They kept asking their execs for more details to figure out if they really had to help us at the expense of their own projects. Why? Why? Why do we have to help a team that isn’t Google? Over the subsequent months, every time we had to clarify yet again for customers that Nest was separate from Google, our internal reputation took another hit.</p><p>I should have remembered what it was like at Apple during the very first months when we started building the iPod. It just didn’t occur to me—Nest was so much bigger and more established than my tiny iPod team, I thought this was a completely different situation. But it was exactly the same. Back then Apple’s executive antibodies saw us coming to take their time and draw away their resources, so they tried to block our way and ignore our requests.</p><p>That’s when Steve Jobs gave us air cover, dropped bombs on the teams who were slowing us down, forced the issue, yelled sometimes to make sure we got what we needed. Steve Jobs fighting for us was ultimately what allowed us to succeed.</p><p>But Google didn’t have Steve Jobs. It had Larry Page and Sergey Brin—both brilliant and savvy entrepreneurs, but they didn’t have Steve’s fighting spirit, born from multiple near-career-death experiences.</p><p>At one point when the integrations we’d planned for completely stalled—when Googlers were literally not showing up to our meetings and ignoring our emails—Sundar Pichai told me that all the teams we were trying to work with were very busy. They didn’t have extra cycles to dedicate to Nest. And no one at Google could simply dictate to them how to get things done—it was up to the teams to decide how to use their time.</p><p>As I stared at him, my eyes widened. I saw stars. It was as if I were in a car accident. Time slowed down. All I could think was, Ooooooooohhhhh, shhhhiiiiiiitttttt.</p><p>I knew Google wasn’t Apple and that a merger of this size would be bumpy. I knew we had different cultures, different philosophies, different leadership styles. But this is the moment that I realized we’d been speaking completely different languages.</p><p>When Larry told me during acquisition that Google would marshal the team and align their priorities with ours, he was 100 percent telling the truth. But what that looked like at Google was giving the team the skeleton of a plan and letting them fill in the rest as they went. Then they’d have a meeting every so often to ask how things were going.</p><p>But I had interpreted his words through an Apple lens. If Steve Jobs said he was going to marshal the team, that meant he was going to be there every step of the way—weekly, sometimes daily. He’d assemble everyone, tell them where to go, make sure they were marching together, and drag any stragglers back in place by sheer force of will.</p><p>Even though we were promised a full blitz, nobody was going to drop any bombs at Google. They didn’t even know the meaning of the word.</p><p>The moment I realized that, I could see how we’d been misaligned from the start. We hadn’t prepared for this. We hadn’t planned for no managerial air cover. We hadn’t planned for organ rejection.</p><p>Even while we’d meticulously planned out almost everything else.</p><p>In most acquisitions it takes two to eight weeks to draft a document with the necessary terms and get to an agreement.</p><p>With Nest it took four months.</p><p>And we didn’t even discuss the sale price until ten weeks in.</p><p>Google Ventures, now known as GV, was an investor. They knew our financials and had always been extremely supportive, so I wasn’t worried about the number. I was worried about which teams we’d work with, what technology we’d share, what products we’d build. Nest wasn’t joining Google for the money—we were joining to accelerate our mission. So it was always mission first, money second.</p><p>Together with Google, we went through every single function—marketing, PR, HR, sales, every part of the company. We established where we could create synergies and where we couldn’t, figured out which managers would be assigned to us, how we would do the hiring, which perks people would get, which salaries they could expect, which teams would be working together closely, and how those relationships would be established.</p><p>It took a lot of time. In fact I was starting to get a lot of eye rolls. “Really, Tony? You want to get into the details of this now?” Yes, yes, I do. It’s important.</p><p>And it was—critically important and usually overlooked.</p><p>Most acquisitions are driven and overseen by bankers, and bankers only make the real money if the deal goes through, so they’re motivated to move fast and get paid. They don’t care about getting every detail of what happens to employees right. They don’t really care about cultural fit. Not deeply.</p><p>Bankers are usually hired on both sides of the deal to work through all the transaction details, to help everyone understand or rationalize the price of the deal and comparable deals. They walk through the market, customer, and operational synergies.</p><p>But you can’t pin down culture in a merger agreement. You can’t write it up and have everyone sign on the dotted line. It’s too squishy and sensitive, all about ineffable human relationships. And what bankers care about most is transactions, not relationships.</p><p>So most bankers don’t want two companies to slowly feel each other out, get to know each other, date before marriage. They want them to meet and get engaged on the same night. They want them in a drive-through Elvis-themed chapel where everyone’s a little liquored up so they don’t ask too many questions. They want the deal wrapped up in thirty-six hours, before anyone has second thoughts, so they can pat each other on the back for a job well done and leave you standing in a blue ruffled tuxedo trying to figure out what’s next. And if it doesn’t work out in the long run, well, they did their jobs.</p><p>That’s one of the reasons we didn’t have a banker on our end of the Google acquisition deal. I knew bankers wouldn’t care the way our team did. They’d be there to get a nice percentage of the deal for very little work compared to the years of blood, sweat, and tears from our team and investors.</p><p>Even so, the morning after the acquisition was announced, a banker showed up in the Nest lobby.</p><p>“I didn’t see a bank representing you in the deal you announced yesterday.”</p><p>“Yes—that was on purpose,” I said.</p><p>“You know, your shareholders could sue you for that,” he said.</p><p>I told him the deal was done and we didn’t need a banker.</p><p>“Well, since you don’t have a banker on this deal, could you just put our name on it?”</p><p>I raised an eyebrow, stared blankly at him, and walked away.</p><p>The banker was miffed. He couldn’t believe I wouldn’t do him the favor.</p><p>Most investment M&amp;A bankers are not your friends. I’ve seen so many small startups, especially in Europe, call in a banker to help them raise money or sell their company. The bankers promise the moon and stars but rarely deliver.</p><p>You still may need a banker for various reasons, and of course there are a few good ones out there, but you can’t let them control your merger or set your timelines.</p><p>Your job, whether you’re buying or selling, is to figure out if your two companies’ goals are aligned, if your missions nestle into each other, if your cultures make sense together. You have to consider the size of your companies. Can one be easily absorbed by the other? Is this a small team just starting out or a fully formed company with sales and marketing and HR and an ingrained way of working? If it’s the latter, you have to understand what will happen to overlapping teams, what will change for employees, what will happen to your projects and your processes. That takes time.</p><p>And although time wasn’t our issue at Nest, we did make a few major mistakes:</p><p>We put out a statement to customers without ever thinking about how it would affect our internal relationships.
I assumed that because our deal was really big—over $7 billion in total—there would be a standard of care and a fiduciary responsibility to make sure it was a success.
I listened to what Larry and Bill said about changing Google’s culture rather than talking to employees about how firmly that culture was entrenched and what their expectations of Googleyness were.
I didn’t talk to other companies that Google acquired before us.
We opened the door to Google employees who jumped from project to project and had no real interest in our mission or intention of staying when things got hard. They began to immediately dilute our culture and caused endless headaches complaining that we weren’t Googley enough. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 5.1: Hiring: But we were careful not to grow too fast.]<!-- -->
If I had talked to other VPs and directors at the company, I would have found out that we should have been much, much pickier about who we hired from the first wave of Googlers who reached out after acquisition. I only learned that I should have been wary six months later when friends at Google told me the unwritten rule: if you want to get great people off their teams, you have to fight for them. The ones who casually meander into your organization are just checking out the flavor of the month. And because Google is reluctant to fire people, many less-than-stellar performers just shift from team to team ad infinitum.</p><p>If I had spent more time with the leaders of previous acquisitions, like Motorola Mobility and Waze, I would have had a much clearer understanding of how Google digests the companies it buys. The majority of big Google acquisitions other than YouTube had been less than successful. As I soon found out, Google routinely jumped from shiny object to shiny object, and it didn’t matter that Nest’s price tag was in the billions. By the time we’d been consumed, they were already hungry again, moving on to the next meal. There was no time to make sure we were settling nicely in the belly of the beast, no interest in checking with us. We were just last night’s dinner.</p><p>If I had talked to regular employees on the teams we wanted to integrate with, I would have found out what their priorities were and whether they were remotely interested in working with us. I would have understood better what it meant to be Googley and whether we had a chance of breaking through—and whether we could ever change what being Googley really meant.</p><p>Culture is incredibly sticky. I should have remembered that. Larry, with Bill Campbell’s prodding, wanted Nest to come in and shift Google’s entire way of thinking, to give it a burst of startup mojo. But culture doesn’t work that way—you can’t repaint an old factory and show the workers a training video and think you’ve made any kind of difference. You have to tear the whole thing down and rebuild it again.</p><p>Most people and companies need a near-death experience before they can really change.</p><p>You can’t assume acquisition will mean acculturation. That’s why Apple doesn’t really buy companies with large teams. They only acquire specific teams or technologies, usually very early in their life cycle when they’re pre-revenue. That way they can easily be absorbed and Apple never has to worry about culture. They can also skip the inevitable duplication of functions between existing teams like finance, legal, and sales, or the painful process of integrating one large team into another. With the notable exception of the Beats acquisition, Apple has been laser focused on filling small, specialized technology gaps in their evolving products rather than acquiring whole new lines of business.</p><p>All acquisitions come down to what you’re trying to do when you’re buying a company—do you want to buy a team? Technology? Patents? Product? Customer base? Business (that is, revenue)? A brand? Some other strategic assets?</p><p>When you’re selling, the same questions apply. What are you looking for? Some hope to use a larger company’s resources to accelerate their vision. Others are looking for financial gain. Then there are the companies who are having problems and are trying to sell off the business to someone who believes in it. Bill Campbell liked to say, “Great companies are bought, not sold.” If you’re being acquired, you want the buyer to be desperate to buy rather than you being a seller desperate to sell. If you’re considering an acquisition, you want to be wary of anyone throwing themselves at you, pitching you too hard.</p><p>However, there’s no manual for a good acquisition. There are a million things to watch out for, but they change with every company, every deal. Just don’t ignore the hard stuff simply because it’s hard. Don’t forget to talk about culture just because nobody quite knows how to talk about culture.</p><p>Unfortunately, you can’t truly know a culture until you’re in it. It’s like dating—when two people are interested in each other, they put their best foot forward, keep up appearances. Things get much more real when they move in together and get married. That’s when you learn your wife leaves dishes in the sink to “soak” for a few days. It’s when you realize your husband always forgets to clean up his toenail trimmings.</p><p>So the dating phase of any potential acquisition is crucial. You have to check the sink for dirty dishes. You have to spot the toenail on the dining table. Look at the reporting structure and the way they hire and fire employees. Dig into what perks everyone gets. Talk about management philosophy. Make concrete plans for exactly what’s going to happen post-sale. Are you going to integrate or keep your cultures separate? What will you do about overlap? Where will this team go? Who will work on this product?</p><p>But always know that you won’t be able to predict the future. Things will change—maybe in your favor, maybe not. And so, eventually, you just have to do it. Sign on the dotted line. Trust that it’ll work out.</p><p>My advice is to always be cautiously optimistic. Trust, but verify.</p><p>Assume people have the best intentions, then make sure they’re following through on them. And take the risk. Leap. Buy the company. Sell the company. Or do neither. Just follow your gut and don’t be scared (or, rather, be scared but make the decision anyway).</p><p>If we hadn’t sold, who knows what would have happened? Nest might have been successful on its own, or maybe we would have gone under as the big entrants inevitably showed up. Or maybe the other major players wouldn’t have started working on their connected products and the entire ecosystem would have collapsed. Who knows? Can’t run the experiment twice.</p><p>And Nest isn’t dead. Far from it—it’s alive and well. It’s Google Nest now, fully integrated just like we’d always planned. And they’re still making new products, creating new experiences, delivering on their version of our vision. It didn’t turn out exactly like we wanted, but it was a tremendous learning experience and, damn, we got 70 percent there. Nest is still going, still building, and there’s nothing I feel about that but happiness.</p><p>I bumped into Sundar Pichai, now CEO of Alphabet and Google, at a party a couple of years back. He said, “Tony, I wanted to let you know that we made sure to keep the Nest brand and the name. Nest will definitely be a part of our future strategy.” I smiled wide and thanked him, touched that he went out of his way to tell me. Sundar is a class act and I’m grateful that he’s watching over the team.</p><p>I have a lot to be grateful for.</p><p>I’m grateful that Sergey Brin pushed Google to invest early in Nest, grateful that both Larry and Sergey spurred the Google machine to buy us. I’m grateful that the other industry titans have come to focus on smart home technology, and that a hundred tiny upstarts are trying to displace them. In the end that’s what will—eventually, circuitously—allow someone to reach our vision.</p><p>And also, I know that everything that happened after the acquisition wasn’t personal. Not really. It was just business. Shit happens. No grudges. Life’s too short.</p><p>I deeply, genuinely wish them well.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/xiong321123/personal-page/edit/main/docs/看书/看书1/build2.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_Z9Sw" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_vwxv"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/publicPage/docs/看书/看书1/build1"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">build1</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/publicPage/docs/看书/看书1/build3"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">build3</div></a></nav></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">文档</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/publicPage/docs/intro">介绍</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">交流</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/JcuDDQ2wpINoTdbsCT1kfQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">微信公众号<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/docusaurus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">个人微信号<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">更多</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/publicPage/blog">Blog</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2024 王雄.</div></div></div></footer></div>
