Patrick J. O’Haire joined one of my classes.
He had had little education, and how he loved a scrap!
He had once been a chauffeur, and he came to me because
he had been trying, without much success, to sell
trucks. A little questioning brought out the fact that he
was continually scrapping with and antagonizing the
very people he was trying to do business with, If a prospect
said anything derogatory about the trucks he was
selling, Pat saw red and was right at the customer’s
throat. Pat won a lot of arguments in those days. As he
said to me afterward, &quot;I often walked out of an office
saving: ‘I told that bird something.’ Sure I had told him
something, but I hadn’t sold him anything.”
Mv first problem was not to teach Patrick J. O’Haire to
talk. My immediate task was to train him to refrain from
talking and to avoid verbal fights.
Mr. O’Haire became one of the star salesmen for the
White Motor Company in New York. How did he do it?
Here is his story in his own words: “If I walk into a
buyer’s office now and he says: ‘What? A White truck?
They’re no good! I wouldn’t take one if you gave it to
me. I’m going to buy the Whose-It truck,’ I say, ‘The
Whose-It is a good truck. If you buy the Whose-It, you’ll
never make a mistake. The Whose-Its are made by a fine
company and sold by good people.’
“He is speechless then. There is no room for an argument.
If he says the Whose-It is best and I say sure it is,
he has to stop. He can’t keep on all afternoon saying,
‘It’s the best’ when I’m agreeing with him. We then get
off the subject of Whose-It and I begin to talk about the
good points of the White truck.
“There was a time when a remark like his first one
would have made me see scarlet and red and orange. I
would start arguing against the Whose-It; and the more
I argued against it, the more my prospect argued in favor
of it; and the more he argued, the more he sold himself
on my competitor’s product.
“As I look back now I wonder how I was ever able to
sell anything. I lost years of my life in scrapping and
arguing. I keep my mouth shut now. It pays.”
As wise old Ben Franklin used to say:
If you argue and rankle and contradict, you may achieve
a victory sometimes; but it will be an empty victory because
you will never get your opponent’s good will.
So figure it out for yourself. Which would you rather
have, an academic, theatrical victory or a person’s good
will? You can seldom have both.
The Boston Transcript once printed this bit of significant
doggerel:
Here lies the body of William Jay, .
Who died maintaining his right of way-
He was right, dead right, as he sped along,
But he’s just as dead as if he were wrong.
You may be right, dead right, as you speed along in
your argument; but as far as changing another’s mind is
concerned, you will probably be just as futile as if you
were wrong.
Frederick S. Parsons, an income tax consultant, had
been disputing and wrangling for an hour with a gover-ment
tax inspector. An item of nine thousand dollars was
at stake. Mr. Parsons claimed that this nine thousand
dollars was in reality a bad debt, that it would never be
collected, that it ought not to be taxed. “Bad debt, my
eye !&quot; retorted the inspector. “It must be taxed.”
“This inspector was cold, arrogant and stubborn,” Mr.
Parsons said as he told the story to the class. “Reason
was wasted and so were facts. . . The longer we argued,
the more stubborn he became. So I decided to avoid
argument, change the subject, and give him appreciation.
&quot;I said, ‘I suppose this is a very petty matter in comparison
with the really important and difficult decisions
you’re required to make. I’ve made a study of taxation
myself. But I’ve had to get my knowledge from books.
You are getting yours from the firing line of experience.
I sometime wish I had a job like yours. It would teach
me a lot.’ I meant every word I said.
“Well.” The inspector straightened up in his chair,
leaned back, and talked for a long time about his work,
telling me of the clever frauds he had uncovered. His
tone gradually became friendly, and presently he was
telling me about his children. As he left, he advised me
that he would consider my problem further and give me
his decision in a few days.
“He called at my office three days later and informed
me that he had decided to leave the tax return exactly as
it was filed.”
This tax inspector was demonstrating one of the most
common of human frailties. He wanted a feeling of importance; and as long as Mr. Parsons argued with him,
he got his feeling of importance by loudly asserting his
authority. But as soon as his importance was admitted
and the argument stopped and he was permitted to expand
his ego, he became a sympathetic and kindly
human being.
Buddha said: “Hatred is never ended by hatred but by
love,&quot; and a misunderstanding is never ended by an argument
but by tact, diplomacy, conciliation and a sympathetic
desire to see the other person’s viewpoint.
Lincoln once reprimanded a young army officer for
indulging in a violent controversy with an associate. “No
man who is resolved to make the most of himself,” said
Lincoln, &quot;can spare time for personal contention. Still
less can he afford to take the consequences, including
the vitiation of his temper and the loss of self-control.
Yield larger things to which you show no more than
equal rights; and yield lesser ones though clearly your
own. Better give your path to a dog than be bitten by
him in contesting for the right. Even killing the dog
would not cure the bite.”
In an article in Bits and Pieces,* some suggestions are
made on how to keep a disagreement from becoming an
argument:
Welcome the disagreement. Remember the slogan, “When
two partners always agree, one of them is not necessary.” If
there is some point you haven’t thought about, be thankful
if it is brought to your attention. Perhaps this disagreement
is your opportunity to be corrected before you make a serious
mistake.
Distrust your first instinctive impression. Our first natural
reaction in a disagreeable situation is to be defensive. Be
careful. Keep calm and watch out for your first reaction. It
may be you at your worst, not your best.
Control your temper. Remember, you can measure the size
of a person by what makes him or her angry.
Listen first.Give your opponents a chance to talk. Let them
finish. Do not resist, defend or debate. This only raises barriers.
Try to build bridges of understanding. Don’t build
higher barriers of misunderstanding.
Look for areas of agreement.When you have heard your
opponents out, dwell first on the points and areas on which
you agree.
Be honest, Look for areas where you can admit error and
say so. Apologize for your mistakes. It will help disarm your
opponents and reduce defensiveness.
Promise to think over your opponents’ ideas and study
them carefully. And mean it. Your opponents may be right.
It is a lot easier at this stage to agree to think about their
points than to move rapidly ahead and find yourself in a
position where your opponents can say: “We tried to tell
you, but you wouldn’t listen.”
Thank your opponents sincerely for their interest. Anyone
who takes the time to disagree with you is interested in the
same things you are. Think of them as people who really
want to help you, and you may turn your opponents into
friends.
Postpone action to give both sides time to think through
the problem. Suggest that a new meeting be held later that
day or the next day, when all the facts may be brought to bear. In preparation for this meeting, ask yourself some hard questions:
Could my opponents be right? Partly right? Is there truth
or merit in their position or argument? Is my reaction one
that will relieve the problem, or will it just relieve any frustration?
Will my reaction drive my opponents further away
or draw them closer to me? Will my reaction elevate the
estimation good people have of me? Will I win or lose?
What price will I have to pay if I win? If I am quiet about it,
will the disagreement blow over? Is this difficult situation
an opportunity for me?</li></ul><ul><li>Bits and Pieces, published by The Economics Press, Fairfield, N.J.
Opera tenor Jan Peerce, after he was married nearly
fifty years, once said: &quot;My wife and I made a pact a long
time ago, and we’ve kept it no matter how angry we’ve
grown with each other. When one yells, the other should
listen-because when two people yell, there is no communication,
just noise and bad vibrations.”PRINCIPLE 1
The only way to get the best of an argument
is to avoid it.
A SURE WAY OF MAKING ENEMIES-AND HOW TO AVOID IT
When Theodore Roosevelt was in the White House, he
confessed that if he could be right 75 percent of the time,
he would reach the highest measure of his expectation.
If that was the highest rating that one of the most distinguished
men of the twentieth century could hope to
obtain, what about you and me?
If you can be sure of being right only 55 percent of the
time, you can go down to Wall Street and make a million
dollars a day. If you can’t be sure of being right even 55
percent of the time, why should you tell other people
they are wrong?
You can tell people they are wrong by a look or an
intonation or a gesture just as eloquently as you can in
words - and if you tell them they are wrong, do you
make them want to agree with you? Never! For you have
struck a direct blow at their intelligence, judgment,
pride and self-respect. That will make them want to
strike back. But it will never make them want to change
their minds. You may then hurl at them all the logic of a
Plato or an Immanuel Kant, but you will not alter their
opinions, for you have hurt their feelings.
Never begin by announcing &quot;I am going to prove so-and-
so to you.” That’s bad. That’s tantamount to saying:
“I’m smarter than you are, I’m going to tell you a thing
or two and make you change your mind.”
That is a challenge. It arouses opposition and makes
the listener want to battle with you before you even
start.
It is difficult, under even the most benign conditions,
to change people’s minds. So why make it harder? Why
handicap yourself?
If you are going to prove anything, don’t let anybody
know it. Do it so subtly, so adroitly, that no one will feel
that you are doing it. This was expressed succinctly by
Alexander Pope:
Men must be taught as if you taught them not
And things unknown proposed as things forgot.
Over three hundred years ago Galileo said:
You cannot teach a man anything; you can only
help him to find it within himself.
As Lord Chesterfield said to his son:
Be wiser than other people if you can;
but do not tell them so.
Socrates said repeatedly to his followers in Athens:
One thing only I know, and that
is that I know nothing.
Well, I can’t hope to be any smarter than Socrates, so
I have quit telling people they are wrong. And I find that
it pays.
If a person makes a statement that you think is wrong</li></ul><ul><li>yes, even that you know is wrong - isn’t it better to
begin by saying: “Well, now, look, I thought otherwise,
but I may be wrong. I frequently am. And if I am wrong,
I want to be put right. Let’s examine the facts.”
There’s magic, positive magic, in such phrases as: &quot;I
may be wrong. I frequently am. Let’s examine the facts.”
Nobody in the heavens above or on earth beneath
or in the waters under the earth will ever object to your
saying: &quot;I may be wrong. Let’s examine the facts.”
One of our class members who used this approach in
dealing with customers was Harold Reinke, a Dodge
dealer in Billings, Montana. He reported that because of
the pressures of the automobile business, he was often
hard-boiled and callous when dealing with customers’
complaints. This caused flared tempers, loss of business
and general unpleasantness.
He told his class: “Recognizing that this was getting
me nowhere fast, I tried a new tack. I would say something
like this: ‘Our dealership has made so many mistakes
that I am frequently ashamed. We may have erred
in your case. Tell me about it.’
“This approach becomes quite disarming, and by the
time the customer releases his feelings, he is usually
much more reasonable when it comes to settling the
matter. In fact, several customers have thanked me for
having such an understanding attitude. And two of them
have even brought in friends to buy new cars. In this
highly competitive market, we need more of this type of
customer, and I believe that showing respect for all customers’
opinions and treating them diplomatically and
courteously will help beat the competition.”
You will never get into trouble by admitting that you
may be wrong. That will stop all argument and inspire
your opponent to be just as fair and open and broad-minded
as you are. It will make him want to admit that
he, too, may be wrong.
If you know positively that a person is wrong, and you
bluntly tell him or her so, what happens? Let me illustrate.
Mr. S---- a young New York attorney, once argued
a rather important case before the United States
Supreme Court (Lustgarten v. Fleet Corporation 280
U.S. 320). The case involved a considerable sum of
money and an important question of law. During the
argument, one of the Supreme Court justices said to him:
“The statute of limitations in admiralty law is six years,
is it not?”
Mr. S---- stopped, stared at the Justice for a moment,
and then said bluntly: “Your Honor, there is no statute
of limitations in admiralty.”
&quot;A hush fell on the court,” said Mr. S---- as he related
his experience to one of the author’s classes, “and the
temperature in the room seemed to drop to zero. I was
right. Justice - was wrong. And I had told him so. But
did that make him friendly? No. I still believe that I had
the law on my side. And I know that I spoke better than
I ever spoke before. But I didn’t persuade. I made the
enormous blunder of telling a very learned and famous
man that he was wrong.”
Few people are logical. Most of us are prejudiced and
biased. Most of us are blighted with preconceived notions,
with jealousy, suspicion, fear, envy and pride. And
most citizens don’t want to change their minds about
their religion or their haircut or communism or their favorite
movie star. So, if you are inclined to tell people
they are wrong, please read the following paragraph
every morning before breakfast. It is from James Harvey
Robinson’s enlightening book The Mind in the Making.
We sometimes find ourselves changing our minds without
any resistance or heavy emotion, but if we are told we
are wrong, we resent the imputation and harden our hearts.
We are incredibly heedless in the formation of our beliefs,
but find ourselves filled with an illicit passion for them
when anyone proposes to rob us of their companionship. It
is obviously not the ideas themselves that are dear to us,
but our self-esteem which is threatened. . . . The little word
“my” is the most important one in human affairs, and properly
to reckon with it is the beginning of wisdom. It has the
same force whether it is “my” dinner, “my” dog, and &quot;my&quot;
house, or “my” father, “my” country, and “my” God. We
not only resent the imputation that our watch is wrong, or
our car shabby, but that our conception of the canals of
Mars, of the pronunciation of “Epictetus,” of the medicinal
value of salicin, or of the date of Sargon I is subject to revision.
We like to continue to believe what we have been
accustomed to accept as true, and the resentment aroused
when doubt is cast upon any of our assumptions leads us to
seek every manner of excuse for clinging to it. The result is
that most of our so-called reasoning consists in finding arguments
for going on believing as we already do.
Carl Rogers, the eminent psychologist, wrote in his
book On Becoming a Person:
I have found it of enormous value when I can permit
myself to understand the other person. The way in which I
have worded this statement may seem strange to you, Is it
necessary to permit oneself to understand another? I think
it is. Our first reaction to most of the statements (which we
hear from other people) is an evaluation or judgment, rather
than an understanding of it. When someone expresses some
feeling, attitude or belief, our tendency is almost immediately
to feel “that’s right,” or “that’s stupid,” “that’s abnormal,”
“that’s unreasonable,” “that’s incorrect,” “that’s not
nice .&quot; Very rarely do we permit ourselves to understand
precisely what the meaning of the statement is to the other
person.*</li></ul><ul><li>Adapted from Carl R. Rogers, On Becoming a Person (Boston: Houghton
Mifflin, 1961), pp. 18ff.
I once employed an interior decorator to make some
draperies for my home. When the bill arrived, I was
dismayed.
A few days later, a friend dropped in and looked at the
draperies. The price was mentioned, and she exclaimed
with a note of triumph: “What? That’s awful. I am afraid
he put one over on you.”
True? Yes, she had told the truth, but few people like
to listen to truths that reflect on their judgment. So,
being human, I tried to defend myself. I pointed out that
the best is eventually the cheapest, that one can’t expect
to get quality and artistic taste at bargain-basement
prices, and so on and on.
The next day another friend dropped in, admired the
draperies, bubbled over with enthusiasm, and expressed
a wish that she could afford such exquisite creations for
her home. My reaction was totally different. “Well, to
tell the truth,” I said, &quot;I can’t afford them myself. I paid
too much. I’m sorry I ordered them,”
When we are wrong, we may admit it to ourselves.
And if we are handled gently and tactfully, we may
admit it to others and even take pride in our frankness
and broad-mindedness. But not if someone else is trying
to ram the unpalatable fact down our esophagus.
Horace Greeley, the most famous editor in America
during the time of the Civil War, disagreed violently
with Lincoln’s policies. He believed that he could drive
Lincoln into agreeing with him by a campaign of argument,
ridicule and abuse. He waged this bitter campaign
month after month, year after year. In fact, he wrote a
brutal, bitter, sarcastic and personal attack on President
Lincoln the night Booth shot him.
But did all this bitterness make Lincoln agree with
Greeley? Not at all. Ridicule and abuse never do.
If you want some excellent suggestions about dealing
with people and managing yourself and improving your
personality, read Benjamin Franklin’s autobiography -
one of the most fascinating life stories ever written, one
of the classics of American literature. Ben Franklin tells
how he conquered the iniquitous habit of argument and
transformed himself into one of the most able, suave and
diplomatic men in American history.
One day, when Ben Franklin was a blundering youth,
an old Quaker friend took him aside and lashed him with
a few stinging truths, something like this:
Ben, you are impossible. Your opinions have a slap in
them for everyone who differs with you. They have become
so offensive that nobody cares for them. Your friends find
they enjoy themselves better when you are not around. You
know so much that no man can tell you anything. Indeed,
no man is going to try, for the effort would lead only to
discomfort and hard work. So you are not likely ever to
know any more than you do now, which is very little.
One of the finest things I know about Ben Franklin is
the way he accepted that smarting rebuke. He was big
enough and wise enough to realize that it was true, to
sense that he was headed for failure and social disaster.
So he made a right-about-face. He began immediately to
change his insolent, opinionated ways.
&quot;I made it a rule,” said Franklin, “to forbear all direct
contradiction to the sentiment of others, and all positive
assertion of my own, I even forbade myself the use of
every word or expression in the language that imported
a fix’d opinion, such as ‘certainly,’ ‘undoubtedly,’ etc.,
and I adopted, instead of them, ‘I conceive,’ ‘I apprehend,
’ or ‘I imagine’ a thing to be so or so, or ‘it so
appears to me at present.’ When another asserted something
that I thought an error, I deny’d myself the pleasure
of contradicting him abruptly, and of showing
immediately some absurdity in his proposition: and in
answering I began by observing that in certain cases or
circumstances his opinion would be right, but in the
present case there appear’d or seem’d to me some difference,
etc. I soon found the advantage of this change in
my manner; the conversations I engag’d in went on more
pleasantly. The modest way in which I propos’d my
opinions procur&#x27;d them a readier reception and less contradiction;
I had less mortification when I was found to
be in the wrong, and I more easily prevaile&#x27;d with others
to give up their mistakes and join with me when I happened
to be in the right.
“And this mode, which I at first put on with some
violence to natural inclination, became at length so easy,
and so habitual to me, that perhaps for these fifty years
past no one has ever heard a dogmatical expression escape
me. And to this habit (after my character of integrity)
I think it principally owing that I had earned so
much weight with my fellow citizens when I proposed
new institutions, or alterations in the old, and so much
influence in public councils when I became a member;
for I was but a bad speaker, never eloquent, subject to
much hesitation in my choice of words, hardly correct in
language, and yet I generally carried my points.”
How do Ben Franklin’s methods work in business?
Let’s take two examples.
Katherine A, Allred of Kings Mountain, North Carolina,
is an industrial engineering supervisor for a yarn-processing
plant. She told one of our classes how she
handled a sensitive problem before and after taking our
training:
“Part of my responsibility,” she reported, “deals with
setting up and maintaining incentive systems and standards
for our operators so they can make more money by
producing more yarn. The system we were using had
worked fine when we had only two or three different
types of yarn, but recently we had expanded our inventory
and capabilities to enable us to run more than
twelve different varieties. The present system was no
longer adequate to pay the operators fairly for the work
being performed and give them an incentive to increase
production. I had worked up a new system which would
enable us to pay the operator by the class of yam she
was running at any one particular time. With my new
system in hand, I entered the meeting determined to
prove to the management that my system was the right
approach. I told them in detail how they were wrong
and showed where they were being unfair and how I
had all the answers they needed. To say the least, I
failed miserably! I had become so busy defending my
position on the new system that I had left them no opening
to graciously admit their problems on the old one.
The issue was dead.
“After several sessions of this course, I realized all too
well where I had made my mistakes. I called another
meeting and this time I asked where they felt their problems
were. We discussed each point, and I asked them
their opinions on which was the best way to proceed.
With a few low-keyed suggestions, at proper intervals, I
let them develop my system themselves. At the end of
the meeting when I actually presented my system, they
enthusiastically accepted it.
&quot;I am convinced now that nothing good is accomplished
and a lot of damage can be done if you tell a
person straight out that he or she is wrong. You only
succeed in stripping that person of self-dignity and making
yourself an unwelcome part of any discussion.”
Let’s take another example - and remember these
cases I am citing are typical of the experiences of thousands
of other people. R. V. Crowley was a salesman for
a lumber company in New York. Crowley admitted that
he had been telling hard-boiled lumber inspectors for
years that they were wrong. And he had won the arguments
too. But it hadn’t done any good. “For these lumber
inspectors,” said Mr. Crowley, &quot;are like baseball
umpires. Once they make a decision, they never change
it,”
Mr. Crowley saw that his firm was losing thousands of
dollars through the arguments he won. So while taking
my course, he resolved to change tactics and abandon
arguments. With what results? Here is the story as he
told it to the fellow members of his class:
“One morning the phone rang in my office. A hot and
bothered person at the other end proceeded to inform
me that a car of lumber we had shipped into his plant
was entirely unsatisfactory. His firm had stopped unloading
and requested that we make immediate arrangements
to remove the stock from their yard. After about
one-fourth of the car had been unloaded, their lumber
inspector reported that the lumber was running 55 percent
below grade. Under the circumstances, they refused
to accept it.
&quot;I immediately started for his plant and on the way
turned over in my mind the best way to handle the situation.
Ordinarily, under such circumstances, I should
have quoted grading rules and tried, as a result of my
own experience and knowledge as a lumber inspector,
to convince the other inspector that the lumber was actually
up to grade, and that he was misinterpreting the
rules in his inspection. However, I thought I would
apply the principles learned in this training.
“When I arrived at the plant, I found the purchasing
agent and the lumber inspector in a wicked humor, both
set for an argument and a fight. We walked out to the car
that was being unloaded, and I requested that they continue
to unload so that I could see how things were
going. I asked the inspector to go right ahead and lay out
the rejects, as he had been doing, and to put the good
pieces in another pile.
“After watching him for a while it began to dawn on
me that his inspection actually was much too strict and
that he was misinterpreting the rules. This particular
lumber was white pine, and I knew the inspector was
thoroughly schooled in hard woods but not a competent,
experienced inspector on white pine. White pine happened
to be my own strong suit, but did I offer any
objection to the way he was grading the lumber? None
whatever. I kept on watching and gradually began to ask
questions as to why certain pieces were not satisfactory.
I didn’t for one instant insinuate that the inspector was
wrong. I emphasized that my only reason for asking was
in order that we could give his firm exactly what they
wanted in future shipments. wanted in future shipments.
“By asking questions in a very friendly, cooperative
spirit, and insisting continually that they were right in
laying out boards not satisfactory to their purpose, I got
him warmed up, and the strained relations between us
began to thaw and melt away. An occasional carefully
put remark on my part gave birth to the idea in his mind
that possibly some of these rejected pieces were actually
within the grade that they had bought, and that their
requirements demanded a more expensive grade. I was
very careful, however, not to let him think I was making
an issue of this point.
“Gradually his whole attitude changed. He finally admitted
to me that he was not experienced on white pine
and began to ask me questions about each piece as it
came out of the car, I would explain why such a piece
came within the grade specified, but kept on insisting
that we did not want him to take it if it was unsuitable
for their purpose. He finally got to the point where he
felt guilty every time he put a piece in the rejected pile.
And at last he saw that the mistake was on their part for
not having specified as good a grade as they needed.
“The ultimate outcome was that he went through the
entire carload again after I left, accepted the whole lot,
and we received a check in full.
“In that one instance alone, a little tact, and the determination
to refrain from telling the other man he was
wrong, saved my company a substantial amount of cash,
and it would be hard to place a money value on the good
will that was saved.”
Martin Luther King was asked how, as a pacifist, he
could be an admirer of Air Force General Daniel &quot;Chappie”
James, then the nation’s highest-ranking black officer.
Dr. King replied, &quot;I judge people by their own
principles - not by my own.”
In a similar way, General Robert E. Lee once spoke to
the president of the Confederacy, Jefferson Davis, in the
most glowing terms about a certain officer under his
command. Another officer in attendance was astonished.
“General,” he said, &quot; do you not know that the man of
whom you speak so highly is one of your bitterest enemies
who misses no opportunity to malign you?” &quot;Yes,&quot;
replied General Lee, “but the president asked my opinion
of him; he did not ask for his opinion of me.”
By the way, I am not revealing anything new in this
chapter. Two thousand years ago, Jesus said: “Agree
with thine adversary quickly.”
And 2,200 years before Christ was born, King Akhtoi
of Egypt gave his son some shrewd advice - advice that
is sorely needed today. “Be diplomatic,” counseled the
King. “It will help you gain your point.”
In other words, don’t argue with your customer or your
spouse or your adversary. Don’t tell them they are
wrong, don’t get them stirred up. Use a little diplomacy.
PRINCIPLE 2
Show respect for the other person’s opinions.
Never say, &quot;You&#x27;re wrong.”
IF YOU’RE WRONG, ADMIT ITWithin a minute’s walk of my house there was a wild
stretch of virgin timber, where the blackberry thickets
foamed white in the springtime, where the squirrels
nested and reared their young, and the horseweeds grew
as tall as a horse’s head. This unspoiled woodland was
called Forest Park - and it was a forest, probably not
much different in appearance from what it was when
Columbus discovered America. I frequently walked in
this park with Rex, my little Boston bulldog. He was a
friendly, harmless little hound; and since we rarely met
anyone in the park, I took Rex along without a leash or a
muzzle.
One day we encountered a mounted policeman in the
park, a policeman itching to show his authority.
“‘What do you mean by letting that dog run loose in
the park without a muzzle and leash?” he reprimanded
me. “Don’t you know it’s against the law?”
“Yes, I know it is,” I replied softy, “but I didn’t think
he would do any harm out here.”
&quot;You didn’t think! You didn’t think! The law doesn’t
give a tinker’s damn about what you think. That dog
might kill a squirrel or bite a child. Now, I’m going to let
you off this time; but if I catch this dog out here again
without a muzzle and a leash, you’ll have to tell it to the
judge .&quot;
I meekly promised to obey.
And I did obey - for a few times. But Rex didn’t like
the muzzle, and neither did I; so we decided to take a
chance. Everything was lovely for a while, and then we
struck a snag. Rex and I raced over the brow of a hill one
afternoon and there, suddenly - to my dismay - I saw
the majesty of the law, astride a bay horse. Rex was out
in front, heading straight for the officer.
I was in for it. I knew it. So I didn’t wait until the
policeman started talking. I beat him to it. I said: “Officer,
you’ve caught me red-handed. I’m guilty. I have no
alibis, no excuses. You warned me last week that if I
brought the dog out here again without a muzzle you
would fine me.”
&quot;Well, now,” the policeman responded in a soft tone.
“I know it’s a temptation to let a little dog like that have
a run out here when nobody is around.”
“Sure it’s a temptation,” I replied, “but it is against
the law.”
“Well, a little dog like that isn’t going to harm anybody,”
the policeman remonstrated.
&quot;No, but he may kill squirrels,” I said.
“Well now, I think you are taking this a bit too seriously,”
he told me. “I’ll tell you what you do. You just
let him run over the hill there where I can’t see him - and
we’ll forget all about it.”
That policeman, being human, wanted a feeling of importance;
so when I began to condemn myself, the only
way he could nourish his self-esteem was to take the
magnanimous attitude of showing mercy.
But suppose I had tried to defend myself - well, did
you ever argue with a policeman?
But instead of breaking lances with him, I admitted
that he was absolutely right and I was absolutely wrong;
I admitted it quickly, openly, and with enthusiasm. The
affair terminated graciously in my taking his side and his
taking my side. Lord Chesterfield himself could hardly
have been more gracious than this mounted policeman,
who, only a week previously, had threatened to have the
law on me.
If we know we are going to be rebuked anyhow, isn’t
it far better to beat the other person to it and do it ourselves?
Isn’t it much easier to listen to self-criticism than
to bear condemnation from alien lips?
Say about yourself all the derogatory things you know
the other person is thinking or wants to say or intends to
say - and say them before that person has a chance to
say them. The chances are a hundred to one that a generous,
forgiving attitude will be taken and your mistakes
will be minimized just as the mounted policeman did
with me and Rex.
Ferdinand E. Warren, a commercial artist, used this
technique to win the good will of a petulant, scolding
buyer of art.
“It is important, in making drawings for advertising
and publishing purposes, to be precise and very exact,”
Mr. Warren said as he told the story.
“Some art editors demand that their commissions be
executed immediately; and in these cases, some slight
error is liable to occur. I knew one art director in particular
who was always delighted to find fault with some
little thing. I have often left his office in disgust, not
because of the criticism, but because of his method of
attack. Recently I delivered a rush job to this editor, and
he phoned me to call at his office immediately. He said
something was wrong. When I arrived, I found just what
I had anticipated - and dreaded. He was hostile, gloating
over his chance to criticize. He demanded with heat
why I had done so and so. My opportunity had come to
apply the self-criticism I had been studying about. So I
said: &#x27;&#x27;Mr. So-and-so, if what you say is true, I am at fault
and there is absolutely no excuse for my blunder. I have
been doing drawings for you long enough to know bet-ter.
I’m ashamed of myself.’
“Immediately he started to defend me. ‘Yes, you’re
right, but after all, this isn’t a serious mistake. It is
only -&#x27;
&quot;I interrupted him. ‘Any mistake,’ I said, ‘may be
costly and they are all irritating.’
“He started to break in, but I wouldn’t let him. I was
having a grand time. For the first time in my life, I was
criticizing myself - and I loved it.
&quot; ‘I should have been more careful,’ I continued. ‘You
give me a lot of work, and you deserve the best; so I’m
going to do this drawing all over.’
&quot; ‘No! No!’ he protested. ‘I wouldn’t think of putting
you to all that trouble.’ He praised my work, assured me
that he wanted only a minor change and that my slight
error hadn’t cost his firm any money; and, after all, it was
a mere detail - not worth worrying about.
“My eagerness to criticize myself took all the fight out
of him. He ended up by taking me to lunch; and before
we parted, he gave me a check and another commission”
There is a certain degree of satisfaction in having the
courage to admit one’s errors. It not only clears the air of
guilt and defensiveness, but often helps solve the problem
created by the error.
Bruce Harvey of Albuquerque, New Mexico, had incorrectly
authorized payment of full wages to an employee
on sick leave. When he discovered his error, he
brought it to the attention of the employee and explained
that to correct the mistake he would have to
reduce his next paycheck by the entire amount of the
overpayment. The employee pleaded that as that would
cause him a serious financial problem, could the money
be repaid over a period of time? In order to do this,
Harvey explained, he would have to obtain his supervisor&#x27;s
approval. “And this I knew,” reported Harvey,
“would result in a boss-type explosion, While trying to
decide how to handle this situation better, I realized that
the whole mess was my fault and I would have to admit I
it to my boss.
“I walked into his office, told him that I had made a
mistake and then informed him of the complete facts.
He replied in an explosive manner that it was the fault
of the personnel department. I repeated that it was my
fault. He exploded again about carelessness in the accounting
department. Again I explained it was my fault.
He blamed two other people in the office. But each time
I reiterated it was my fault. Finally, he looked at me and
said, ‘Okay, it was your fault. Now straighten it out.’ The
error was corrected and nobody got into trouble. I felt
great because I was able to handle a tense situation and
had the courage not to seek alibis. My boss has had more
respect for me ever since.”
Any fool can try to defend his or her mistakes - and
most fools do - but it raises one above the herd and gives
one a feeling of nobility and exultation to admit one’s
mistakes. For example, one of the most beautiful things
that history records about Robert E. Lee is the way he
blamed himself and only himself for the failure of Pickett’s
charge at Gettysburg.
Pickett’s charge was undoubtedly the most brilliant
and picturesque attack that ever occurred in the Western
world. General George E. Pickett himself was picturesque.
He wore his hair so long that his auburn locks
almost touched his shoulders; and, like Napoleon in his
Italian campaigns, he wrote ardent love-letters almost
daily while on the battlefield. His devoted troops
cheered him that tragic July afternoon as he rode off
jauntily toward the Union lines, his cap set at a rakish
angle over his right ear. They cheered and they followed
him, man touching man, rank pressing rank, with banners
flying and bayonets gleaming in the sun. It was a
gallant sight. Daring. Magnificent. A murmur of admiration
ran through the Union lines as they beheld it.
Pickett’s troops swept forward at any easy trot, through
orchard and cornfield, across a meadow and over a ravine.
All the time, the enemy’s cannon was tearing
ghastly holes in their ranks, But on they pressed, grim,
irresistible.
Suddenly the Union infantry rose from behind the
stone wall on Cemetery Ridge where they had been hiding
and fired volley after volley into Pickett&#x27;s onrushing
troops. The crest of the hill was a sheet of flame, a
slaughterhouse, a blazing volcano. In a few minutes, all
of Pickett’s brigade commanders except one were down,
and four-fifths of his five thousand men had fallen.
General Lewis A. Armistead, leading the troops in the
final plunge, ran forward, vaulted over the stone wall,
and, waving his cap on the top of his sword, shouted:
“Give ‘em the steel, boys!”
They did. They leaped over the wall, bayoneted their
enemies, smashed skulls with clubbed muskets, and
planted the battleflags of the South on Cemetery Ridge.
The banners waved there only for a moment. But that
moment, brief as it was, recorded the high-water mark of
the Confederacy.
Pickett’s charge - brilliant, heroic - was nevertheless
the beginning of the end. Lee had failed. He could not
penetrate the North. And he knew it.
The South was doomed.
Lee was so saddened, so shocked, that he sent in his
resignation and asked Jefferson Davis, the president of
the Confederacy, to appoint &quot;a younger and abler man.”
If Lee had wanted to blame the disastrous failure of
Pickett’s charge on someone else, he could have found a
score of alibis. Some of his division commanders had
failed him. The cavalry hadn’t arrived in time to support
the infantry attack. This had gone wrong and that had
gone awry.
But Lee was far too noble to blame others. As Pickett’s
beaten and bloody troops struggled back to the Confederate
lines, Robert E. Lee rode out to meet them all
alone and greeted them with a self-condemnation that
was little short of sublime. “All this has been my fault,”
he confessed. &quot;I and I alone have lost this battle.”
Few generals in all history have had the courage and
character to admit that.
Michael Cheung, who teaches our course in Hong
Kong, told of how the Chinese culture presents some
special problems and how sometimes it is necessary to
recognize that the benefit of applying a principle may be
more advantageous than maintaining an old tradition.
He had one middle-aged class member who had been
estranged from his son for many years. The father had
been an opium addict, but was now cured. In Chinese
tradition an older person cannot take the first step. The
father felt that it was up to his son to take the initiative
toward a reconciliation. In an early session, he told the
class about the grandchildren he had never seen and
how much he desired to be reunited with his son. His
classmates, all Chinese, understood his conflict between
his desire and long-established tradition. The father felt
that young people should have respect for their elders
and that he was right in not giving in to his desire, but to
wait for his son to come to him.
Toward the end of the course the father again addressed
his class. “I have pondered this problem,” he
said. “Dale Carnegie says, ‘If you are wrong, admit it
quickly and emphatically.’ It is too late for me to admit
it quickly, but I can admit it emphatically. I wronged my
son. He was right in not wanting to see me and to expel
me from his life. I may lose face by asking a younger
person’s forgiveness, but I was at fault and it is my responsibility
to admit this.” The class applauded and
gave him their full support. At the next class he told how
he went to his son’s house, asked for and received forgiveness
and was now embarked on a new relationship
with his son, his daughter-in-law and the grandchildren
he had at last met.
Elbert Hubbard was one of the most original authors
who ever stirred up a nation, and his stinging sentences
often aroused fierce resentment. But Hubbard with his
rare skill for handling people frequently turned his enemies
into friends.
For example, when some irritated reader wrote in to
say that he didn’t agree with such and such an article
and ended by calling Hubbard this and that, Elbert Hubbard
would answer like this:
Come to think it over, I don’t entirely agree with it myself.
Not everything I wrote yesterday appeals to me today. I am
glad to learn what you think on the subject. The next time
you are in the neighborhood you must visit us and we’ll get
this subject threshed out for all time. So here is a handclasp
over the miles, and I am,
Your sincerely,
What could you say to a man who treated you like
that?
When we are right, let’s try to win people gently and
tactfully to our way of thinking, and when we are wrong</li></ul><ul><li>and that will be surprisingly often, if we are honest
with ourselves - let’s admit our mistakes quickly and
with enthusiasm. Not only will that technique produce
astonishing results; but, believe it or not, it is a lot more
fun, under the circumstances, than trying to defend oneself.
Remember the old proverb: &quot;By fighting you never
get enough, but by yielding you get more than you expected.”
PRINCIPLE 3
If you are wrong, admit it quickly and
emphatically.
A DROP OF HONEY
If your temper is aroused and you tell ‘em a thing or two,
you will have a fine time unloading your feelings. But
what about the other person? Will he share your pleasure?
Will your belligerent tones, your hostile attitude,
make it easy for him to agree with you?
“If you come at me with your fists doubled,” said
Woodrow Wilson, “I think I can promise you that mine
will double as fast as yours; but if you come to me and
say, ‘Let us sit down and take counsel together, and, if
we differ from each other, understand why it is that we
differ, just what the points at issue are,’ we will presently
find that we are not so far apart after all, that the
points on which we differ are few and the points on
which we agree are many, and that if we only have the
patience and the candor and the desire to get together,
we will get together.”
Nobody appreciated the truth of Woodrow Wilson’s
statement more than John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Back in
1915, Rockefeller was the most fiercely despised man in
Colorado, One of the bloodiest strikes in the history of
American industry had been shocking the state for two
terrible years. Irate, belligerent miners were demanding
higher wages from the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company;
Rockefeller controlled that company. Property had
been destroyed, troops had been called out. Blood had
been shed. Strikers had been shot, their bodies riddled
with bullets.
At a time like that, with the air seething with hatred,
Rockefeller wanted to win the strikers to his way of
thinking. And he did it. How? Here’s the story. After
weeks spent in making friends, Rockefeller addressed
the representatives of the strikers. This speech, in its
entirety, is a masterpiece. It produced astonishing results.
It calmed the tempestuous waves of hate that
threatened to engulf Rockefeller. It won him a host of
admirers. It presented facts in such a friendly manner
that the strikers went back to work without saying another
word about the increase in wages for which they
had fought so violently.
The opening of that remarkable speech follows. Note
how it fairly glows with friendliness. Rockefeller, remember,
was talking to men who, a few days previously,
had wanted to hang him by the neck to a sour apple tree;
yet he couldn’t have been more gracious, more friendly
if he had addressed a group of medical missionaries. His
speech was radiant with such phrases as I am proud to
be here, having visited in your homes, met many of your
wives and children, we meet here not as strangers, but
as friends . . . spirit of mutual friendship, our common
interests, it is only by your courtesy that I am here.
“This is a red-letter day in my life,” Rockefeller
began. “It is the first time I have ever had the good
fortune to meet the representatives of the employees of
this great company, its officers and superintendents, together,
and I can assure you that I am proud to be here,
and that I shall remember this gathering as long as I live.
Had this meeting been held two weeks ago, I should
have stood here a stranger to most of you, recognizing a
few faces. Having had the opportunity last week of
visiting all the camps in the southern coal field and
of talking individually with practically all of the
representatives, except those who were away; having
visited in your homes, met many of your wives and children,
we meet here not as strangers, but as friends, and
it is in that spirit of mutual friendship that I am glad to
have this opportunity to discuss with you our common
interests.
“Since this is a meeting of the officers of the company
and the representatives of the employees, it is only by
your courtesy that I am here, for I am not so fortunate as
to be either one or the other; and yet I feel that I am
intimately associated with you men, for, in a sense, I
represent both the stockholders and the directors.”
Isn’t that a superb example of the fine art of making
friends out of enemies?
Suppose Rockefeller had taken a different tack. Suppose
he had argued with those miners and hurled devastating
facts in their faces. Suppose he had told them by
his tones and insinuations that they were wrong Suppose
that, by all the rules of logic, he had proved that
they were wrong. What would have happened? More
anger would have been stirred up, more hatred, more
revolt.
If a man&#x27;s heart is rankling with discord and ill feeling
toward you, you can’t win him to your way of thinking
with all the logic in Christendom. Scolding parents
and domineering bosses and husbands and nagging
wives ought to realize that people don’t want to change
their minds. They can’t he forced or driven to agree
with you or me. But they may possibly be led to, if we
are gentle and friendly, ever so gentle and ever so
friendly.
Lincoln said that, in effect, over a hundred years ago.
Here are his words:
It is an old and true maxim that &quot;a drop of honey catches
more flies than a gallon of gall.&quot; So with men, if you would
win a man to you cause, first convince him that you are his
sincere friend. Therein is a drop of honey that catches his
heart; which, say what you will, is the great high road to
his reason.
Business executives have learned that it pays to be
friendly to strikers. For example, when 2,500 employees
in the White Motor Company’s plant struck for higher
wages and a union shop, Robert F. Black, then president
of the company, didn’t lose his temper and condemn and
threaten and talk of tryanny and Communists. He actually
praised the strikers. He published an advertisement
in the Cleveland papers, complimenting them on
“the peaceful way in which they laid down their tools.”
Finding the strike pickets idle, he bought them a couple
of dozen baseball bats and gloves and invited them to
play ball on vacant lots. For those who preferred bowling,
he rented a bowling alley.
This friendliness on Mr. Black’s part did what friendliness
always does: it begot friendliness. So the strikers
borrowed brooms, shovels, and rubbish carts, and began
picking up matches, papers, cigarette stubs, and cigar
butts around the factory. Imagine it! Imagine strikers
tidying up the factory grounds while battling for higher
wages and recognition of the union. Such an event had
never been heard of before in the long, tempestuous
history of American labor wars. That strike ended with a
compromise settlement within a week-ended without
any ill feeling or rancor.
Daniel Webster, who looked like a god and talked like
Jehovah, was one of the most successful advocates who
ever pleaded a case; yet he ushered in his most powerful
arguments with such friendly remarks as: “It will be for
the jury to consider,” “This may perhaps be worth
thinking of,” &quot; Here are some facts that I trust you will
not lose sight of,” or “You, with your knowledge of
human nature, will easily see the significance of these
facts.” No bulldozing. No high-pressure methods. No attempt
to force his opinions on others. Webster used the
soft-spoken, quiet, friendly approach, and it helped to
make him famous.
You may never be called upon to settle a strike or
address a jury, but you may want to get your rent reduced.
Will the friendly approach help you then? Let’s
see.</li></ul><ol start="0"><li>L. Straub, an engineer, wanted to get his rent reduced.
And he knew his landlord was hard-boiled. &quot;I
wrote him,” Mr. Straub said in a speech before the class,
“notifying him that I was vacating my apartment as soon
as my lease expired. The truth was, I didn’t want to
move. I wanted to stay if I could get my rent reduced.
But the situation seemed hopeless. Other tenants had
tried - and failed. Everyone told me that the landlord
was extremely difficult to deal with. But I said to myself,
‘I am studying a course in how to deal with people, so
I’ll try it on him - and see how it works.’
“He and his secretary came to see me as soon as he
got my letter. I met him at the door with a friendly greeting.
I fairly bubbled with good will and enthusiasm. I
didn’t begin talking about how high the rent was. I
began talking about how much I liked his apartment
house. Believe me, I was ‘hearty in my approbation and
lavish in my praise.&#x27; I complimented him on the way he
ran the building and told him I should like so much to
stay for another year but I couldn’t afford it.
“He had evidently never had such a reception from a
tenant. He hardly knew what to make of it.
“Then he started to tell me his troubles. Complaining
tenants. One had written him fourteen letters, some of
them positively insulting. Another threatened to break
his lease unless the landlord kept the man on the floor
above from snoring. ‘What a relief it is,’ he said, ‘to have
a satisfied tenant like you.’ And then, without my even
asking him to do it, he offered to reduce my rent a little.
I wanted more, so I named the figure I could afford to
pay, and he accepted without a word.
“As he was leaving, he turned to me and asked, ‘What
decorating can I do for you?’
“If I had tried to get the rent reduced by the methods
the other tenants were using, I am positive I should have
met with the same failure they encountered. It was the
friendly, sympathetic, appreciative approach that won.”
Dean Woodcock of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is the
superintendent of a department of the local electric company.
His staff was called upon to repair some equipment
on top of a pole. This type of work had formerly
been performed by a different department and had only
recently been transferred to Woodcock’s section Although
his people had been trained in the work, this was
the first time they had ever actually been called upon to
do it. Everybody in the organization was interested in
seeing if and how they could handle it. Mr. Woodcock,
several of his subordinate managers, and members of
other departments of the utility went to see the operation.
Many cars and trucks were there, and a number of
people were standing around watching the two lone
men on top of the pole.
Glancing around, Woodcock noticed a man up the
street getting out of his car with a camera. He began
taking pictures of the scene. Utility people are extremely
conscious of public relations, and suddenly Woodcock
realized what this setup looked like to the man with the
camera - overkill, dozens of people being called out to
do a two-person job. He strolled up the street to the
photographer.
&quot;I see you’re interested in our operation.”
“Yes, and my mother will be more than interested.
She owns stock in your company. This will be an eye-opener
for her. She may even decide her investment was
unwise. I’ve been telling her for years there’s a lot of
waste motion in companies like yours. This proves it.
The newspapers might like these pictures, too.”
“It does look like it, doesn’t it? I’d think the same
thing in your position. But this is a unique situation, . . .”
and Dean Woodcock went on to explain how
this was the first job of this type for his department and
how everybody from executives down was interested.
He assured the man that under normal conditions two
people could handle the job. The photographer put away
his camera, shook Woodcock’s hand, and thanked him
for taking the time to explain the situation to him.
Dean Woodcock’s friendly approach saved his company
much embarrassment and bad publicity.
Another member of one of our classes, Gerald H. Winn
of Littleton, New Hampshire, reported how by using a
friendly approach, he obtained a very satisfactory settlement
on a damage claim.
“Early in the spring,” he reported, “before the ground
had thawed from the winter freezing, there was an unusually
heavy rainstorm and the water, which normally
would have run off to nearby ditches and storm drains
along the road, took a new course onto a building lot
where I had just built a new home.
“Not being able to run off, the water pressure built up
around the foundation of the house. The water forced
itself under the concrete basement floor, causing it to
explode, and the basement filled with water. This ruined
the furnace and the hot-water heater. The cost to repair
this damage was in excess of two thousand dollars. I had
no insurance to cover this type of damage.
“However, I soon found out that the owner of the subdivision
had neglected to put in a storm drain near the
house which could have prevented this problem I made
an appointment to see him. During the twenty-five-mile
trip to his office, I carefully reviewed the situation and,
remembering the principles I learned in this course, I
decided that showing my anger would not serve any
worthwhile purpose, When I arrived, I kept very calm
and started by talking about his recent vacation to the
West Indies; then, when I felt the timing was right, I
mentioned the ‘little’ problem of water damage. He
quickly agreed to do his share in helping to correct the
problem.
“A few days later he called and said he would pay for
the damage and also put in a storm drain to prevent the
same thing from happening in the future.
“Even though it was the fault of the owner of the subdivision,
if I had not begun in a friendly way, there
would have been a great deal of difficulty in getting him
to agree to the total liability.”
Years ago, when I was a barefoot boy walking through
the woods to a country school out in northwest Missouri,
I read a fable about the sun and the wind. They quarreled
about which was the stronger, and the wind said,
&quot;I&#x27;ll prove I am. See the old man down there with a
coat? I bet I can get his coat off him quicker than you
can.”
So the sun went behind a cloud, and the wind blew
until it was almost a tornado, but the harder it blew, the
tighter the old man clutched his coat to him.
Finally, the wind calmed down and gave up, and then
the sun came out from behind the clouds and smiled
kindly on the old man. Presently, he mopped his brow
and pulled off his coat. The sun then told the wind that
gentleness and friendliness were always stronger than
fury and force.
The use of gentleness and friendliness is demonstrated
day after day by people who have learned that a
drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.
F. Gale Connor of Lutherville, Maryland, proved this
when he had to take his four-month-old car to the service
department of the car dealer for the third time. He told
our class: “It was apparent that talking to, reasoning with
or shouting at the service manager was not going to lead
to a satisfactory resolution of my problems.
“I walked over to the showroom and asked to see the
agency owner, Mr. White. After a short wait, I was ushered
into Mr. White’s office. I introduced myself and
explained to him that I had bought my car from his
dealership because of the recommendations of friends
who had had previous dealings with him. I was told that
his prices were very competitive and his service was
outstanding. He smiled with satisfaction as he listened
to me. I then explained the problem I was having with
the service department. ‘I thought you might want to be
aware of any situation that might tarnish your fine reputation,’
I added. He thanked me for calling this to his
attention and assured me that my problem would be
taken care of. Not only did he personal get involved,
but he also lent me his car to use while mine was being
repaired.”
Aesop was a Greek slave who lived at the court of
Croesus and spun immortal fables six hundred years before
Christ. Yet the truths he taught about human nature
are just as true in Boston and Birmingham now as they
were twenty-six centuries ago in Athens. The sun can
make you take off your coat more quickly than the wind;
and kindliness, the friendly approach and appreciation
can make people change their minds more readily than
all the bluster and storming in the world.
Remember what Lincoln said: “A drop of honey
catches more flies than a gallon of gall.”
PRINCIPLE 4Begin in a friendly way.THE SECRET OF SOCRATES
In talking with people, don’t begin by discussing the
things on which you differ. Begin by emphasizing - and
keep on emphasizing - the things on which you agree.
Keep emphasizing, if possible, that you are both striving
for the same end and that your only difference is one of
method and not of purpose.
Get the other person saying “Yes, yes” at the outset.
Keep your opponent, if possible, from saying “No.”
A “No” response, according to Professor Overstreet,*
is a most difficult handicap to overcome. When you have
said “No,” all your pride of personality demands that
you remain consistent with yourself. You may later feel
that the “No” was ill-advised; nevertheless, there is your
precious pride to consider! Once having said a thing,
you feel you must stick to it. Hence it is of the very
greatest importance that a person be started in the affirmative
direction.</li></ol><ul><li>Harry A. Overstreet, lnfluencing Humun Behavior (New York: Norton,
1925).
The skillful speaker gets, at the outset, a number of
“Yes” responses. This sets the psychological process of
the listeners moving in the affirmative direction. It is
like the movement of a billiard ball. Propel in one direction,
and it takes some force to deflect it; far more force
to send it back in the opposite direction.
The psychological patterns here are quite clear. When
a person says “No” and really means it, he or she is
doing far more than saying a word of two letters. The
entire organism - glandular, nervous, muscular -
gathers itself together into a condition of rejection. There is,
usually in minute but sometimes in observable degree,
a physical withdrawal or readiness for withdrawal. The
whole neuromuscular system, in short, sets itself on
guard against acceptance. When, to the contrary, a person
says “Yes,” none of the withdrawal activities takes
place. The organism is in a forward - moving, accepting,
open attitude. Hence the more “Yeses” we can, at the
very outset, induce, the more likely we are to succeed in
capturing the attention for our ultimate proposal.
It is a very simple technique - this yes response. And
yet, how much it is neglected! It often seems as if people
get a sense of their own importance by antagonizing others
at the outset.
Get a student to say “No” at the beginning, or a customer,
child, husband, or wife, and it takes the wisdom
and the patience of angels to transform that bristling
negative into an affirmative.
The use of this “yes, yes” technique enabled James
Eberson, who was a teller in the Greenwich Savings
Bank, in New York City, to secure a prospective customer
who might otherwise have been lost.
“This man came in to open an account,” said Mr.
Eberson, “and I gave him our usual form to fill out. Some
of the questions he answered willingly, but there were
others he flatly refused to answer.
“Before I began the study of human relations, I would
have told this prospective depositor that if he refused to
give the bank this information, we should have to refuse
to accept this account. I am ashamed that I have been
guilty of doing that very thing in the past. Naturally, an
ultimatum like that made me feel good. I had shown
who was boss, that the bank’s rules and regulations
couldn’t be flouted. But that sort of attitude certainly
didn’t give a feeling of welcome and importance to the
man who had walked in to give us his patronage.
“I resolved this morning to use a little horse sense. I
resolved not to talk about what the bank wanted but
about what the customer wanted. And above all else, I
was determined to get him saying ‘yes, yes’ from the
very start. So I agreed with him. I told him the information
he refused to give was not absolutely necessary.
&quot; ‘However,’ I said, ‘suppose you have money in this
bank at your death. Wouldn’t you like to have the bank
transfer it to your next of kin, who is entitled to it according
to law?’
&quot; ‘Yes, of course,’ he replied.
&quot; ‘Don’t you think,’ I continued, ‘that it would be a
good idea to give us the name of your next of kin so that,
in the event of your death, we could carry out your
wishes without error or delay?’
“Again he said, ‘Yes.’
“The young man’s attitude softened and changed
when he realized that we weren’t asking for this information
for our sake but for his sake. Before leaving the
bank, this young man not only gave me complete information
about himself but he opened, at my suggestion,
a trust account, naming his mother as the beneficiary for
his account, and he had gladly answered all the questions
concerning his mother also.
&quot;I found that by getting him to say ‘yes, yes’ from the
outset, he forgot the issue at stake and was happy to do
all the things I suggested.”
Joseph Allison, a sales representative for Westinghouse
Electric Company, had this story to tell: “There
was a man in my territory that our company was most
eager to sell to. My predecessor had called on him for
ten years without selling anything When I took over the
territory, I called steadily for three years without getting
an order. Finally, after thirteen years of calls and sales
talk, we sold him a few motors. If these proved to be all
right, an order for several hundred more would follow.
Such was my expectation,
“Right? I knew they would be all right. So when I
called three weeks later, I was in high spirits.
“The chief engineer greeted me with this shocking
announcement: ‘Allison, I can’t buy the remainder of the
motors from you.’
&quot; ‘Why?’ I asked in amazement. ‘Why?’
&quot; ‘Because your motors are too hot. I can’t put my hand
on them,’
&quot;I knew it wouldn’t do any good to argue. I had tried
that sort of thing too long. So I thought of getting the
&#x27;yes, yes&#x27; response.
&quot; ‘Well, now look, Mr. Smith,’ I said. ‘I agree with you
a hundred percent; if those motors are running too hot,
you ought not to buy any more of them. You must have
motors that won’t run any hotter than standards set by
the National Electrical Manufacturers Association. Isn’t
that so?’
“He agreed it was. I had gotten my first ‘yes.’
&quot; ‘The Electrical Manufacturers Association regulations
say that a properly designed motor may have a
temperature of 72 degrees Fahrenheit above room temperature.
Is that correct?’
&quot; ‘Yes,’ he agreed. ‘That’s quite correct. But your motors
are much hotter.’
&quot;I didn’t argue with him. I merely asked: ‘How hot is
the mill room?’
&quot; ‘Oh,’ he said, ‘about 75 degrees Fahrenheit.’
&quot; ‘Well,’ I replied, ‘if the mill room is 75 degrees and
you add 72 to that, that makes a total of 147 degrees
Fahrenheit. Wouldn’t you scald your hand if you held it
under a spigot of hot water at a temperature of 147 degrees
Fahrenheit?’
“Again he had to say ‘yes.’
&quot; ‘Well,’ I suggested, ‘wouldn’t it he a good idea to
keep your hands off those motors?’
&quot; ‘Well, I guess you’re right,’ he admitted. We continued
to chat for a while. Then he called his secretary and
lined up approximately $35,000 worth of business for
the ensuing month.
“It took me years and cost me countless thousands of
dollars in lost business before I finally learned that it
doesn’t pay to argue, that it is much more profitable and
much more interesting to look at things from the other
person’s viewpoint and try to get that person saying ‘yes, yes.&#x27; &quot;
Eddie Snow, who sponsors our courses in Oakland,
California, tells how he became a good customer of a
shop because the proprietor got him to say “yes, yes.”
Eddie had become interested in bow hunting and had
spent considerable money in purchasing equipment and
supplies from a local bow store. When his brother was
visiting him he wanted to rent a bow for him from this
store. The sales clerk told him they didn’t rent bows, so
Eddie phoned another bow store. Eddie described what
happened:
“A very pleasant gentleman answered the phone. His
response to my question for a rental was completely different
from the other place. He said he was sorry but
they no longer rented bows because they couldn’t afford
to do so. He then asked me if I had rented before. I
replied, ‘Yes, several years ago.’ He reminded me that I
probably paid $25 to $30 for the rental. I said ‘yes’ again.
He then asked if I was the kind of person who liked to
save money. Naturally, I answered ‘yes.’ He went on to
explain that they had bow sets with all the necessary
equipment on sale for $34.95. I could buy a complete set
for only $4.95 more than I could rent one. He explained
that is why they had discontinued renting them. Did I
think that was reasonable? My ‘yes’ response led to a
purchase of the set, and when I picked it up I purchased
several more items at this shop and have since become
a regular customer.”
Socrates, “the gadfly of Athens,” was one of the greatest
philosophers the world has ever known. He did
something that only a handful of men in all history have
been able to do: he sharply changed the whole course of
human thought; and now, twenty-four centuries after his
death, he is honored as one of the wisest persuaders who
ever influenced this wrangling world.
His method? Did he tell people they were wrong? Oh,
no, not Socrates. He was far too adroit for that. His whole
technique, now called the “Socratic method,” was based
upon getting a “yes, yes” response. He asked questions
with which his opponent would have to agree. He kept
on winning one admission after another until he had an
armful of yeses. He kept on asking questions until finally,
almost without realizing it, his opponents found
themselves embracing a conclusion they would have bitterly
denied a few minutes previously.
The next time we are tempted to tell someone he or
she is wrong, let’s remember old Socrates and ask a
gentle question - a question that will get the “yes, yes”
response.
The Chinese have a proverb pregnant with the age-old
wisdom of the Orient: “He who treads softly goes
far.”
They have spent five thousand years studying human
nature, those cultured Chinese, and they have garnered
a lot of perspicacity: “He who treads softly goes far.”
PRINCIPLE 5Get the other person saying “yes, yes”immediately.
THE SAFETY VALVE IN HANDLINGCOMPLAINTSMust people trying to win others to their way of thinking
do too much talking themselves. Let the other people
talk themselves out. They know more about their business
and problems than you do. So ask them questions.
Let them tell you a few things.
If you disagree with them you may be tempted to interrupt.
But don’t. It is dangerous. They won’t pay attention
to you while they still have a lot of ideas of their
own crying for expression. So listen patiently and with
an open mind. Be sincere about it. Encourage them to
express their ideas fully.
Does this policy pay in business? Let’s see. Here is
the story of a sales representative who was forced to try
it.
One of the largest automobile manufacturers in the
United States was negotiating for a year’s requirements
of upholstery fabrics. Three important manufacturers
had worked up fabrics in sample bodies. These had all
been inspected by the executives of the motor company,
and notice had been sent to each manufacturer saying
that, on a certain day, a representative from each supplier
would be given an opportunity to make a final plea
for the contract.
G.B.R., a representative of one manufacturer, arrived
in town with a severe attack of laryngitis. “When it came
my turn to meet the executives in conference,” Mr.
R---- said as he related the story before one of my
classes, “I had lost my voice. I could hardly whisper. I
was ushered into a room and found myself face to face
with the textile engineer, the purchasing agent, the director
of sales and the president of the company. I stood
up and made a valiant effort to speak, but I couldn’t do
anything more than squeak.
“They were all seated around a table, so I wrote on a
pad of paper: ‘Gentlemen, I have lost my voice. I am
speechless.’
&quot; ‘I’ll do the talking for you,’ the president said. He
did. He exhibited my samples and praised their good
points. A lively discussion arose about the merits of my
goods. And the president, since he was talking for me,
took the position I would have had during the discussion
My sole participation consisted of smiles, nods and
a few gestures.
“As a result of this unique conference, I was awarded
the contract, which called for over half a million yards of
upholstery fabrics at an aggregate value of $1,600,000 -
the biggest order I had ever received.
&quot;I know I would have lost the contract if I hadn’t lost
my voice, because I had the wrong idea about the whole
proposition. I discovered, quite by accident, how richly
it sometimes pays to let the other person do the talking.&#x27;
Letting the other person do the talking helps in family
situations as well as in business. Barbara Wilson&#x27;s relationship
with her daughter, Laurie, was deteriorating
rapidly. Laurie, who had been a quiet, complacent child,
had grown into an uncooperative, sometimes belligerent
teenager. Mrs. Wilson lectured her, threatened her and
punished her, but all to no avail.
“One day,” Mrs. Wilson told one of our classes, &quot;I just
gave up. Laurie had disobeyed me and had left the
house to visit her girl friend before she had completed
her chores. When she returned I was about to scream at
her for the ten-thousandth time, but I just didn’t have
the strength to do it. I just looked at her and said sadly,
‘Why, Laurie, Why?’
“Laurie noted my condition and in a calm voice asked,
‘Do you really want to know?’ I nodded and Laurie told
me, first hesitantly, and then it all flowed out. I had
never listened to her. I was always telling her to do this
or that. When she wanted to tell me her thoughts, feelings,
ideas, I interrupted with more orders. I began to
realize that she needed me - not as a bossy mother, but
as a confidante, an outlet for all her confusion about
growing up. And all I had been doing was talking when
I should have been listening. I never heard her.
“From that time on I let her do all the talking she
wanted. She tells me what is on her mind, and our relationship
has improved immeasurably. She is again a cooperative
person.”
A large advertisement appeared on the financial page
of a New York newspaper calling for a person with unusual
ability and experience. Charles T. Cubellis answered
the advertisement, sending his reply to a box
number. A few days later, he was invited by letter to call
for an interview. Before he called, he spent hours in
Wall Street finding out everything possible about the
person who had founded the business. During the interview,
he remarked: &quot;I should be mighty proud to be
associated with an organization with a record like yours.
I understand you started twenty-eight years ago with
nothing but desk room and one stenographer. Is that
true?”
Almost every successful person likes to reminisce
about his early struggles. This man was no exception.
He talked for a long time about how he had started with
$450 in cash and an original idea. He told how he had
fought against discouragement and battled against ridicule,
working Sundays and holidays, twelve to sixteen
hours a day; how he had finally won against all odds
until now the most important executives on Wall Street
were coming to him for information and guidance. He
was proud of such a record. He had a right to be, and he
had a splendid time telling about it. Finally, he questioned
Mr. Cubellis briefly about his experience, then
called in one of his vice presidents and said: “I think
this is the person we are looking for.”
Mr. Cubellis had taken the trouble to find out about
the accomplishments of his prospective employer. He
showed an interest in the other person and his problems.
He encouraged the other person to do most of the talking</li></ul><ul><li>and made a favorable impression.
Roy G. Bradley of Sacramento, California, had the opposite
problem. He listened as a good prospect for a
sales position talked himself into a job with Bradley’s
firm, Roy reported:
“Being a small brokerage firm, we had no fringe benefits,
such as hospitalization, medical insurance and pensions.
Every representative is an independent agent. We
don’t even provide leads for prospects, as we cannot advertise
for them as our larger competitors do.
“Richard Pryor had the type of experience we wanted
for this position, and he was interviewed first by my
assistant, who told him about all the negatives related to
this job. He seemed slightly discouraged when he came
into my office. I mentioned the one benefit of being associated
with my firm, that of being an independent contractor
and therefore virtually being self-employed.
“As he talked about these advantages to me, he talked
himself out of each negative thought he had when he
came in for the interview. Several times it seemed as
though he was half talking to himself as he was thinking
through each thought. At times I was tempted to add to
his thoughts; however, as the interview came to a close
I felt he had convinced himself, very much on his own,
that he would like to work for my firm.
“Because I had been a good listener and let Dick do
most of the talking, he was able to weigh both sides
fairly in his mind, and he came to the positive conclusion,
which was a challenge he created for himself. We
hired him and he has been an outstanding representative
for our firm,”
Even our friends would much rather talk to us about
their achievements than listen to us boast about ours.
La Rochefoucauld, the French philosopher, said: “If
you want enemies, excel your friends; but if you want
friends, let your friends excel you.”
Why is that true? Because when our friends excel us,
they feel important; but when we excel them, they - or
at least some of them - will feel inferior and envious.
By far the best-liked placement counselor in the Mid-town
Personnel Agency in New York City was Henrietta
G ---- It hadn’t always been that way. During the first
few months of her association with the agency, Henrietta
didn’t have a single friend among her colleagues. Why?
Because every day she would brag about the placements
she had made, the new accounts she had opened, and
anything else she had accomplished.
&quot;I was good at my work and proud of it,” Henrietta
told one of our classes. &quot; But instead of my colleagues
sharing my triumphs, they seemed to resent them. I
wanted to be liked by these people. I really wanted
them to be my friends. After listening to some of the
suggestions made in this course, I started to talk about
myself less and listen more to my associates. They also
had things to boast about and were more excited about
telling me about their accomplishments than about listening
to my boasting. Now, when we have some time
to chat, I ask them to share their joys with me, and I only
mention my achievements when they ask.”
PRINCIPLE 6Let the other person do a great deal of thetalking.
HOW TO GET COOPERATIONDon’t you have much more faith in ideas that you discover
for yourself than in ideas that are handed to you
on a silver platter? If so, isn’t it bad judgment to try to
ram your opinions down the throats of other people?
Isn’t it wiser to make suggestions - and let the other person
think out the conclusion?
Adolph Seltz of Philadelphia, sales manager in an automobile
showroom and a student in one of my courses,
suddenly found himself confronted with the necessity of
injecting enthusiasm into a discouraged and disorganized
group of automobile salespeople. Calling a sales
meeting, he urged his people to tell him exactly what
they expected from him. As they talked, he wrote their
ideas on the blackboard. He then said: “I’ll give you all
these qualities you expect from me. Now I want you to
tell me what I have a right to expect from you.” The
replies came quick and fast: loyalty, honesty, initiative,
optimism, teamwork, eight hours a day of enthusiastic
work, The meeting ended with a new courage, a new
inspiration - one salesperson volunteered to work fourteen
hours a day - and Mr. Seltz reported to me that the
increase of sales was phenomenal.
“The people had made a sort of moral bargain with
me, &quot; said Mr. Seltz, “and as long as I lived up to my part
in it, they were determined to live up to theirs. Consulting
them about their wishes and desires was just the shot
in the arm they needed.”
No one likes to feel that he or she is being sold some-
thing or told to do a thing. We much prefer to feel that
we are buying of our own accord or acting on our own
ideas. We like to be consulted about our wishes, our
wants, our thoughts.
Take the case of Eugene Wesson. He lost countless
thousands of dollars in commissions before he learned
this truth. Mr. Wesson sold sketches for a studio that
created designs for stylists and textile manufacturers.
Mr. Wesson had called on one of the leading stylists in
New York once a week, every week for three years. “He
never refused to see me,” said Mr. Wesson, “but he
never bought. He always looked over my sketches very
carefully and then said: ‘No, Wesson, I guess we don’t
get together today.&#x27; &quot;
After 150 failures, Wesson realized he must be in a
mental rut, so he resolved to devote one evening a week
to the study of influencing human behavior, to help him
develop new ideas and generate new enthusiasm.
He decided on this new approach. With half a dozen
unfinished artists’ sketches under his arm, he rushed
over to the buyer’s office. &quot;I want you to do me a little
favor, if you will,” he said. “‘Here are some uncompleted
sketches. Won’t you please tell me how we could finish
them up in such a way that you could use them?”
The buyer looked at the sketches for a while without
uttering a word. Finally he said: “Leave these with me
for a few days, Wesson, and then come back and see
me.”
Wesson returned three davs later, got his suggestions,
took the sketches back to the studio and had them finished
according to the buyer’s ideas. The result? All accepted.
After that, this buyer ordered scores of other sketches
from Wesson, all drawn according to the buyer’s ideas.
“I realized why I had failed for years to sell him,” said
Mr. Wesson. &quot; I had urged him to buy what I thought he
ought to have. Then I changed my approach completely.
I urged him to give me his ideas. This made him feel
that he was creating the designs. And he was. I didn’t
have to sell him. He bought.”
Letting the other person feel that the idea is his or
hers not only works in business and politics, it works in
family life as well. Paul M. Davis of Tulsa, Oklahoma,
told his class how he applied this principle:
“My family and I enjoyed one of the most interesting
sightseeing vacation trips we have ever taken. I had long
dreamed of visiting such historic sites as the Civil War
battlefield in Gettysburg, Independence Hall in Philadelphia,
and our nation’s capital. Valley Forge, James-town
and the restored colonial village of Williamsburg
were high on the list of things I wanted to see.
“In March my wife, Nancy, mentioned that she had
ideas for our summer vacation which included a tour of
the western states, visiting points of interest in New
Mexico, Arizona, California and Nevada. She had
wanted to make this trip for several years. But we
couldn’t obviously make both trips.
“Our daughter, Anne, had just completed a course in
U.S. history in junior high school and had become very
interested in the events that had shaped our country’s
growth. I asked her how she would like to visit the
places she had learned about on our next vacation. She
said she would love to.
“Two evenings later as we sat around the dinner table,
Nancy announced that if we all agreed, the summer’s
vacation would be to the eastern states, that it would he
a great trip for Anne and thrilling for all of us. We all
concurred.”
This same psychology was used by an X-ray manufacturer
to sell his equipment to one of the largest hospitals
in Brooklyn This hospital was building an addition and
preparing to equip it with the finest X-ray department in
America. Dr. L----, who was in charge of the X-ray department,
was overwhelmed with sales representatives,
each caroling the praises of his own company’s equipment.
One manufacturer, however, was more skillful. He
knew far more about handling human nature than the
others did. He wrote a letter something like this:
Our factory has recently completed a new line of X-ray
equipment. The first shipment of these machines has just
arrived at our office. They are not perfect. We know that,
and we want to improve them. So we should be deeply
obligated to you if you could find time to look them over
and give us your ideas about how they can be made more
serviceable to your profession. Knowing how occupied you
are, I shall be glad to send my car for you at any hour you
specify.
&quot;I was surprised to get that letter,” Dr. L ---- said as
he related the incident before the class. “I was both
surprised and complimented. I had never had an X-ray
manufacturer seeking my advice before. It made me feel
important. I was busy every night that week, but I canceled
a dinner appointment in order to look over the
equipment. The more I studied it, the more I discovered
for myself how much I liked it.
“Nobody had tried to sell it to me. I felt that the idea
of buying that equipment for the hospital was my own. I
sold myself on its superior qualities and ordered it installed.”
Ralph Waldo Emerson in his essay “Self-Reliance”
stated: “In every work of genius we recognize our own
rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain
alienated majesty.”
Colonel Edward M. House wielded an enormous influence
in national and international affairs while Woodrow
Wilson occupied the White House. Wilson leaned
upon Colonel House for secret counsel and advice more
than he did upon even members of his own cabinet.
What method did the Colonel use in influencing the
President? Fortunately, we know, for House himself revealed
it to Arthur D. Howden Smith, and Smith quoted
House in an article in The Saturday Evening Post.
&quot; ‘After I got to know the President,’ House said, ‘I
learned the best way to convert him to an idea was to
plant it in his mind casually, but so as to interest him in
it - so as to get him thinking about it on his own account.
The first time this worked it was an accident. I had been
visiting him at the White House and urged a policy on
him which he appeared to disapprove. But several days
later, at the dinner table, I was amazed to hear him trot
out my suggestion as his own.’ &quot;
Did House interrupt him and say, “That’s not your
idea. That’s mine” ? Oh, no. Not House. He was too
adroit for that. He didn’t care about credit. He wanted
results. So he let Wilson continue to feel that the idea
was his. House did even more than that. He gave Wilson
public credit for these ideas.
Let’s remember that everyone we come in contact
with is just as human as Woodrow Wilson. So let’s use
Colonel House’s technique.
A man up in the beautiful Canadian province of New
Brunswick used this technique on me and won my patronage.
I was planning at the time to do some fishing
and canoeing in New Brunswick. So I wrote the tourist
bureau for information. Evidently my name and address
were put on a mailing list, for I was immediately overwhelmed
with scores of letters and booklets and printed
testimonials from camps and guides. I was bewildered.
I didn’t know which to choose. Then one camp owner
did a clever thing. He sent me the names and telephone
numbers of several New York people who had stayed at
his camp and he invited me to telephone them and discover
for myself what he had to offer.
I found to my surprise that I knew one of the men on
his list. I telephoned him, found out what his experience
had been, and then wired the camp the date of my arrival.
The others had been trying to sell me on their service,
but one let me sell myself. That organization won.
Twenty-five centuries ago, Lao-tse, a Chinese sage,
said some things that readers of this book might use
today:
&quot; The reason why rivers and seas receive the homage
of a hundred mountain streams is that they keep below
them. Thus they are able to reign over all the mountain
streams. So the sage, wishing to be above men, putteth
himself below them; wishing to be before them, he putteth
himself behind them. Thus, though his place be
above men, they do not feel his weight; though his place
be before them, they do not count it an injury.”
PRINCIPLE 7Let the other person feel that the idea is his orhers.
A FORMULA THAT WILL WORKWONDERS FOR YOU
Remember that other people may be totally wrong. But
they don’t think so. Don’t condemn them. Any fool can
do that. Try to understand them. Only wise, tolerant,
exceptional people even try to do that.
There is a reason why the other man thinks and acts
as he does. Ferret out that reason - and you have the key
to his actions, perhaps to his personality
Try honestly to put yourself in his place.
If you say to yourself, “How would I feel, how would
I react if I were in his shoes?” you will save yourself
time and irritation, for “by becoming interested in the
cause, we are less likely to dislike the effect.” And, in
addition, you will sharply increase your skill in human
relationships.
“Stop a minute,” says Kenneth M. Goode in his book
How to Turn People Into Gold, “stop a minute to contrast
your keen interest in your own affairs with your
mild concern about anything else. Realize then, that
everybody else in the world feels exactly the same way!
Then, along with Lincoln and Roosevelt, you will have
grasped the only solid foundation for interpersonal relationships;
namely, that success in dealing with people
depends on a sympathetic grasp of the other persons’
viewpoint.”
Sam Douglas of Hempstead, New York, used to tell
his wife that she spent too much time working on their
lawn, pulling weeds, fertilizing, cutting the grass twice
a week when the lawn didn’t look any better than it had
when they moved into their home four years earlier. Naturally,
she was distressed by his remarks, and each time
he made such remarks the balance of the evening was
ruined.
After taking our course, Mr. Douglas realized how
foolish he had been all those years. It never occurred to
him that she enjoyed doing that work and she might
really appreciate a compliment on her diligence.
One evening after dinner, his wife said she wanted to
pull some weeds and invited him to keep her company.
He first declined, but then thought better of it and went
out after her and began to help her pull weeds. She was
visibly pleased, and together they spent an hour in hard
work and pleasant conversation.
After that he often helped her with the gardening and
complimented her on how fine the lawn looked, what a
fantastic job she was doing with a yard where the soil
was like concrete. Result: a happier life for both because
he had learned to look at things from her point of view</li><li>even if the subject was only weeds.
In his book Getting Through to People, Dr. Gerald S.
Nirenberg commented: &quot;Cooperativeeness in conversation
is achieved when you show that you consider the
other person’s ideas and feelings as important as your
own. Starting your conversation by giving the other person
the purpose or direction of your conversation, governing
what you say by what you would want to hear if
you were the listener, and accepting his or her viewpoint
will encourage the listener to have an open mind
to your ideas.” *</li></ul><ul><li>Dr Gerald S. Nirenberg, Getting Through to People (Englewood Cliffs,
N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1963), p. 31.
I have always enjoyed walking and riding in a park
near my home. Like the Druids of ancient Gaul, I all but
worship an oak tree, so I was distressed season after
season to see the young trees and shrubs killed off by
needless fires. These fires weren’t caused by careless
smokers. They were almost all caused by youngsters
who went out to the park to go native and cook a frankfurter
or an egg under the trees. Sometimes, these fires
raged so fiercely that the fire department had to be called
out to fight the conflagration.
There was a sign on the edge of the park saying that
anyone who started a fire was liable to fine and imprisonment,
but the sign stood in an unfrequented part of the
park, and few of the culprits ever saw it. A mounted
policeman was supposed to look after the park; but he
didn’t take his duties too seriously, and the fires continued
to spread season after season. On one occasion, I
rushed up to a policeman and told him about a fire
spreading rapidly through the park and wanted him to
notify the fire department, and he nonchalantly replied
that it was none of his business because it wasn’t in his
precinct! I was desperate, so after that when I went riding,
I acted as a self-appointed committee of one to protect
the public domain. In the beginning, I am afraid I
didn’t even attempt to see the other people’s point of
view. When I saw a fire blazing under the trees, I was so
unhappy about it, so eager to do the right thing, that I
did the wrong thing. I would ride up to the boys, warn
them that they could be jailed for starting a fire, order
with a tone of authority that it be put out; and, if they
refused, I would threaten to have them arrested. I was
merely unloading my feelings without thinking of their
point of view.
The result? They obeyed - obeyed sullenly and with
resentment. After I rode on over the hill, they probably
rebuilt the fire and longed to burn up the whole park.
With the passing of the years, I acquired a trifle more
knowledge of human relations, a little more tact, a somewhat
greater tendency to see things from the other person’s
standpoint. Then, instead of giving orders, I would
ride up to a blazing fire and begin something like this:
“Having a good time, boys? What are you going to
cook for supper? . . . I loved to build fires myself when I
was a boy - and I still love to. But you know they are
very dangerous here in the park. I know you boys don’t
mean to do any harm, but other boys aren’t so careful.
They come along and see that you have built a fire; so
they build one and don’t put it out when they go home
and it spreads among the dry leaves and kills the trees.
We won’t have any trees here at all if we aren’t more
careful, You could be put in jail for building this fire. But
I don’t want to be bossy and interfere with your pleasure.
I like to see you enjoy yourselves; but won’t you
please rake all the leaves away from the fire right now</li></ul><ul><li>and you’ll be careful to cover it with dirt, a lot of dirt,
before you leave, won’t you? And the next time you want
to have some fun, won’t you please build your fire over
the hill there in the sandpit? It can’t do any harm there.
. . . Thanks so much, boys. Have a good time.”
What a difference that kind of talk made! It made the
boys want to cooperate. No sullenness, no resentment.
They hadn’t been forced to obey orders. They had saved
their faces. They felt better and I felt better because I
had handled the situation with consideration for their
point of view.
Seeing things through another person’s eyes may ease
tensions when personal problems become overwhelming.
Elizabeth Novak of New South Wales, Australia,
was six weeks late with her car payment. “On a Friday,”
she reported, &quot;I received a nasty phone call from the
man who was handling my account informing me if I did
not come up with $122 by Monday morning I could anticipate
further action from the company. I had no way
of raising the money over the weekend, so when I received
his phone call first thing on Monday morning I
expected the worst. Instead of becoming upset I looked
at the situation from his point of view. I apologized most
sincerely for causing him so much inconvenience and
remarked that I must be his most troublesome customer
as this was not the first time I was behind in my payments.
His tone of voice changed immediately, and he
reassured me that I was far from being one of his really
troublesome customers. He went on to tell me several
examples of how rude his customers sometimes were,
how they lied to him and often tried to avoid talking to
him at all. I said nothing. I listened and let him pour out
his troubles to me. Then, without any suggestion from
me, he said it did not matter if I couldn’t pay all the
money immediately. It would be all right if I paid him
$20 by the end of the month and made up the balance
whenever it was convenient for me to do so.”
Tomorrow, before asking anyone to put out a fire or
buy your product or contribute to your favorite charity,
why not pause and close your eyes and try to think the
whole thing through from another person’s point of
view? Ask yourself: “Why should he or she want to do
it?” True, this will take time, but it will avoid making
enemies and will get better results - and with less friction
and less shoe leather.
&quot;I would rather walk the sidewalk in front of a person’s
office for two hours before an interview,” said
Dean Donham of the Harvard business school, “than
step into that office without a perfectly clear idea of what
I was going to say and what that person - from my
knowledge of his or her interests and motives - was
likely to answer.”
That is so important that I am going to repeat it in
italics for the sake of emphasis.
I would rather walk the sidewalk in front of a person’s

If, as a result of reading this book, you get only one
thing - an increased tendency to think always in terms
of the other person’s point of view, and see things from
that person’s angle as well as your own - if you get only
that one thing from this book, it may easily prove to be
one of the stepping - stones of your career.
PRINCIPLE 8Try honestly to see things from the otherperson’s point of view.WHAT EVERYBODY WANTSWouldn&#x27;t you like to have a magic phrase that would
stop arguments, eliminate ill feeling, create good will,
and make the other person listen attentively?
Yes? All right. Here it is: &quot;I don’t blame you one iota
for feeling as you do. If I were you I would undoubtedly
feel just as you do.”
An answer like that will soften the most cantankerous
old cuss alive. And you can say that and be 100 percent
sincere, because if you were the other person you, of
course, would feel just as he does. Take Al Capone, for
example. Suppose you had inherited the same body and
temperament and mind that Al Capone had. Suppose
you had had his environment and experiences. You
would then be precisely what he was - and where he
was. For it is those things - and only those things - that
made him what he was. The only reason, for example,
that you are not a rattlesnake is that your mother and
father weren’t rattlesnakes.
Youdeserve very little credit for being what you are</li><li>and remember, the people who come to you irritated,
bigoted, unreasoning, deserve very little discredit for
being what they are. Feel sorry for the poor devils. Pity
them. Sympathize with them. Say to yourself: “There,
but for the grace of God, go I.”
Three-fourths of the people you will ever meet are
hungering and thirsting for sympathy. Give it to them,
and they will love you.
I once gave a broadcast about the author of Little
Women, Louisa May Alcott. Naturally, I knew she had
lived and written her immortal books in Concord, Massachusetts.
But, without thinking what I was saying, I
spoke of visiting her old home in Concord. New Hampshire.
If I had said New Hampshire only once, it might
have been forgiven. But, alas and alack! I said it twice, I
was deluged with letters and telegrams, stinging messages
that swirled around my defenseless head like a
swarm of hornets. Many were indignant. A few insulting.
One Colonial Dame, who had been reared in Concord,
Massachusetts, and who was then living in Philadelphia,
vented her scorching wrath upon me. She couldn’t have
been much more bitter if I had accused Miss Alcott of
being a cannibal from New Guinea. As I read the letter,
I said to myself, “Thank God, I am not married to that
woman.” I felt like writing and telling her that although
I had made a mistake in geography, she had made a far
greater mistake in common courtesy. That was to be just
my opening sentence. Then I was going to roll up my
sleeves and tell her what I really thought. But I didn’t.
I controlled myself. I realized that any hotheaded
fool could do that - and that most fools would do just
that.
I wanted to be above fools. So I resolved to try to turn
her hostility into friendliness. It would be a challenge, a
sort of game I could play. I said to myself, &quot;After all, if
I were she, I would probably feel just as she does.”
So, I determined to sympathize with her viewpoint.
The next time I was in Philadelphia, I called her on the
telephone. The conversation went something like
this:
ME:Mrs. So-and-So, you wrote me a letter a few weeks
ago, and I want to thank you for it.
SHE: (in incisive, cultured, well-bred tones): To whom
have I the honor of speaking?
ME:I am a stranger to you. My name is Dale Carnegie.
You listened to a broadcast I gave about Louisa May
Alcott a few Sundays ago, and I made the unforgivable
blunder of saying that she had lived in Concord,
New Hampshire. It was a stupid blunder, and
I want to apologize for it. It was so nice of you to
take the time to write me.
SHE :I am sorry, Mr. Carnegie, that I wrote as I did. I lost
my temper. I must apologize.
ME:No! No! You are not the one to apologize; I am. Any
school child would have known better than to have
said what I said. I apologized over the air the following
Sunday, and I want to apologize to you personally
now.
SHE :I was born in Concord, Massachusetts. My family
has been prominent in Massachusetts affairs for two
centuries, and I am very proud of my native state. I
was really quite distressed to hear you say that Miss
Alcott had lived in New Hampshire. But I am really
ashamed of that letter.
ME:I assure you that you were not one-tenth as distressed
as I am. My error didn’t hurt Massachusetts,
but it did hurt me. It is so seldom that people of
your standing and culture take the time to write
people who speak on the radio, and I do hope you
will write me again if you detect an error in my
talks.
SHE:You know, I really like very much the way you have
accepted my criticism. You must be a very nice person.
I should like to know you better.
So, because I had apologized and sympathized with
her point of view, she began apologizing and sympathizing
with my point of view, I had the satisfaction of
controlling my temper, the satisfaction of returning
kindness for an insult. I got infinitely more real fun out
of making her like me than I could ever have gotten out
of telling her to go and take a jump in the Schuylkill
River,
Every man who occupies the White House is faced
almost daily with thorny problems in human relations.
President Taft was no exception, and he learned from
experience the enormous chemical value of sympathy in
neutralizing the acid of hard feelings. In his book Ethics
in Service, Taft gives rather an amusing illustration of
how he softened the ire of a disappointed and ambitious
mother.
“A lady in Washington,” wrote Taft, “whose husband
had some political influence, came and labored with me
for six weeks or more to appoint her son to a position.
She secured the aid of Senators and Congressmen in
formidable number and came with them to see that they
spoke with emphasis. The place was one requiring technical
qualification, and following the recommendation
of the head of the Bureau, I appointed somebody else. I
then received a letter from the mother, saying that I was
most ungrateful, since I declined to make her a happy
woman as I could have done by a turn of my hand. She
complained further that she had labored with her state
delegation and got all the votes for an administration bill
in which I was especially interested and this was the
way I had rewarded her.
“When you get a letter like that, the first thing you do
is to think how you can be severe with a person who has
committed an impropriety, or even been a little impertinent.
Then you may compose an answer. Then if you
are wise, you will put the letter in a drawer and lock the
drawer. Take it out in the course of two days - such communications
will always bear two days’ delay in answering</li><li>and when you take it out after that interval, you
will not send it. That is just the course I took. After that,
I sat down and wrote her just as polite a letter as I could,
telling her I realized a mother’s disappointment under
such circumstances, but that really the appointment was
not left to my mere personal preference, that I had to
select a man with technical qualifications, and had,
therefore, to follow the recommendations of the head of
the Bureau. I expressed the hope that her son would go
on to accomplish what she had hoped for him in the
position which he then had. That mollified her and she
wrote me a note saying she was sorry she had written as
she had.
“But the appointment I sent in was not confirmed at
once, and after an interval I received a letter which purported
to come from her husband, though it was in the
the same handwriting as all the others. I was therein
advised that, due to the nervous prostration that had followed
her disappointment in this case, she had to take
to her bed and had developed a most serious case of
cancer of the stomach. Would I not restore her to health
by withdrawing the first name and replacing it by her
son’s? I had to write another letter, this one to the husband,
to say that I hoped the diagnosis would prove to
be inaccurate, that I sympathized with him in the sorrow
he must have in the serious illness of his wife, but that it
was impossible to withdraw the name sent in. The man
whom I appointed was confirmed, and within two days
after I received that letter, we gave a musicale at the
White House. The first two people to greet Mrs. Taft and
me were this husband and wife, though the wife had so
recently been in articulo mortis.&quot;
Jay Mangum represented an elevator-escalator main-tenance
company in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which had the
maintenance contract for the escalators in one of Tulsa’s
leading hotels. The hotel manager did not want to shut
down the escalator for more than two hours at a time
because he did not want to inconvenience the hotel’s
guests. The repair that had to be made would take at
least eight hours, and his company did not always have
a specially qualified mechanic available at the convenience
of the hotel.
When Mr. Mangum was able to schedule a top-flight
mechanic for this job, he telephoned the hotel manager
and instead of arguing with him to give him the necessary
time, he said:
“Rick, I know your hotel is quite busy and you would
like to keep the escalator shutdown time to a minimum.
I understand your concern about this, and we want to do
everything possible to accommodate you. However, our
diagnosis of the situation shows that if we do not do a
complete job now, your escalator may suffer more serious
damage and that would cause a much longer shutdown.
I know you would not want to inconvenience
your guests for several days.”
The manager had to agree that an eight-hour shut
down was more desirable than several days&#x27;. By sympathizing
with the manager’s desire to keep his patrons
happy, Mr. Mangum was able to win the hotel manager
to his way of thinking easily and without rancor.
Joyce Norris, a piano teacher in St, Louis, Missouri,
told of how she had handled a problem piano teachers
often have with teenage girls. Babette had exceptionally
long fingernails. This is a serious handicap to anyone
who wants to develop proper piano-playing habits.
Mrs. Norris reported: “I knew her long fingernails
would be a barrier for her in her desire to play well.
During our discussions prior to her starting her lessons
with me, I did not mention anything to her about her
nails. I didn’t want to discourage her from taking lessons,
and I also knew she would not want to lose that
which she took so much pride in and such great care to
make attractive.
“After her first lesson, when I felt the time was right,
I said: ‘Babette, you have attractive hands and beautiful
fingernails. If you want to play the piano as well as you
are capable of and as well as you would like to, you
would be surprised how much quicker and easier it
would be for you, if you would trim your nails shorter.
Just think about it, Okay?’ She made a face which was
definitely negative. I also talked to her mother about this
situation, again mentioning how lovely her nails were.
Another negative reaction. It was obvious that Babette’s
beautifully manicured nails were important to her.
“The following week Babette returned for her second
lesson. Much to my surprise, the fingernails had been
trimmed. I complimented her and praised her for making
such a sacrifice. I also thanked her mother for influencing
Babette to cut her nails. Her reply was ‘Oh, I had
nothing to do with it. Babette decided to do it on her
own, and this is the first time she has ever trimmed her
nails for anyone.’ &quot;
Did Mrs. Norris threaten Babette? Did she say she
would refuse to teach a student with long fingernails?
No, she did not. She let Babette know that her finger-
nails were a thing of beauty and it would be a sacrifice
to cut them. She implied, “I sympathize with you - I
know it won’t be easy, but it will pay off in your better
musical development.”
Sol Hurok was probably America’s number one impresario.
For almost half a century he handled artists - such
world-famous artists as Chaliapin, Isadora Duncan, and
Pavlova. Mr. Hurok told me that one of the first lessons
he had learned in dealing with his temperamental stars
was the’ necessity for sympathy, sympathy and more
sympathy with their idiosyncrasies.
For three years, he was impresario for Feodor Chaliapin -
one of the greatest bassos who ever thrilled the
ritzy boxholders at the Metropolitan, Yet Chaliapin was
a constant problem. He carried on like a spoiled child.
To put it in Mr. Hurok’s own inimitable phrase: “He
was a hell of a fellow in every way.”
For example, Chaliapin would call up Mr. Hurok
about noun of the day he was going to sing and say, “Sol,
I feel terrible. My throat is like raw hamburger. It is
impossible for me to sing tonight.” Did Mr. Hurok argue
with him? Oh, no. He knew that an entrepreneur
couldn’t handle artists that way. So he would rush over
to Chaliapin’s hotel, dripping with sympathy. “What a
pity, &quot;he would mourn. “What a pity! My poor fellow.
Of course, you cannot sing. I will cancel the engagement
at once. It will only cost you a couple of thousand dollars,
but that is nothing in comparison to your reputation.&quot;
Then Chaliapin would sigh and say, “Perhaps you had
better come over later in the day. Come at five and see
how I feel then.”
At five o’clock, Mr. Hurok would again rush to his
hotel, dripping with sympathy. Again he would insist on
canceling the engagement and again Chaliapin would
sigh and say, “Well, maybe you had better come to see
me later. I may be better then.”
At seven-thirty the great basso would consent to sing,
only with the understanding that Mr. Hurok would walk
out on the stage of the Metropolitan and announce that
Chaliapin had a very bad cold and was not in good voice.
Mr. Hurok would lie and say he would do it, for he
knew that was the only way to get the basso out on the
stage.
Dr. Arthur I. Gates said in his splendid book Educational
Psychology: “Sympathy the human species universally
craves. The child eagerly displays his injury; or
even inflicts a cut or bruise in order to reap abundant
sympathy. For the same purpose adults . . . show their
bruises, relate their accidents, illness, especially details
of surgical operations. ‘Self-pity’ for misfortunes real or
imaginary is in some measure, practically a universal
practice.&quot;
So, if you want to win people to your way of thinking,
put in practice . . .
PRINCIPLE 9Be sympathetic with the other person’s ideasand desires.
AN APPEAL THAT EVERYBODY LIKES
I was reared on the edge of the Jesse James country out
in Missouri, and I visited the James farm at Kearney,
Missouri, where the son of Jesse James was then
living.
His wife told me stories of how Jesse robbed trains
and held up banks and then gave money to the neighboring
farmers to pay off their mortgages.
Jesse James probably regarded himself as an idealist
at heart, just as Dutch Schultz, &quot;Two Gun” Crowley, Al
Capone and many other organized crime “godfathers”
did generations later. The fact is that all people you meet
have a high regard for themselves and like to be fine and
unselfish in their own estimation.
J. Pierpont Morgan observed, in one of his analytical
interludes, that a person usually has two reasons for
doing a thing: one that sounds good and a real one.
The person himself will think of the real reason. You
don’t need to emphasize that. But all of us, being idealists
at heart, like to think of motives that sound good.
So, in order to change people, appeal to the nobler
motives.
Is that too idealistic to work in business? Let’s see.
Let’s take the case of Hamilton J. Farrell of the Farrell-Mitchell
Company of Glenolden, Pennsylvania. Mr. Farrell
had a disgruntled tenant who threatened to move.
The tenant’s lease still had four months to run; nevertheless,
he served notice that he was vacating immediately,
regardless of lease.
&quot;These people had lived in my house all winter - the
most expensive part of the year,” Mr. Farrell said as he
told the story to the class, “and I knew it would be difficult
to rent the apartment again before fall. I could see
all that rent income going over the hill and believe me,
I saw red.
“Now, ordinarily, I would have waded into that tenant
and advised him to read his lease again. I would have
pointed out that if he moved, the full balance of his rent
would fall due at once - and that I could, and would,
move to collect.
“However, instead of flying off the handle and making
a scene, I decided to try other tactics. So I started like
this: ‘Mr. Doe,’ I said, ‘I have listened to your story,
and I still don’t believe you intend to move. Years in
the renting business have taught me something about
human nature, and I sized you up in the first place as
being a man of your word. In fact, I’m so sure of it that
I’m willing to take a gamble.
&quot; ‘Now, here’s my proposition. Lav your decision on
the table for a few days and think it over. If you come
back to me between now and the first of the month,
when your rent is due, and tell me you still intend to
move, I give you my word I will accept your decision as
final. I will privilege you to move and admit to myself
I’ve been wrong in my judgment. But I still believe
you’re a man of your word and will live up to your contract.
For after all, we are either men or monkeys - and
the choice usually lies with ourselves!’
“Well, when the new month came around, this gentleman
came to see me and paid his rent in person. He and
his wife had talked it over, he said - and decided to stay.
They had concluded that the only honorable thing to do
was to live up to their lease.”
When the late Lord Northcliffe found a newspaper
using a picture of him which he didn’t want published,
he wrote the editor a letter. But did he say, “Please do
not publish that picture of me any more; Idon’t like it”?
No, he appealed to a nobler motive. He appealed to the
respect and love that all of us have for motherhood. He
wrote, “Please do not publish that picture of me any
more. My mother doesn’t like it.”
When John D. Rockefeller, Jr., wished to stop newspaper
photographers from snapping pictures of his children,
he too appealed to the nobler motives. He didn’t,
say: “I don’t want their pictures published.” No, he appealed
to the desire, deep in all of us, to refrain from
harming children. He said: “You know how it is, boys.
You’ve got children yourselves, some of you. And you
know it’s not good for youngsters to get too much publicity.”
When Cyrus H. K. Curtis, the poor boy from Maine,
was starting on his meteoric career, which was destined
to make him millions as owner of The Saturday Evening
Post and the Ladies’ Home Journal, he couldn’t afford to
pay his contributors the prices that other magazines
paid. He couldn’t afford to hire first-class authors to
write for money alone. So he appealed to their nobler
motives. For example, he persuaded even Louisa May
Alcott, the immortal author of Little Women, to write for
him when she was at the flood tide of her fame; and he
did it by offering to send a check for a hundred dollars,
not to her, but to her favorite charity.
Right here the skeptic may say: “Oh, that stuff is all
right for Northcliffe and Rockefeller or a sentimental
novelist. But, I’d like to see you make it work with the
tough babies I have to collect bills from!”
You may be right. Nothing will work in all cases - and
nothing will work with all people. If you are satisfied
with the results you are now getting, why change? If you
are not satisfied, why not experiment?
At any rate, I think you will enjoy reading this
true story told by James L. Thomas, a former student of
mine:
Six customers of a certain automobile company refused
to pay their bills for servicing. None of the customers
protested the entire bill, but each claimed that some
one charge was wrong. In each case, the customer had
signed for the work done, so the company knew it was
right - and said so. That was the first mistake.
Here are the steps the men in the credit department
took to collect these overdue bills. Do you suppose they
succeeded?</li></ul><ol><li>They called on each customer and told him
bluntly that they had come to collect a bill that was
long past due.</li><li>They made it very plain that the company was
absolutely and unconditionally right; therefore he,
the customer, was absolutely and unconditionally
wrong.</li><li>They intimated that they, the company, knew
more about automobiles than he could ever hope to
know. So what was the argument about?</li><li>Result: They argued.
Did any of these methods reconcile the customer and
settle the account? Youcan answer that one yourself.
At this stage of affairs, the credit manager was about to
open fire with a battery of legal talent, when fortunately
the matter came to the attention of the general manager.
The manager investigated these defaulting clients and
discovered that they all had the reputation of paying
their bills promptly, Something was wrong here - something
was drastically wrong about the method of collection.
So he called in James L. Thomas and told him to
collect these “uncollectible” accounts.
Here, in his words, are the steps Mr. Thrrmas took:</li><li>My visit to each customer was likewise to collect a bill
long past due - a bill that we knew was absolutely right.
But I didn’t say a word about that. I explained I had called
to find out what it was the company had done, or failed to
do.</li><li>I made it clear that, until I had heard the customer’s
story, I had no opinion to offer. I told him the company
made no claims to being infallible.</li><li>I told him I was interested only in his car, and that he
knew more about his car than anyone else in the world; that
he was the authority on the subject.</li><li>I let him talk, and I listened to him with all the interest
and sympathy that he wanted - and had expected.</li><li>Finally, when the customer was in a reasonable mood,
I put the whole thing up to his sense of fair play. I appealed
to the nobler motives. “First,” I said, &quot;I want you to know
I also feel this matter has been badly mishandled. You’ve
been inconvenienced and annoyed and irritated by one of
our representatives. That should never have happened. I’m
sorry and, as a representative of the company, I apologize.
As I sat here and listened to your side of the story, I could
not help being impressed by your fairness and patience.
And now, because you are fair - minded and patient, I am
going to ask you to do something for me. It’s something that
you can do better than anyone else, something you know
more about than anyone else. Here is your bill; I know it is
safe for me to ask you to adjust it, just as you would do if
you were the president of my company. I am going to leave
it all up to you. Whatever you say goes.”
Did he adjust the bill? He certainly did, and got quite a
kick out of it, The bills ranged from $150 to $400 - but did
the customer give himself the best of it? Yes, one of them
did! One of them refused to pay a penny of the disputed
charge; but the other five all gave the company the best of
it! And here’s the cream of the whole thing: we delivered
new cars to all six of these customers within the next two
years!
“Experience has taught me,” says Mr. Thomas, &quot;that
when no information can be secured about the customer,
the only sound basis on which to proceed is to assume
that he or she is sincere, honest, truthful and willing and
anxious to pay the charges, once convinced they are correct.
To put it differently and perhaps mare clearly, people
are honest and want to discharge their obligations.
The exceptions to that rule are comparatively few, and I
am convinced that the individuals who are inclined to
chisel will in most cases react favorably if you make
them feel that you consider them honest, upright and fair.&quot;
PRINCIPLE 10Appeal to the nobler motives.THE MOVIES DO IT. TV DOES IT.WHY DON’T YOU DO IT?Many years ago, the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin was
being maligned by a dangerous whispering campaign. A
malicious rumor was being circulated. Advertisers were
being told that the newspaper was no longer attractive
to readers because it carried too much advertising and
too little news. Immediate action was necessary. The
gossip had to be squelched.
But how?
This is the way it was done.
The Bulletin clipped from its regular edition all reading
matter of all kinds on one average day, classified it,
and published it as a book. The book was called One
Day. It contained 307 pages - as many as a hard-covered
book; yet the Bulletin had printed all this news and feature
material on one day and sold it, not for several dollars,
but for a few cents.
The printing of that book dramatized the fact that the
Bulletin carried an enormous amount of interesting
reading matter. It conveyed the facts more vividly, more
interestingly, more impressively, than pages of figures
and mere talk could have done.
This is the day of dramatization. Merely stating a truth
isn’t enough. The truth has to be made vivid, interesting,
dramatic. You have to use showmanship. The movies do
it. Television does it. And you will have to do it if you
want attention.
Experts in window display know the power of dramazation.
For example, the manufacturers of a new rat
poison gave dealers a window display that included two
live rats. The week the rats were shown, sales zoomed
to five times their normal rate.
Television commercials abound with examples of the
use of dramatic techniques in selling products. Sit down
one evening in front of your television set and analyze
what the advertisers do in each of their presentations.
You will note how an antacid medicine changes the
color of the acid in a test tube while its competitor
doesn’t, how one brand of soap or detergent gets a greasy
shirt clean when the other brand leaves it gray. You’ll
see a car maneuver around a series of turns and curves</li></ol><ul><li>far better than just being told about it. Happy faces
will show contentment with a variety of products. All of
these dramatize for the viewer the advantages offered by
whatever is being sold - and they do get people to buy
them.
You can dramatize your ideas in business or in any
other aspect of your life. It’s easy. Jim Yeamans, who
sells for the NCR company (National Cash Register) in
Richmond, Virginia, told how he made a sale by dramatic
demonstration.
“Last week I called on a neighborhood grocer and saw
that the cash registers he was using at his checkout
counters were very old-fashioned. I approached the
owner and told him: ‘You are literally throwing away
pennies every time a customer goes through your line.’
With that I threw a handful of pennies on the floor.
He quickly became more attentive. The mere words
should have been of interest to him, but the sound of
Pennies hitting the floor really stopped him. I was able
to get an order from him to replace all of his old
machines.”
It works in home life as well. When the old-time lover
Proposed to his sweetheart, did he just use words of
love? No! He went down on his knees. That really
showed he meant what he said. We don’t propose on our
knees any more, but many suitors still set up a romantic
atmosphere before they pop the question.
Dramatizing what you want works with children as
well. Joe B. Fant, Jr., of Birmingham, Alabama, was having
difficulty getting his five-year-old boy and three-year-
old daughter to pick up their toys, so he invented a
“train.” Joey was the engineer (Captain Casey Jones) on
his tricycle. Janet’s wagon was attached, and in the evening
she loaded all the “coal” on the caboose (her
wagon) and then jumped in while her brother drove her
around the room. In this way the room was cleaned up</li><li>without lectures, arguments or threats.
Mary Catherine Wolf of Mishawaka, Indiana, was having
some problems at work and decided that she had to
discuss them with the boss. On Monday morning she
requested an appointment with him but was told he was
very busy and she should arrange with his secretary for
an appointment later in the week. The secretary indicated
that his schedule was very tight, but she would try
to fit her in.
Ms. Wolf described what happened:
&quot;I did not get a reply from her all week long. Whenever
I questioned her, she would give me a reason why
the boss could not see me. Friday morning came and I
had heard nothing definite. I really wanted to see him
and discuss my problems before the weekend, so I asked
myself how I could get him to see me.
“What I finally did was this. I wrote him a formal letter.
I indicated in the letter that I fully understood how
extremely busy he was all week, but it was important
that I speak with him. I enclosed a form letter and a self-
addressed envelope and asked him to please fill it out or
ask his secretary to do it and return it to me. The form
letter read as follows:
Ms. Wolf - I will be able to see you on <strong><strong>__</strong></strong> a t
<strong><strong>__</strong></strong>A.M/P.M. I will give you <strong>_</strong>minutes of
my time.
&quot;I put this letter in his in-basket at 11 A.M. At 2 P.M. I
checked my mailbox. There was my self-addressed envelope.
He had answered my form letter himself and
indicated he could see me that afternoon and could give
me ten minutes of his time. I met with him, and we
talked for over an hour and resolved my problems.
“If I had not dramatized to him the fact that I really
wanted to see him, I would probably be still waiting for
an appointment.”
James B. Boynton had to present a lengthy market report.
His firm had just finished an exhaustive study for a
leading brand of cold cream. Data were needed immediately
about the competition in this market; the prospective
customer was one of the biggest - and most
formidable - men in the advertising business.
And his first approach failed almost before he began.
“The first time I went in,” Mr. Boynton explains, &quot;I
found myself sidetracked into a futile discussion of the
methods used in the investigation. He argued and I argued.
He told me I was wrong, and I tried to prove that
I was right.
&quot;I finally won my point, to my own satisfaction - but
my time was up, the interview was over, and I still
hadn’t produced results.
&quot;The second time, I didn’t bother with tabulations of
figures and data, I went to see this man, I dramatized my
facts I.
“As I entered his office, he was busy on the phone.
While he finished his conversation, I opened a suitcase
and dumped thirty-two jars of cold cream on top of his
desk - all products he knew - all competitors of his
cream.
“On each jar, I had a tag itemizing the results of the
trade investigation, And each tag told its story briefly,
dramatically.
“What happened?
“There was no longer an argument. Here was something
new, something different. He picked up first one
and then another of the jars of cold cream and read the
information on the tag. A friendly conversation developed.
He asked additional questions. He was intensely
interested. He had originally given me only ten minutes
to present my facts, but ten minutes passed, twenty minutes,
forty minutes, and at the end of an hour we were
still talking.
“I was presenting the same facts this time that I had
presented previously. But this time I was using dramatization,
showmanship - and what a difference it made.”
PRINCIPLE 11Dramatize your ideas.WHEN NOTHING ELSE WORKS,TRY THISCharles Schwab had a mill manager whose people
weren’t producing their quota of work.
“How is it,” Schwab asked him, “that a manager as
capable as you can’t make this mill turn out what it
should?”
&quot;I don’t know,” the manager replied. “I’ve coaxed the
men, I’ve pushed them, I’ve sworn and cussed, I’ve
threatened them with damnation and being fired. But
nothing works. They just won’t produce.”
This conversation took place at the end of the day, just
before the night shift came on. Schwab asked the manager
for a piece of chalk, then, turning to the nearest
man, asked: “How many heats did your shift make
today?”
&quot;Six.&quot;
Without another word, Schwab chalked a big figure
six on the floor, and walked away.
When the night shift came in, they saw the “6” and
asked what it meant.
“The big boss was in here today,” the day people said.
“He asked us how many heats we made, and we told
him six. He chalked it down on the floor.”
The next morning Schwab walked through the mill
again. The night shift had rubbed out “6” and replaced
it with a big “7.”
When the day shift reported for work the next morning,
they saw a big “7” chalked on the floor. So the night
shift thought they were better than the day shift did
they? Well, they would show the night shift a thing or
two. The crew pitched in with enthusiasm, and when
they quit that night, they left behind them an enormous,
swaggering &quot;10.&quot; Things were stepping up.
Shortly this mill, which had been lagging way behind
in production, was turning out more work than any other
mill in the plant.
The principle?
Let Charles Schwab say it in his own words: “The
way to get things done,” say Schwab, “is to stimulate
competition. I do not mean in a sordid, money-getting
way, but in the desire to excel.”
The desire to excel! The challenge! Throwing down
the gauntlet! An infallible way of appealing to people of
spirit.
Without a challenge, Theodore Roosevelt would never
have been President of the United States. The Rough
Rider, just back from Cuba, was picked for governor of
New York State. The opposition discovered he was no
longer a legal resident of the state, and Roosevelt,
frightened, wished to withdraw. Then Thomas Collier
Platt, then U.S. Senator from New York, threw down the
challenge. Turning suddenly on Theodore Roosevelt, he
cried in a ringing voice: “Is the hero of San Juan Hill a
coward?”
Roosevelt stayed in the fight - and the rest is history.
A challenge not only changed his life; it had a real effect
upon the future of his nation.
“All men have fears, but the brave put down their
fears and go forward, sometimes to death, but always to
victory” was the motto of the King’s Guard in ancient
Greece. What greater challenge can be offered than the
opportunity to overcome those fears?
When Al Smith was governor of New York, he was up
against it. Sing Sing, at the time the most notorious pen-
itentiary west of Devil&#x27;s Island, was without a warden.
Scandals had been sweeping through the pristin walls,
scandals and ugly rumors. Smith needed a strong man to
rule Sing Sing - an iron man. But who? He sent for
Lewis E. Lawes of New Hampton.
“How about going up to take charge of Sing Sing?” he
said jovially when Lawes stood before him. “They need
a man up there with experience.”
Lawes was flabbergasted. He knew the dangers of
Sing Sing. It was a political appointment, subject to the
vagaries of political whims. Wardens had come and gone</li><li>one had lasted only three weeks. He had a career to
consider. Was it worth the risk?
Then Smith, who saw his hesitation, leaned back in
his chair and smiled. “Young fellow,” he said, “I don’t
blame you for being scared. It’s a tough spot. It’ll take a
big person to go up there and stay.”
So Smith was throwing down a challenge, was he?
Lawes liked the idea of attempting a job that called for
someone “big.”
So he went. And he stayed. He stayed, to become the
most famous warden of his time. His book 20,000 Years
in Sing Singsold into the hundred of thousands of copies.
His broadcasts on the air and his stories of prison
life have inspired dozens of movies. His “humanizing”
of criminals wrought miracles in the way of prison reform.
“I have never found,” said Harvey S. Firestone,
founder of the great Firestone Tire and Rubber Company,
“that pay and pay alone would either bring together
or hold good people. I think it was the game
itself.”
Frederic Herzberg, one of the great behavorial scientists,
concurred. He studied in depth the work attitudes
of thousands of people ranging from factory workers to
senior executives. What do you think he found to be the
most motivating factor - the one facet of the jobs that
was most stimulating? Money? Good working conditions?
Fringe benefits? No - not any of those. The one
major factor that motivated people was the work itself. If
the work was exciting and interesting, the worker looked
forward to doing it and was motivated to do a good job.
That is what every successful person loves: the game.
The chance for self-expression. The chance to prove his
or her worth, to excel, to win. That is what makes foot-races
and hog-calling and pie-eating contests. The desire
to excel. The desire for a feeling of importance.

PART FOUR
Be a Leader: How to ChangePeople Without GivingOffense or ArousingResentmentIF YOU MUST FIND FAULT, THIS ISTHE WAY TO BEGINA friend of mine was a guest at the White House for a
weekend during the administration of Calvin Coolidge.
Drifting into the President’s private office, he heard
Coolidge say to one of his secretaries, “That’s a pretty
dress you are wearing this morning, and you are a very
attractive young woman.”
That was probably the most effusive praise Silent Cal
had ever bestowed upon a secretary in his life. It was so
unusual, so unexpected, that the secretary blushed in
confusion. Then Coolidge said, “Now, don’t get stuck
up. I just said that to make you feel good. From now on,
I wish you would be a little bit more careful with your
Punctuation.”
His method was probably a bit obvious, but the psychology
was superb. It is always easier to listen to unpleasant
things after we have heard some praise of our
good points.
A barber lathers a man before he shaves him; and that
is precisely what McKinley did back in 1896, when he
was running for President. One of the prominent Republicans
of that day had written a campaign speech that he
felt was just a trifle better than Cicero and Patrick Henry
and Daniel Webster all rolled into one. With great glee,
this chap read his immortal speech aloud to McKinley.
The speech had its fine points, but it just wouldn’t do. It
would have raised a tornado of criticism. McKinley
didn’t want to hurt the man’s feelings. He must not kill
the man’s splendid enthusiasm, and yet he had to say
&quot;no.&quot; Note how adroitly he did it.
&quot;My friend, that is a splendid speech, a magnificent
speech,” McKinley said. “No one could have prepared a
better one. There are many occasions on which it would
be precisely the right thing to say, but is it quite suitable
to this particular occasion? Sound and sober as it is from
your standpoint, I must consider its effect from the
party’s standpoint. Now you go home and write a speech
along the lines I indicate, and send me a copy of it.”
He did just that. McKinley blue-penciled and helped
him rewrite his second speech, and he became one of
the effective speakers of the campaign.
Here is the second most famous letter that Abraham
Lincoln ever wrote. (His most famous one was written to
Mrs. Bixby, expressing his sorrow for the death of the
five sons she had lost in battle.) Lincoln probably dashed
this letter off in five minutes; yet it sold at public auction
in 1926 for twelve thousand dollars, and that, by the
way, was more money than Lincoln was able to save
during half a century of hard work. The letter was written
to General Joseph Hooker on April 26, 1863, during
the darkest period of the Civil War. For eighteen
months, Lincoln’s generals had been leading the Union
Army from one tragic defeat to another. Nothing but futile,
stupid human butchery. The nation was appalled.
Thousands of soldiers had deserted from the army, and
en the Republican members of the Senate had revolted
and wanted to force Lincoln out of the White House.
“We are now on the brink of destruction,” Lincoln
said. It appears to me that even the Almighty is
against us. I can hardly see a ray of hope.” Such was the
black sorrow and chaos out of which this letter
came.
I am printing the letter here because it shows how
Lincoln tried to change an obstreperous general when
the very fate of the nation could have depended upon
the general’s action.
This is perhaps the sharpest letter Abe Lincoln wrote
after he became President; yet you will note that he
praised General Hooker before he spoke of his grave
faults.
Yes, they were grave faults, but Lincoln didn’t call
them that. Lincoln was more conservative, more diplomatic.
Lincoln wrote: “There are some things in regard
to which I am not quite satisfied with you.” Talk about
tact! And diplomacy!
Here is the letter addressed to General Hooker:
I have placed you at the head of the Army of the Potomac.
Of course, I have done this upon what appears to me to be
sufficient reasons, and yet I think it best for you to know
that there are some things in regard to which I am not quite
satisfied with you.
I believe you to be a brave and skillful soldier, which, of
course, I like. I also believe you do not mix politics with
your profession, in which you are right. You have confidence
in yourself, which is a valuable if not an indispensable
quality.
You are ambitious, which, within reasonable bounds,
does good rather than harm, But I think that during General
Burnside’s command of the army you have taken counsel of
your ambition and thwarted him as much as you could, in
which you did a great wrong to the country and to a most
meritorious and honorable brother officer.
I have heard, in such a way as to believe it, of your recently
saying that both the army and the Government
needed a dictator. Of course, it was not for this, but in spite
of it, that I have given you command.
Only those generals who gain successes can set up as
dictators. What I now ask of you is military success and I
will risk the dictatorship.
The Government will support you to the utmost of its
ability, which is neither more nor less than it has done and
will do for all commanders. I much fear that the spirit which
you have aided to infuse into the army, of criticizing their
commander and withholding confidence from him, will
now turn upon you. I shall assist you, as far as I can, to put
it down.
Neither you nor Napoleon, if he were alive again, could
get any good out of an army while such spirit prevails in it,
and now beware of rashness. Beware of rashness, but with
energy and sleepless vigilance go forward and give us victories.
You are not a Coolidge, a McKinley or a Lincoln. You
want to know whether this philosophy will operate for
you in everyday business contacts. Will it? Let’s see.
Let’s take the case of W. P. Gaw of the Wark Company,
Philadelphia.
The Wark Company had contracted to build and complete
a large office building in Philadelphia by a certain
specified date. Everything was going along well; the
building was almost finished, when suddenly the sub-contractor
making the ornamental bronze work to go on
the exterior of this building declared that he couldn’t
make delivery on schedule. What! An entire building
held up! Heavy penalties! Distressing losses! All because
of one man!
Long-distance telephone calls. Arguments! Heated
conversations! All in vain. Then Mr. Gaw was sent to
New York to beard the bronze lion in his den.
“Do you know you are the only person in Brooklyn
with your name,?&quot; Mr Gaw asked the president of the
subcontracting firm shortly after they were introduced.
The president was surprised. “No, I didn’t know
that.”
“Well,” said Mr. Gaw, “when I got off the train this
morning, I looked in the telephone book to get your
address, and you’re the only person in the Brooklyn
phone book with your name.”
“I never knew that,” the subcontractor said. He
checked the phone book with interest. “Well, it’s an unusual
name,” he said proudly. &quot;My family came from
Holland and settled in New York almost two hundred
years ago. &quot; He continued to talk about his family and his
ancestors for several minutes. When he finished that,
Mr. Gaw complimented him on how large a plant he had
and compared it favorably with a number of similar
plants he had visited. “It is one of the cleanest and neatest
bronze factories I ever saw,” said Gaw.
“I’ve spent a lifetime building up this business,” the
subcontractor said, “and I am rather proud of it. Would
you like to take a look around the factory?”
During this tour of inspection, Mr. Gaw complimented
the other man on his system of fabrication and
told him how and why it seemed superior to those of
some of his competitors. Gaw commented on some unusual
machines, and the subcontractor announced that
he himself had invented those machines. He spent considerable
time showing Gaw how they operated and the
superior work they turned out. He insisted on taking his
visitor to lunch. So far, mind you, not a word had been
said about the real purpose of Gaw’s visit.
After lunch, the subcontractor said, “Now, to get down
to business. Naturally, I know why you’re here. I didn’t
expect that our meeting would be so enjoyable. You can
go back to Philadelphia with my promise that your material
will be fabricated and shipped, even if other orders
have to be delayed.”
Mr. Gaw got everything that he wanted without even
asking for it. The material arrived on time, and the building
was completed on the day the completion contract
specified.
Would this have happened had Mr. Gaw used the
hammer-and-dynamite method generally employed on
such occasions?
Dorothy Wrublewski, a branch manager of the Fort
Monmouth, New Jersey, Federal Credit Union, reported
to one of our classes how she was able to help one of her
employees become more productive.
“We recently hired a young lady as a teller trainee.
Her contact with our customers was very good. She was
accurate and efficient in handling individual transactions.
The problem developed at the end of the day
when it was time to balance out.
“The head teller came to me and strongly suggested
that I fire this woman. ‘She is holding up everyone else
because she is so slow in balancing out. I’ve shown her
over and over, but she can’t get it. She’s got to go.’
“The next day I observed her working quickly and
accurately when handling the normal everyday transactions,
and she was very pleasant with our customers.
“It didn’t take long to discover why she had trouble
balancing out. After the office closed, I went over to talk
with her. She was obviously nervous and upset. I
praised her for being so friendly and outgoing with the
customers and complimented her for the accuracy and
speed used in that work. I then suggested we review the
procedure we use in balancing the cash drawer. Once
she realized I had confidence in her, she easily followed
my suggestions and soon mastered this function. We
have had no problems with her since then.”
Beginning with praise is like the dentist who begins
his work with Novocain. The patient still gets a drilling,
but the Novocain is pain-killing. A leader will use . . .
PRINCIPLE 1Begin with praise and honest appreciation.
HOW TO CRITICIZE-AND NOT BEHATED FOR ITCharles Schwab was passing through one of his steel
mills one day at noon when he came across some of his
employees smoking. Immediately above their heads was
a sign that said “No Smoking.” Did Schwab point to the
sign and say, “Can’t you read.? Oh, no not Schwab. He
walked over to the men, handed each one a cigar, and
said, “I’ll appreciate it, boys, if you will smoke these on
the outside.” They knew that he knew that they had
broken a rule - and they admired him because he said
nothing about it and gave them a little present and made
them feel important. Couldn’t keep from loving a man
like that, could you?
John Wanamaker used the same technique. Wanamaker
used to make a tour of his great store in Philadelphia
every day. Once he saw a customer waiting at a
counter. No one was paying the slightest attention to
her. The salespeople? Oh, they were in a huddle at the
far end of the counter laughing and talking among themselves.
Wanamaker didn’t say a word. Quietly slipping
behind the counter, he waited on the woman himself
and then handed the purchase to the salespeople to be
wrapped as he went on his way.
Public officials are often criticized for not being accessible
to their constituents. They are busy people, and
the fault sometimes lies in overprotective assistants who
don’t want to overburden their bosses with too many
visitors. Carl Langford, who has been mayor of Orlando,
Florida, the home of Disney World, for many years, frequently
admonished his staff to allow people to see him.
clamed he had an “open-door” policy; yet the citizens
of his community were blocked by secretaries and
administrators when they called.
Finally the mayor found the solution. He removed the
door from his office! His aides got the message, and the
mayor has had a truly open administration since the day
his door was symbolically thrown away.
Simply changing one three-letter word can often spell
the difference between failure and success in changing
people without giving offense or arousing resentment.
Many people begin their criticism with sincere praise
followed by the word “but” and ending with a critical
statement. For example, in trying to change a child’s
careless attitude toward studies, we might say, “We’re
really proud of you, Johnnie, for raising your grades this
term. Butif you had worked harder on your algebra, the
results would have been better.”
In this case, Johnnie might feel encouraged until he
heard the word “but.” He might then question the sincerity
of the original praise. To him, the praise seemed
only to be a contrived lead-in to a critical inference of
failure. Credibility would be strained, and we probably
would not achieve our objectives of changing Johnnie’s
attitude toward his studies.
This could be easily overcome by changing the word
&quot;but&quot; to &quot;and.&quot; “We’re really proud of you, Johnnie, for
raiseing your grades this term, andby continuing the
same conscientious efforts next term, your algebra grade
can be up with all the others.”
Now, Johnnie would accept the praise because there
was no follow-up of an inference of failure. We have
called his attention to the behavior we wished to change
indirectly and the chances are he will try to live up to
our expectations.
Calling attention to one’s mistakes indirectly works
wonders with sensitive people who may resent bitterly
any direct criticism. Marge Jacob of Woonsocket, Rhode
Island, told one of our classes how she convinced some
sloppy construction workers to clean up after themselves
when they were building additions to her house.
For the first few days of the work, when Mrs. Jacob
returned from her job, she noticed that the yard was
strewn with the cut ends of lumber. She didn’t want to
antagonize the builders, because they did excellent
work. So after the workers had gone home, she and her
children picked up and neatly piled all the lumber debris
in a corner. The following morning she called the
foreman to one side and said, “I’m really pleased with
the way the front lawn was left last night; it is nice and
clean and does not offend the neighbors.” From that day
forward the workers picked up and piled the debris to
one side, and the foreman came in each day seeking
approval of the condition the lawn was left in after a
day’s work.
One of the major areas of controversy between members
of the army reserves and their regular army trainers
is haircuts. The reservists consider themselves civilians
(which they are most of the time) and resent having to
cut their hair short.
Master Sergeant Harley Kaiser of the 542nd USAR
School addressed himself to this problem when he was
working with a group of reserve noncommissioned officers.
As an old-time regular-army master sergeant, he
might have been expected to yell at his troops and
threaten them. Instead he chose to make his point indirectly.
“Gentlemen,” he started, “you are leaders. You will
be most effective when you lead by example. You must
be the example for your men to follow. You know what
the army regulations say about haircuts. I am going to
get my hair cut today, although it is still much shorter
than some of yours. You look at yourself in the mirror,
and if you feel you need a haircut to be a good example,
we&#x27;ll arrange time for you to visit the post barbership.”
The result was predictable. Several of the candidates
did look in the mirror and went to the barbershop that
afternoon and received “regulation” haircuts. Sergeant
Kaiser commented the next morning that he already
could see the development of leadership qualities in
some of the members of the squad.
On March 8, 1887, the eloquent Henry Ward Beecher
died. The following Sunday, Lyman Abbott was invited
to speak in the pulpit left silent by Beecher’s passing.
Eager to do his best, he wrote, rewrote and polished his
sermon with the meticulous care of a Flaubert. Then he
read it to his wife. It was poor - as most written speeches
are. She might have said, if she had had less judgment,
“Lyman, that is terrible. That’ll never do. You’ll put people
to sleep. It reads like an encyclopedia. You ought to
know better than that after all the years you have been
preaching. For heaven’s sake, why don’t you talk like a
human being? Why don’t you act natural? You’ll disgrace
yourself if you ever read that stuff.”
That’s what shemight have said. And, if she had, you
know what would have happened. And she knew too.
So, she merely remarked that it would make an excellent
article for the North American Review. In other words,
she praised it and at the same time subtly suggested that
it wouldn’t do as a speech. Lyman Abbott saw the point,
tore up his carefully prepared manuscript and preached
without even using notes.
An effective way to correct others’ mistakes is . . .
PRINCIPLE 2Call attention to people’s mistakes indirectly.
TALK ABOUT YOUR OWNMISTAKES FIRSTMy niece, Josephine Carnegie, had come to New York
to be my secretary. She was nineteen, had graduated
from high school three years previously, and her business
experience was a trifle more than zero. She became
one of the most proficient secretaries west of Suez, but
in the beginning, she was - well, susceptible to improvement.
One day when I started to criticize her, I
said to myself: “Just a minute, Dale Carnegie; just a
minute. You are twice as old as Josephine. You have had
ten thousand times as much business experience. How
can you possibly expect her to have your viewpoint, your
judgment, your initiative - mediocre though they may
be? And just a minute, Dale, what were you doing at
nineteen? Remember the asinine mistakes and blunders
you made? Remember the time you did this . . . and
that . . . ?&quot;
After thinking the matter over, honestly and impartially,
I concluded that Josephine’s batting average at
nineteen was better than mine had been - and that, I’m
sorry to confess, isn’t paying Josephine much of a compliment.
So after that, when I wanted to call Josephine’s attention
to a mistake, I used to begin by saying, “You have
made a mistake, Josephine, but the Lord knows, it’s no
worse than many I have made. You were not born with
judgment. That comes only with experience, and you are
better than I was at your age. I have been guilty of so
many stupid, silly things myself, I have very little incliion
to criticize you or anyone. But don’t you think it
would have been wiser if you had done so and so?&quot;
It isn’t nearly so difficult to listen to a recital of your
faults if the person criticizing begins by humbly admitting
that he, too, is far from impeccable.
E. G. Dillistone, an engineer in Brandon, Manitoba,
Canada, was having problems with his new secretary.
Letters he dictated were coming to his desk for signature
with two or three spelling mistakes per page. Mr. Dillistone
reported how he handled this:
“Like many engineers, I have not been noted for my
excellent English or spelling. For years I have kept a
little black thumb - index book for words I had trouble
spelling. When it became apparent that merely pointing
out the errors was not going to cause my secretary to do
more proofreading and dictionary work, I resolved to
take another approach. When the next letter came to my
attention that had errors in it, I sat down with the typist
and said:
&quot; ‘Somehow this word doesn’t look right. It’s one of
the words I always have had trouble with. That’s the reason
I started this spelling book of mine. <!-- -->[I opened
the book to the appropriate page.]<!-- --> Yes, here it is. I’m
very conscious of my spelling now because people do
judge us by our letters and misspellings make us look
less professional.
&quot;I don&#x27;t know whether she copied my system or not,
but since that conversation, her frequency of spelling
errors has been significantly reduced.”
The polished Prince Bernhard von Bülow learned the
sharp necessity of doing this back in 1909. Von Bülow
was then the Imperial Chancellor of Germany, and on
the throne satWilhelm II-Wilhelm, the haughty; Wilhelm
the arrogant; Wilhelm, the last of the German Kaisers,
building an army and navy that he boasted could
whip their weight in wildcats
Then an astonishing thing happened. The Kaiser said
things, incredible things, things that rocked the continent
and started a series of explosions heard around the
world. To make matters infinitely worse, the Kaiser
made silly, egotistical, absurd announcements in public,
he made them while he was a guest in England, and he
gave his royal permission to have them printed in the
Daily Telegraph. For example, he declared that he was
the only German who felt friendly toward the English;
that he was constructing a navy against the menace of
Japan; that he, and he alone, had saved England from
being humbled in the dust by Russia and France; that it
had been his campaign plan that enabled England’s
Lord Roberts to defeat the Boers in South Africa; and so
on and on.
No other such amazing words had ever fallen from the
lips of a European king in peacetime within a hundred
years. The entire continent buzzed with the fury of a
hornet’s nest. England was incensed. German statesmen
were aghast. And in the midst of all this consternation,
the Kaiser became panicky and suggested to Prince von
Bülow, the Imperial Chancellor, that he take the blame.
Yes, he wanted von Bülow to announce that it was all
his responsibility, that he had advised his monarch to
say these incredible things.
“But Your Majesty,” von Bülow protested, “it seems
to me utterly impossible that anybody either in Germany
or England could suppose me capable of having advised
Your Majesty to say any such thing.”
The moment those words were out of von Bülow&#x27;s
mouth, he realized he had made a grave mistake. The
Kaiser blew up.
“You consider me a donkey,” he shouted, “capable of
blunders you yourself could never have committed!”
Von Bülow&#x27;s knew that he ought to have praised before
he condemned; but since that was too late, he did the
next best thing. He praised after he had criticized. And
it worked a miracle.
&quot;I&#x27;m far from suggesting that,” he answered respectfully.
“Your Majesty surpasses me in manv respects; not
only of course, in naval and military knowledge but
above all, in natural science. I have often listened in
admiration when Your Majesty explained the barometer,
or wireless telegraphy, or the Roentgen rays. I am
shamefully ignorant of all branches of natural science,
have no notion of chemistry or physics, and am quite
incapable of explaining the simplest of natural phenomena.
But,” von Büllow continued, “in compensation, I
possess some historical knowledge and perhaps certain
qualities useful in politics, especially in diplomacy.”
The Kaiser beamed. Von Bulow had praised him. Von
Bülow had exalted him and humbled himself. The Kaiser
could forgive anything after that. “Haven’t I always
told you,&quot; he exclaimed with enthusiasm, “that we complete
one another famously? We should stick together,
and we will!&quot;
He shook hands with von Bülow, not once, but several
times. And later in the day he waxed so enthusiastic that
he exclaimed with doubled fists, “If anyone says anything
to me against Prince von Bülow, Ishall punch him
in the nose.”
Von Bülow saved himself in time - but, canny diplomat
that he was, he nevertheless had made one error: he
should have begun by talking about his own shortcomings
and Wilhelm’s superiority - not by intimating that
the Kaiser wasa half-wit in need of a guardian.
If a few sentences humbling oneself and praising the
other party can turn a haughty, insulted Kaiser into a
staunch friend, imagine what humility and praise can do
for you and me in our daily contacts. Rightfully used,
they will work veritable miracles in human relations.
Admitting one’s own mistakes - even when one hasn’t
corrected them - can help convince somebody to change
his behavior. This was illustrated more recently by Clarence
Zerhusen of Timonium, Maryland, when he discovered
his fifteen-year-old son was experimenting with
cigarettes.
“Naturally, I didn’t want David to smoke,” Mr. Zerhusen
told us, “but his mother and I smoked cigarettes;
we were giving him a bad example all the time. I explained
to Dave how I started smoking at about his age
and how the nicotine had gotten the best of me and now
it was nearly impossible for me to stop. I reminded him
how irritating my cough was and how he had been after
me to give up cigarettes not many years before.
&quot;I didn’t exhort him to stop or make threats or warn
him about their dangers. All I did was point out how I
was hooked on cigarettes and what it had meant to me.
“He thought about it for a while and decided he
wouldn’t smoke until he had graduated from high
school. As the years went by David never did start smoking
and has no intention of ever doing so.
“As a result of that conversation I made the decision
to stop smoking cigarettes myself, and with the support
of my family, I have succeeded.”
A good leader follows this principle:
PRINCIPLE 3Talk about your own mistakes beforecriticizing the other person.NO ONE LIKES TO TAKE ORDERS
I once had the pleasure of dining with Miss Ida Tarbell,
the dean of American biographers. When I told her I was
writing this book, we began discussing this all-important
subject of getting along with people, and she told me
that while she was writing her biography of Owen D.
Young, she interviewed a man who had sat for three
years in the same office with Mr. Young. This man declared
that during all that time he had never heard Owen
D. Young give a direct order to anyone. He always gave
suggestions, not orders. Owen D. Young never said, for
example, “Do this or do that,” or “Don’t do this or don’t
do that.” He would say, “You might consider this,” or
“Do you think that would work?” Frequently he would
say, after he had dictated a letter, “What do you think of
this?” In looking over a letter of one of his assistants, he
would say, “Maybe if we were to phrase it this way it
would be better.” He always gave people the opportunity
to do things themselves; he never told his assistants
to do things; he let them do them, let them learn from
their mistakes.
A technique like that makes it easy for a person to
correct errors. A technique like that saves a person’s
pride and gives him or her a feeling of importance. It
encourages cooperation instead of rebellion.
Resentment caused by a brash order may last a long
time -even if the order was given to correct an obviously
bad situation. Dan Santarelli, a teacher at a vocational
school in Wyoming, Pennsylvania, told one of
our classes how one of his students had blocked the entrance
way to one of the school’s shops by illegally parking
his car in it. One of the other instructors stormed into
the classroom and asked in an arrogant tone, “Whose car
is blocking the driveway?&quot; When the student who
owned the car responded, the instructor screamed:
“Move that car and move it right now, or I’ll wrap a
chain around it and drag it out of there.”
Now that student was wrong. The car should not have
been parked there. But from that day on, not only did
that student resent the instructor’s action, but all the
students in the class did everything they could to give
the instructor a hard time and make his job unpleasant.
How could he have handled it differently? If he had
asked in a friendly way, “Whose car is in the driveway?”
and then suggested that if it were moved, other cars
could get in and out, the student would have gladly
moved it and neither he nor his classmates would have
been upset and resentful.
Asking questions not only makes an order more palatable;
it often stimulates the creativity of the persons
whom you ask. People are more likely to accept an order
if they have had a part in the decision that caused the
order to be issued.
When Ian Macdonald of Johannesburg, South Africa,
the general manager of a small manufacturing plant specializing
in precision machine parts, had the opportunity
to accept a very large order, he was convinced that he
would not meet the promised delivery date. The work
already scheduled in the shop and the short completion
time needed for this order made it seem impossible for
him to accept the order.
Instead of pushing his people to accelerate their work
and rush the order through, he called everybody together,
explained the situation to them, and told them
how much it would mean to the company and to them if
they could make it possible to produce the order on
time. Then he started asking questions:
“Is there anything we can do to handle this order?”
“Can anyone think of different ways to process it
through the shop that will make it possible to take the
order?”
“Is there any way to adjust our hours or personnel
assignments that would help?”
The employees came up with many ideas and insisted
that he take the order. They approached it with a “We
can do it” attitude, and the order was accepted, produced
and delivered on time.
An effective leader will use . . .
PRINCIPLE 4Ask questions instead of giving direct orders.LET THE OTHER PERSON SAVE FACE
Years ago the General Electric Company was faced with
the delicate task of removing Charles Steinmetz from
the head of a department. Steinmetz, a genius of the first
magnitude when it came to electricity, was a failure as
the head of the calculating department. Yet the company
didn’t dare offend the man. He was indispensable - and
highly sensitive. So they gave him a new title. They
made him Consulting Engineer of the General Electric
Company - a new title for work he was already doing -
and let someone else head up the department.
Steinmetz was happy.
So were the officers of G.E. They had gently maneuvered
their most temperamental star, and they had done
it without a storm - by letting him save face.
Letting one save face! How important, how vitally important
that is! And how few of us ever stop to think of
it! We ride roughshod over the feelings of others, getting
our own way, finding fault, issuing threats, criticizing a
child or an employee in front of others, without even
considering the hurt to the other person’s pride.
Whereas a few minutes’ thought, a considerate word or
two, a genuine understanding of the other person’s attitude,
would go so far toward alleviating the sting!
Let’s remember that the next time we are faced with
the distasteful necessity of discharging or reprimanding
an employee.
“Firing employees is not much fun. Getting fired is
even less fun.” (I’m quoting now from a letter written
me by Marshall A. Granger, a certified public accountant.)
“Our business is mostly seasonal. Therefore we
have to let a lot of people go after the income tax rush is
over.
It’s a byword in our profession that no one enjoys
wielding the ax. Consequently, the custom has developed
of getting it over as soon as possible, and usually
in the following way: ‘Sit down, Mr. Smith. The season’s
over, and we don’t seem to see any more assignments for
you. Of course, you understood you were only employed
for the busy season anyhow, etc., etc.’
“The effect on these people is one of disappointment
and a feeling of being ‘let down.’ Most of them are in the
accounting field for life, and they retain no particular
love for the firm that drops them so casually.
“I recently decided to let our seasonal personnel go
with a little more tact and consideration. So I call each
one in only after carefully thinking over his or her work
during the winter. And I’ve said something like this:
‘Mr. Smith, you’ve done a fine job (if he has). That time
we sent you to Newark, you had a tough assignment.
You were on the spot, but you came through with flying
colors, and we want you to know the firm is proud of
you. You’ve got the stuff - you’re going a long way,
wherever you’re working. This firm believes in you, and
is rooting for you, and we don’t want you to forget it.’
“Effect? The people go away feeling a lot better about
being fired. They don’t feel ‘let down.’ They know if we
had work for them, we’d keep them on. And when we
need them again, they come to us with a keen personal
affection.”
At one session of our course, two class members discussed
the negative effects of faultfinding versus the
positive effects of letting the other person save face.
Fred Clark of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, told of an incident
that occurred in his company: “At one of our production
meetings, a vice president was asking very
pointed questions of one of our production supervisors
regarding a production process. His tone of voice was
aggressive and aimed at pointing out faulty performance
on the part of the supervisor. Not wanting to be embarrassed
in front of his peers, the supervisor was evasive
in his responses. This caused the vice president to lose
his temper, berate the supervisor and accuse him of
lying.
“Any working relationship that might have existed
prior to this encounter was destroyed in a few brief moments.
This supervisor, who was basically a good
worker, was useless to our company from that time on. A
few months later he left our firm and went to work for a
competitor, where I understand he is doing a fine job.”
Another class member, Anna Mazzone, related how a
similar incident had occurred at her job - but what a
difference in approach and results! Ms. Mazzone, a marketing
specialist for a food packer, was given her first
major assignment - the test-marketing of a new product.
She told the class: “When the results of the test came in,
I was devastated. I had made a serious error in my planning,
and the entire test had to be done all over again.
To make this worse, I had no time to discuss it with my
boss before the meeting in which I was to make my
report on the project.
“When I was called on to give the report, I was shaking
with fright. I had all I could do to keep from breaking
down, but I resolved I would not cry and have all those
men make remarks about women not being able to handle
a management job because they are too emotional. I
made my report briefly and stated that due to an error I
would repeat the study before the next meeting. I sat
down, expecting my boss to blow up.
“Instead, he thanked me for my work and remarked
that it was not unusual for a person to make an error on
a new project and that he had confidence that the repeat
survey would be accurate and meaningful to the company.
He Assured me, in front of all my colleagues, that
he had faith in me and I knew I had done my best, and
that my lack of experience, not my lack of ability, was
the reason for the failure.
I left that meeting with my head in the air and
with the determination that I would never let that boss
of mine down again.”
Even if we are right and the other person is definitely
wrong, we only destroy ego by causing someone to lose
face. The legendary French aviation pioneer and author
Antoine de Saint-Exupéry wrote: &quot;I have no right to say
or do anything that diminishes a man in his own eyes.
What matters is not what I think of him, but what he
thinks of himself. Hurting a man in his dignity is a
crime.”
A real leader will always follow . . .
PRINCIPLE 5 Let the other person save face.HOW TO SPUR PEOPLE ONTO SUCCESS
Pete Barlow was an old friend of mine. He had a dog-and-
pony act and spent his life traveling with circuses
and vaudeville shows. I loved to watch Pete train new
dogs for his act. I noticed that the moment a dog showed
the slightest improvement, Pete patted and praised
him and gave him meat and made a great to-do about
it.
That’s nothing new. Animal trainers have been using
that same technique for centuries.
Why, I wonder, don’t we use the same common sense
when trying to change people that we use when trying
to change dogs? Why don’t we use meat instead of a
whip? Why don’t we use praise instead of condemnation?
Let us praise even the slightest improvement. That
inspires the other person to keep on improving.
In his book I Ain’t Much, Baby-But I’m All IGot,
the psychologist Jess Lair comments: “Praise is like sunlight
to the warm human spirit; we cannot flower and
grow without it. And yet, while most of us are only too
ready to apply to others the cold wind of criticism, we
are somehow reluctant to give our fellow the warm sunshine
of praise.” *</li></ul><ul><li>Jess Lair, I Ain’t Much, Baby - But I’m All I Got (Greenwich, Conn.:
Fawcett, 1976), p . 248.
I can look back at my own life and see where a few
words of praise have sharply changed my entire future.
Can’t you say the same thing about your life? History is
replete with striking illustrations of the sheer witchery
raise.
For example, many years ago a boy of ten was working
in a factory in Naples, He longed to be a singer, but his
first teacher discouraged him. “You can’t sing,” he said.
&quot;You haven’t any voice at all. It sounds like the wind in
the shutters.”
But his mother, a poor peasant woman, put her arms
about him and praised him and told him she knew he
could sing, she could already see an improvement, and
she went barefoot in order to save money to pay for his
music lessons. That peasant mother’s praise and encouragement
changed that boy’s life. His name was Enrico
Caruso, and he became the greatest and most
famous opera singer of his age.
In the early nineteenth century, a young man in London
aspired to be a writer. But everything seemed to be
against him. He had never been able to attend school
more than four years. His father had been flung in jail
because he couldn’t pay his debts, and this young man
often knew the pangs of hunger. Finally, he got a job
pasting labels on bottles of blacking in a rat-infested
warehouse, and he slept at night in a dismal attic room
with two other boys - guttersnipes from the slums of
London. He had so little confidence in his ability to
write that he sneaked out and mailed his first manuscript
in the dead of night so nobody would laugh at him. Story
after story was refused. Finally the great day came when
one was accepted. True, he wasn’t paid a shilling for it,
but one editor had praised him. One editor had given
him recognition. He was so thrilled that he wandered
aimlessly around the streets with tears rolling down his
cheeks.
The praise, the recognition, that he received through
getting one story in print, changed his whole life, for if
it hadn’t been for that encouragement, he might have
spent his entire life working in rat-infested factories.
You may have heard of that boy. His name was Charles
Dickens.
Another boy in London made his living as a clerk in a
dry-goods store. He had to get up at five o’clock, sweep
out the store, and slave for fourteen hours a day. It was
sheer drudgery and he despised it. After two years, he
could stand it no longer, so he got up one morning and,
without waiting for breakfast, tramped fifteen miles to
talk to his mother, who was working as a housekeeper.
He was frantic. He pleaded with her. He wept. He
swore he would kill himself if he had to remain in the
shop any longer. Then he wrote a long, pathetic letter to
his old schoolmaster, declaring that he was heartbroken,
that he no longer wanted to live. His old schoolmaster
gave him a little praise and assured him that he really
was very intelligent and fitted for finer things and offered
him a job as a teacher.
That praise changed the future of that boy and made a
lasting impression on the history of English literature.
For that boy went on to write innumerable best-selling
books and made over a million dollars with his pen.
You’ve probably heard of him. His name: H. G. Wells.
Use of praise instead of criticism is the basic concept
of B. F. Skinner’s teachings. This great contemporary
psychologist has shown by experiments with animals
and with humans that when criticism is minimized and
praise emphasized, the good things people do will be
reinforced and the poorer things will atrophy for lack of
attention.
John Ringelspaugh of Rocky Mount, North Carolina,
used this in dealing with his children. It seemed that, as
in so many families, mother and dad’s chief form of communication
with the children was yelling at them. And,
as in so many cases, the children became a little worse
rather than better after each such session - and so did
the parents. There seemed to be no end in sight for this
problem.
Mr. Ringelspaugh determined to use some of the principles
he was learning in our course to solve this situation.
He reported: “We decided to try praise instead of
harping on their faults. It wasn’t easy when all we could
see were the negative things they were doing; it was
really tough to find things to praise. We managed to find
something, and within the first day or two some of the
really upsetting things they were doing quit happening.
Then some of their other faults began to disappear. They
began capitalizing on the praise we were giving them.
They even began going out of their way to do things
right. Neither of us could believe it. Of course, it didn’t
last forever, but the norm reached after things leveled
off was so much better. It was no longer necessary to
react the way we used to. The children were doing far
more right things than wrong ones.” All of this was a
result of praising the slightest improvement in the children
rather than condemning everything they did wrong.
This works on the job too. Keith Roper of Woodland
Hills, California, applied this principle to a situation in
his company. Some material came to him in his print
shop which was of exceptionally high quality. The
printer who had done this job was a new employee who
had been having difficulty adjusting to the job. His supervisor
was upset about what he considered a negative
attitude and was seriously thinking of terminating his
services.
When Mr. Roper was informed of this situation, he
personally went over to the print shop and had a talk
with the young man. He told him how pleased he was
with the work he had just received and pointed out it
was the best work he had seen produced in that shop for
some time. He pointed out exactly why it was superior
and how important the young man’s contribution was to
the company,
Do you think this affected that young printer’s attitude
toward the company? Within days there was a complete
turnabout. He told several of his co-workers about the
conversation and how someone in the company really
appreciated good work. And from that day on, he was a
loyal and dedicated worker.
What Mr. Roper did was not just flatter the young
printer and say “You’re good.” He specifically pointed
out how his work was superior. Because he had singled
out a specific accomplishment, rather than just making
general flattering remarks, his praise became much more
meaningful to the person to whom it was given. Everybody
likes to be praised, but when praise is specific, it
comes across as sincere - not something the other person
may be saying just to make one feel good.
Remember, we all crave appreciation and recognition,
and will do almost anything to get it. But nobody wants
insincerity. Nobody wants flattery.
Let me repeat: The principles taught in this book will
work only when they come from the heart. I am not
advocating a bag of tricks. I am talking about a new way
of life.
Talk about changing people. If you and I will inspire
the people with whom we come in contact to a realization
of the hidden treasures they possess, we can do far
more than change people. We can literally transform
them.
Exaggeration? Then listen to these sage words from
William James, one of the most distinguished psychologists
and philosophers America has ever produced:
Compared with what we ought to be, we are only half
awake. We are making use of only a small part of our physical
and mental resources. Stating the thing broadly, the
human individual thus lives far within his limits. He possesses
powers of various sorts which he habitually fails to use.
Yes, you who are reading these lines possess powers
of various sorts which you habitually fail to use; and one
of these powers you are probably not using to the fullest
extent is your magic ability to praise people and inspire
them with a realization of their latent possibilities.
Abilities wither under criticism; they blossom under
encouragement. To become a more effective leader of
people, apply . . .
PRINCIPLE 6Praise the slightest improvement and praiseevery improvement. Be “hearty in yourapprobation and lavish in your praise.”GIVE A DOG A GOOD NAMEWhat do you do when a person who has been a good
worker begins to turn in shoddy work? You can fire him
or her, but that really doesn’t solve anything. You can
berate the worker, but this usually causes resentment.
Henry Henke, a service manager for a large truck dealership
in Lowell, Indiana, had a mechanic whose
work had become less than satisfactory. Instead of
bawling him out or threatening him, Mr. Henke called
him into his office and had a heart-to-heart talk with
him.
“Bill,” he said, “you are a fine mechanic. You have
been in this line of work for a good number of years. You
have repaired many vehicles to the customers’ satisfaction.
In fact, we’ve had a number of compliments about
the good work you have done. Yet, of late, the time you
take to complete each job has been increasing and your
work has not been up to your own old standards. Because
you have been such an outstanding mechanic in
the past, I felt sure you would want to know that I am
not happy with this situation, and perhaps jointly we
could find some way to correct the problem.”
Bill responded that he hadn’t realized he had been
falling down in his duties and assured his boss that the
work he was getting was not out of his range of expertise
and he would try to improve in the future.
Did he do it? You can be sure he did. He once again
became a fast and thorough mechanic. With that reputation
Mr. Henke had given him to live up to, how could
he do anything else but turn out work comparable to that
which he had done in the past.
“The average person,” said Samuel Vauclain, then
president of the Baldwin Locomotive Works, &quot;can be
led readily if you have his or her respect and if you show
that you respect that person for some kind of ability.”
In short, if you want to improve a person in a certain
spect, act as though that particular trait were already
one of his or her outstanding characteristics. Shakespeare
said “Assume a virtue, if you have it not.” And it
might be well to assume and state openly that other people
have the virtue you want them to develop. Give
them a fine reputation to live up to, and they will make
prodigious efforts rather than see you disillusioned.
Georgette Leblanc, in her book Souvenirs, My Life
with Maeterlinck, describes the startling transformation
of a humble Belgian Cinderella.
“A servant girl from a neighboring hotel brought my
meals,” she wrote. “She was called ‘Marie the Dish
washer’ because she had started her career as a scullery
assistant. She was a kind of monster, cross-eyed, bandylegged,
poor in flesh and spirit.
“One day, while she was holding my plate of macaroni
in her red hand, I said to her point-blank, ‘Marie, you do
not know what treasures are within you.’
“Accustomed to holding back her emotion, Marie
waited a few moments, not daring to risk the slightest
gesture for fear of a castastrophe. Then she put the dish
on the table, sighed and said ingenuously, ‘Madame, I
would never have believed it.’ She did not doubt, she
did not ask a question. She simply went back to the
kitchen and repeated what I had said, and such is the
force of faith that no one made fun of her. From that day
on, she was even given a certain consideration. But the
most curious change of all occurred in the humble Marie
herself. Believing she was the tabernacle of unseen marvels, she began taking care of her face and body so carefully that her starved youth seemed to bloom and
modestly hide her plainness.
“Two months later, she announced her coming marriage
with the nephew of the chef. ‘I’m going to be a
lady,’ she said, and thanked me. A small phrase had
changed her entire life.”
Georgette Leblanc had given “Marie the Dishwasher”
a reputation to live up to - and that reputation had transformed
her.
Bill Parker, a sales representative for a food company
in Daytona Beach, Florida, was very excited about the
new line of products his company was introducing and
was upset when the manager of a large independent
food market turned down the opportunity to carry it in
his store. Bill brooded all day over this rejection and
decided to return to the store before he went home that
evening and try again.
“Jack,” he said, “since I left this morning I realized I
hadn’t given you the entire picture of our new line, and
I would appreciate some of your time to tell you about
the points I omitted. I have respected the fact that you
are always willing to listen and are big enough to change
your mind when the facts warrant a change.”
Could Jack refuse to give him another hearing? Not
with that reputation to live up to.
One morning Dr. Martin Fitzhugh, a dentist in Dublin,
Ireland, was shocked when one of his patients
pointed out to him that the metal cup holder which she
was using to rinse her mouth was not very clean. True,
the patient drank from the paper cup, not the holder, but
it certainly was not professional to use tarnished equipment.
When the patient left, Dr. Fitzhugh retreated to his
private office to write a note to Bridgit, the charwoman,
who came twice a week to clean his office. He wrote:
My dear Bridgit,
I see you so seldom, I thought I’d take the time to thank
you for the fine job of cleaning you’ve been doing. By the
way, I thought I’d mention that since two hours, twice a
week, is a very limited amount of time, please feel free to
work an extra half hour from time to time if you feel you
need to do those “once-in-a-while” things like polishing
the cup holders and the like. I, of course, will pay you for
the extra time.
“The next day, when I walked into my office,” Dr.
Fitzhugh reported, &quot;My desk had been polished to a
mirror-like finish, as had my chair, which I nearly slid
out of. When I went into the treatment room I found the
shiniest, cleanest chrome-plated cup holder I had ever
seen nestled in its receptacle. I had given my char-woman
a fine reputation to live up to, and because of
this small gesture she outperformed all her past efforts.
How much additional time did she spend on this? That’s
right-none at all .&quot;
There is an old saying: “Give a dog a bad name and
you may as well hang him.” But give him a good name</li></ul><ul><li>and see what happens!
When Mrs. Ruth Hopkins, a fourth-grade teacher in
Brooklyn, New York, looked at her class roster the first
day of school, her excitement and joy of starting a new
term was tinged with anxiety. In her class this year she
would have Tommy T., the school’s most notorious “bad
boy.” His third-grade teacher had constantly complained
about Tommy to colleagues, the principal and
anyone else who would listen. He was not just mischievous;
he caused serious discipline problems in the class,
picked fights with the boys, teased the girls, was fresh to
the teacher, and seemed to get worse as he grew older.
His only redeeming feature was his ability to learn rapidly
and master the-school work easily.
Mrs. Hopkins decided to face the “Tommy problem”
immediately. When she greeted her new students, she
made little comments to each of them: “Rose, that’s a
pretty dress you are wearing,” “Alicia, I hear you draw
beautifully.” When she came to Tommy, she looked him
straight in the eyes and said, “Tommy, I understand you
are a natural leader. I’m going to depend on you to help
me make this class the best class in the fourth grade this
year.” She reinforced this over the first few days by complimenting
Tommy on everything he did and commenting
on how this showed what a good student he was.
With that reputation to live up to, even a nine-year-old
couldn’t let her down - and he didn’t.

PRINCIPLE 7Give the other person a fine reputation to liveup to.MAKE THE FAULT SEEMEASY TO CORRECTA bachelor friend of mine, about forty years old, became
engaged, and his fiancée persuaded him to take some
belated dancing lessons. “The Lord knows I needed
dancing lessons,” he confessed as he told me the story,
“for I danced just as I did when I first started twenty
years ago. The first teacher I engaged probably told me
the truth. She said I was all wrong; I would just have to
forget everything and begin all over again. But that took
the heart out of me. I had no incentive to go on. So I quit
her.
“The next teacher may have been lying, but I liked it.
She said nonchalantly that my dancing was a bit old-fashioned
perhaps, but the fundamentals were all right,
and she assured me I wouldn’t have any trouble learning
a few new steps. The first teacher had discouraged me
by emphasizing my mistakes. This new teacher did the
opposite. She kept praising the things I did right and
minimizing my errors. ‘You have a natural sense of
rhythm,’ she assured me. ‘You really are a natural-born
dancer.’ Now my common sense tells me that I always
have been and always will be a fourth-rate dancer; yet,
deep in my heart, I still like to think that maybe she
meant it. To be sure, I was paying her to say it; but why
bring that up?
“At any rate, I know I am a better dancer than I would
have been if she hadn’t told me I had a natural sense of
rhythm. That encouraged me. That gave me hope. That
made me want to improve.”
Tell your child, your spouse, or your employee that he
or she is stupid or dumb at a certain thing, has no gift for
it, and is doing it all wrong, and you have destroyed
almost every incentive to try to improve. But use the
opposite technique - be liberal with your encouragement,
make the thing seem easy to do, let the other person
know that you have faith in his ability to do it, that
he has an undeveloped flair for it - and he will practice
until the dawn comes in the window in order to excel.
Lowell Thomas, a superb artist in human relations,
used this technique, He gave you confidence, inspired
you with courage and faith. For example, I spent a weekend
with Mr. and Mrs. Thomas; and on Saturday night,
I was asked to sit in on a friendly bridge game before a
roaring fire. Bridge? Oh, no! No! No! Not me. I knew
nothing about it. The game had always been a black
mystery to me, No! No! Impossible!
“Why, Dale, it is no trick at all,” Lowell replied.
“There is nothing to bridge except memory and judgment.
You’ve written articles on memory. Bridge will be
a cinch for you. It’s right up your alley.”
And presto, almost before I realized what I was doing,
I found myself for the first time at a bridge table. All
because I was told I had a natural flair for it and the
game was made to seem easy.
Speaking of bridge reminds me of Ely Culbertson,
whose books on bridge have been translated into a
dozen languages and have sold more than a million copies.
Yet he told me he never would have made a profession
out of the game if a certain young woman hadn’t
assured him he had a flair for it.
When he came to America in 1922, he tried to get a job
teaching in philosophy and sociology, but he couldn’t.
Then he tried selling coal, and he failed at that
Then he tried selling coffee, and he failed at that, too.
He had played some bridge, but it had never occurred
to him in those days that someday he would teach it. He
was not only a poor card player, but he was also very
stubborn. He asked so many questions and held so many
post-mortem examinations that no one wanted to play
with him.
Then he met a pretty bridge teacher, Josephine Dillon,
fell in love and married her. She noticed how carefully
he analyzed his cards and persuaded him that he
was a potential genius at the card table. It was that encouragement
and that alone, Culbertson told me, that
caused him to make a profession of bridge.
Clarence M. Jones, one of the instructors of our course
in Cincinnati, Ohio, told how encouragement and making
faults seem easy to correct completely changed the
life of his son.
“In 1970 my son David, who was then fifteen years
old, came to live with me in Cincinnati. He had led a
rough life. In 1958 his head was cut open in a car accident,
leaving a very bad scar on his forehead. In 1960
his mother and I were divorced and he moved to Dallas,
Texas, with his mother. Until he was fifteen he had spent
most of his school years in special classes for slow learners
in the Dallas school system. Possibly because of the
scar, school administrators had decided he was brain-injured
and could not function at a normal level. He was
two years behind his age group, so he was only in the
seventh grade. Yet he did not know his multiplication
tables, added on his fingers and could barely read.
“There was one positive point. He loved to work on
radio and TV sets. He wanted to become a TV technician.
I encouraged this and pointed out that he needed
math to qualify for the training. I decided to help him
become proficient in this subject. We obtained four sets
of flash cards: multiplication, division, addition and subtraction.
As we went through the cards, we put the correct
answers in a discard stack. When David missed one,
I gave him the correct answer and then put the card in
the repeat stack until there were no cards left. I made a
big deal out of each card he got right, particularly if he
had missed it previously. Each night we would go
through the repeat stack until there were no cards left.
Each night we timed the exercise with a stop watch. I
promised him that when he could get all the cards correct
in eight minutes with no incorrect answers, we
would quit doing it every night. This seemed an impossible
goal to David. The first night it took 52 minutes,
the second night, 48, then 45, 44, 41 then under 40 minutes.
We celebrated each reduction. I’d call in my wife,
and we would both hug him and we’d all dance a jig. At
the end of the month he was doing all the cards perfectly
in less than eight minutes. When he made a small improvement
he would ask to do it again. He had made the
fantastic discovery that learning was easy and fun.
“Naturally his grades in algebra took a jump. It is
amazing how much easier algebra is when you can multiply.
He astonished himself by bringing home a B in
math. That had never happened before. Other changes
came with almost unbelievable rapidity. His reading improved
rapidly, and he began to use his natural talents
in drawing. Later in the school year his science teacher
assigned him to develop an exhibit. He chose to develop
a highly complex series of models to demonstrate the
effect of levers. It required skill not only in drawing and
model making but in applied mathematics. The exhibit
took first prize in his school’s science fair and was entered
in the city competition and won third prize for the
entire city of Cincinnati.
“That did it. Here was a kid who had flunked two
grades, who had been told he was ‘brain-damaged,’ who
had been called ‘Frankenstein’ by his classmates and
told his brains must have leaked out of the cut on his
head. Suddenly he discovered he could really learn and
accomplish things. The result? From the last quarter of
the eighth grade all the way through high school, he
never failed to make the honor roll; in high school he
was elected to the national honor society. Once he found
learning was easy, his whole life changed.”
If you want to help others to improve, remember . . .
PRINCIPLE 8Use encouragement. Make the fault seemeasy to correct.
MAKING PEOPLE GLAD TO DOWHAT YOU WANTBack in 1915, America was aghast. For more than a year,
the nations of Europe had been slaughtering one another
on a scale never before dreamed of in all the
bloody annals of mankind. Could peace be brought
about? No one knew. But Woodrow Wilson was determined
to try. He would send a personal representative,
a peace emissary, to counsel with the warlords of Europe.
William Jennings Bryan, secretary of state, Bryan, the
peace advocate, longed to go. He saw a chance to perform
a great service and make his name immortal. But
Wilson appointed another man, his intimate friend and
advisor Colonel Edward M. House; and it was House’s
thorny task to break the unwelcome news to Bryan without
giving him offense.
“Bryan was distinctly disappointed when he heard I
was to go to Europe as the peace emissary,” Colonel
House records in his diary. “He said he had planned to
do this himself . . .
&quot;I replied that the President thought it would be unwise
for anyone to do this officially, and that his going
would attract a great deal of attention and people
would wonder why he was there. . . .&quot;
You see the intimation? House practically told Bryan
that he was too important for the job - and Bryan was
satisfied.
Colonel House, adroit, experienced in the ways of the
world, was following one of the important rules of
human relations: Always make the other person happy
about doing the thing you suggest.
Woodrow Wilson followed that policy even when inviting
William Gibbs McAdoo to become a member of
his cabinet. That was the highest honor he could confer
upon anyone, and yet Wilson extended the invitation in
such a way as to make McAdoo feel doubly important.
Here is the story in McAdoo&#x27;s own words: “He <!-- -->[Wilson]<!-- -->
said that he was making up his cabinet and that he would
be very glad if I would accept a place in it as Secretary
of the Treasury. He had a delightful way of putting
things; he created the impression that by accepting this
great honor I would be doing him a favor.”
Unfortunately, Wilson didn’t always employ such taut.
If he had, history might have been different. For example,
Wilson didn’t make the Senate and the Republican
Party happy by entering the United States in the League
of Nations. Wilson refused to take such prominent Republican
leaders as Elihu Root or Charles Evans Hughes
or Henry Cabot Lodge to the peace conference with
him. Instead, he took along unknown men from his own
party. He snubbed the Republicans, refused to let them
feel that the League was their idea as well as his, refused
to let them have a finger in the pie; and, as a result of
this crude handling of human relations, wrecked his own
career, ruined his health, shortened his life, caused
America to stay out of the League, and altered the history
of the world.
Statesmen and diplomats aren’t the only ones who use
this make-a-person-happy-yo-do-things-you-want-them-to-
do approach. Dale O. Ferrier of Fort Wayne, Indiana,
told how he encouraged one of his young children to
willingly do the chore he was assigned.
“One of Jeff’s chores was to pick up pears from under
the pear tree so the person who was mowing underneath
wouldn’t have to stop to pick them up. He didn’t like
this chore, and frequently it was either not done at all or
it was done so poorly that the mower had to stop and
pick up several pears that he had missed. Rather than
have an eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation about it, one
day I said to him: ‘Jeff, I’ll make a deal with you. For
every bushel basket full of pears you pick up, I’ll pay
you one dollar. But after you are finished, for every pear
I find left in the yard, I’ll take away a dollar. How does
that sound?’ As you would expect, he not only picked up
all of the pears, but I had to keep an eye on him to see
that he didn’t pull a few off the trees to fill up some of
the baskets.”
I knew a man who had to refuse many invitations to
speak, invitations extended by friends, invitations coming
from people to whom he was obligated; and yet he
did it so adroitly that the other person was at least contented
with his refusal. How did he do it? Not by merely
talking about the fact that he was too busy and too-this
and too-that. No, after expressing his appreciation of the
invitation and regretting his inability to accept it, he suggested
a substitute speaker. In other words, he didn’t
give the other person any time to feel unhappy about the
refusal, He immediately changed the other person’s
thoughts to some other speaker who could accept the
invitation.
Gunter Schmidt, who took our course in West Germany,
told of an employee in the food store he managed
who was negligent about putting the proper price tags
on the shelves where the items were displayed. This
caused confusion and customer complaints. Reminders,
admonitions, confrontations, with her about this did not
do much good. Finally, Mr. Schmidt called her into his
office and told her he was appointing her Supervisor of
Price Tag Posting for the entire store and she would be
responsible for keeping all of the shelves properly
tagged. This new responsibility and title changed her
attitude completely, and she fulfiled her duties satisfactorily
from then on.
Childish? Perhaps. But that is what they said to Napoleon
when he created the Legion of Honor and distributed
15,000 crosses to his soldiers and made
eighteen of his generals “Marshals of France” and called
his troops the “Grand Army.” Napoleon was criticized
for giving “toys” to war-hardened veterans, and Napoleon
replied, “Men are ruled by toys.”
This technique of giving titles and authority worked
for Napoleon and it will work for you. For example, a
friend of mine, Mrs. Ernest Gent of Scarsdale, New
York, was troubled by boys running across and destroying
her lawn. She tried criticism. She tried coaxing. Neither
worked. Then she tried giving the worst sinner in
the gang a title and a feeling of authority. She made him
her “detective” and put him in charge of keeping all
trespassers off her lawn. That solved her problem. Her
“detective” built a bonfire in the backyard, heated an
iron red hot, and threatened to brand any boy who
stepped on the lawn.
The effective leader should keep the following guidelines
in mind when it is necessary to change attitudes or
behavior:</li></ul><ol><li>Be sincere. Do not promise anything that you
cannot deliver. Forget about the benefits to yourself
and concentrate on the benefits to the other person.</li><li>Know exactly what it is you want the other person
to do.</li><li>Be empathetic. Ask yourself what is it the other
person really wants.</li><li>Consider the benefits that person will receive
from doing what you suggest.</li><li>Match those benefits to the other person’s wants.</li><li>When you make your request, put it in a form
that will convey to the other person the idea that he
personally will benefit. We could give a curt order like
this: &quot; John, we have customers coming in tomorrow
and I need the stockroom cleaned out. So sweep it out,
put the stock in neat piles on the shelves and polish
the counter.” Or we could express the same idea by
showing John the benefits he will get from doing the
task: “John, we have a job that should be completed
right away. If it is done now, we won’t be faced with
it later. I am bringing some customers in tomorrow to
show our facilities. I would like to show them the
stockroom, but it is in poor shape. If you could sweep
it out, put the stock in neat piles on the shelves, and
polish the counter, it would make us look efficient and
you will have done your part to provide a good company
image.”
Will John be happy about doing what you suggest?
Probably not very happy, but happier than if you had not
pointed out the benefits. Assuming you know that John
has pride in the way his stockroom looks and is interested
in contributing to the company image, he will be
more likely to be cooperative. It also will have been
pointed out to John that the job would have to be done
eventually and by doing it now, he won’t be faced with
it later.
It is naïve to believe you will always get a favorable
reaction from other persons when you use these approaches,
but the experience of most people shows that
you are more likely to change attitudes this way than by
not using these principles - and if you increase your successes
by even a mere 10 percent, you have become 10
percent more effective as a leader than you were before</li></ol><ul><li>and that is your benefit.
People are more likely to do what you would like them
to do when you use . . .
PRINCIPLE 9Make the other person happy about doingthe thing you suggest.
In a NutshellBE A LEADER
A leader’s job often includes changing your people’s
attitudes and behavior. Some suggestions to accomplish
this:

PRINCIPLE 3
Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other
person.
PRINCIPLE 4
Ask questions instead of giving direct orders.
PRINCIPLE 5
Let the other person save face.
PRINCIPLE 6

improvement. Be “hearty in your approbation and lavish in
your praise.”
PRINCIPLE 7
Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to.
PRINCIPLE 8
Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct.
PRINCIPLE 9
Make the other person happy about doing the thing you

A Shortcut to
Distinction
by Lowell ThomasThis biographical information about Dale Carnegie was
written as an introduction to the original edition of
How to Win Friends and Influence People. It is reprinted
in this edition to give the readers additional
background on Dale Carnegie.
It was a cold January night in 1935, but the weather
couldn’t keep them away. Two thousand five hundred
men and women thronged into the grand ballroom of the
Hotel Pennsylvania in New York. Every available seat
was filled by half-past seven. At eight o’clock, the eager
crowd was still pouring in. The spacious balcony was
soon jammed. Presently even standing space was at a
premium, and hundreds of people, tired after navigating
a day in business, stood up for an hour and a half that
night to witness - what?
A fashion show?
A six-day bicycle race or a personal appearance by
Clark Gable?
No. These people had been lured there by a newspaper
ad. Two evenings previously, they had seen this
full-page announcement in the New York Sunstaring
them in the face:
Learn to Speak Effectively
Prepare for Leadership
Old stuff? Yes, but believe it or not, in the most sophisticated
town on earth, during a depression with 20
percent of the population on relief, twenty-five hundred
people had left their homes and hustled to the hotel in
response to that ad.
The people who responded were of the upper economic
strata - executives, employers and professionals.
These men and women had come to hear the opening
gun of an ultramodern, ultrapractical course in “Effective
Speaking and Influencing Men in Business”- a
course given by the Dale Carnegie Institute of Effective
Speaking and Human Relations.
Why were they there, these twenty-five hundred business
men and women?
Because of a sudden hunger for more education because
of the depression?
Apparently not, for this same course had been playing
to packed houses in New York City every season for the
preceding twenty-four years. During that time, more
than fifteen thousand business and professional people
had been trained by Dale Carnegie. Even large, skeptical,
conservative organizations such as the Westinghouse
Electric Company, the McGraw-Hill Publishing
Company, the Brooklyn Union Gas Company, the
Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, the American Institute
of Electrical Engineers and the New York Telephone
Company have had this training conducted in
their own offices for the benefit of their members and
executives.
The fact that these people, ten or twenty years after
leaving grade school, high school or college, come and
take this training is a glaring commentary on the shocking
deficiencies of our educational system.
What do adults really want to study?That is an important
question; and in order to answer it, the University
of Chicago, the American Association for Adult Education,
and the United Y.M.C.A. Schools made a survey
over a two-year period.
That survey revealed that the prime interest of adults
is health. It also revealed that their second interest is in
developing skill in human relationships - they want to
learn the technique of getting along with and influencing
other people. They don’t want to become public
speakers, and they don’t want to listen to a lot of high
sounding talk about psychology; they want suggestions
they can use immediately in business, in social contacts
and in the home.
So that was what adults wanted to study, was it?
“All right,” said the people making the survey. &quot;Fine.
If that is what they want, we’ll give it to them.”
Looking around for a textbook, they discovered that
no working manual had ever been written to help people
solve their daily problems in human relationships.
Here was a fine kettle of fish! For hundreds of years,
learned volumes had been written on Greek and Latin
and higher mathematics - topics about which the average
adult doesn’t give two hoots. But on the one subject
on which he has a thirst for knowledge, a veritable passion
for guidance and help - nothing!
This explained the presence of twenty-five hundred
eager adults crowding into the grand ballroom of the
Hotel Pennsylvania in response to a newspaper advertisement.
Here, apparently, at last was the thing for
which they had long been seeking.
Back in high school and college, they had pored over
books, believing that knowledge alone was the open sesame
to financial - and professional rewards.
But a few years in the rough-and-tumble of business
and professional life had brought sharp dissillusionment.
They had seen some of the most important business
successes won by men who possessed, in addition
to their knowledge, the ability to talk well, to win people
to their way of thinking, and to &quot;sell&quot; themselves and
their ideas.
They soon discovered that if one aspired to wear the
captain’s cap and navigate the ship of business, personality
and the ability to talk are more important than a
knowledge of Latin verbs or a sheepskin from Harvard.
The advertisement in the New York Sun promised that
the meeting would be highly entertaining. It was.
Eighteen people who had taken the course were marshaled
in front of the loudspeaker - and fifteen of them
were given precisely seventy-five seconds each to tell
his or her story. Only seventy-five seconds of talk, then
“bang” went the gavel, and the chairman shouted,
“Time! Next speaker!”
The affair moved with the speed of a herd of buffalo
thundering across the plains. Spectators stood for an
hour and a half to watch the performance.
The speakers were a cross section of life: several sales
representatives, a chain store executive, a baker, the
president of a trade association, two bankers, an insurance
agent, an accountant, a dentist, an architect, a druggist
who had come from Indianapolis to New York to
take the course, a lawyer who had come from Havana in
order to prepare himself to give one important three-minute
speech.
The first speaker bore the Gaelic name Patrick J.
O&#x27;Haire. Born in Ireland, he attended school for only
four years, drifted to America, worked as a mechanic,
then as a chauffeur.
Now, however, he was forty, he had a growing family
and needed more money, so he tried selling trucks. Suffering
from an inferiority complex that, as he put it, was
eating his heart out, he had to walk up and down in front
of an office half a dozen times before he could summon
up enough courage to open the door. He was so discouraged
as a salesman that he was thinking of going back to
working with his hands in a machine shop, when one
day he received a letter inviting him to an organization
meeting of the Dale Carnegie Course in Effective
Speaking.
He didn’t want to attend. He feared he would have to
associate with a lot of college graduates, that he would
be out of place.
His despairing wife insisted that he go, saying, “It
may do you some good, Pat. God knows you need it.”
He went down to the place where the meeting was to be
held and stood on the sidewalk for five minutes before
he could generate enough self-confidence to enter the
room.
The first few times he tried to speak in front of the
others, he was dizzy with fear. But as the weeks drifted
by, he lost all fear of audiences and soon found that he
loved to talk - the bigger the crowd, the better. And he
also lost his fear of individuals and of his superiors. He
presented his ideas to them, and soon he had been advanced
into the sales department. He had become a valued
and much liked member of his company. This night,
in the Hotel Pennsylvania, Patrick O&#x27;Haire stood in front
of twenty-five hundred people and told a gay, rollicking
story of his achievements. Wave after wave of laughter
swept over the audience. Few professional speakers
could have equaled his performance.
The next speaker, Godfrey Meyer, was a gray-headed
banker, the father of eleven children. The first time he
had attempted to speak in class, he was literally struck
dumb. His mind refused to function. His story is a vivid
illustration of how leadership gravitates to the person
who can talk.
He worked on Wall Street, and for twenty-five years
he had been living in Clifton, New Jersey. During that
time, he had taken no active part in community affairs
and knew perhaps five hundred people.
Shortly after he had enrolled in the Carnegie course,
he received his tax bill and was infuriated by what he
considered unjust charges. Ordinarily, he would have
sat at home and fumed, or he would have taken it out in
grousing to his neighbors. But instead, he put on his hat
that night, walked into the town meeting, and blew off
steam in public.
As a result of that talk of indignation, the citizens of
Clifton, New Jersey, urged him to run for the town council.
So for weeks he went from one meeting to another,
denouncing waste and municipal extravagance.
There were ninety-six candidates in the field. When
the ballots were counted, lo, Godfrey Meyer’s name led
all the rest. Almost overnight, he had become a public
figure among the forty thousand people in his community.
As a result of his talks, he made eighty times more
friends in six weeks than he had been able to previously
in twenty-five years.
And his salary as councilman meant that he got a return
of 1,000 percent a year on his investment in the
Carnegie course.
The third speaker, the head of a large national association
of food manufacturers, told how he had been unable
to stand up and express his ideas at meetings of a
board of directors.
As a result of learning to think on his feet, two astonishing
things happened. He was soon made president of
his association, and in that capacity, he was obliged to
address meetings all over the United States. Excerpts
from his talks were put on the Associated Press wires
and printed in newspapers and trade magazines
throughout the country.
In two years, after learning to speak more effectively,
he received more free publicity for his company and its
products than he had been able to get previously with a
quarter of a million dollars spent in direct advertising.
This speaker admitted that he had formerly hesitated to
telephone some of the more important business executives
in Manhattan and invite them to lunch with him.
But as a result of the prestige he had acquired by his
talks, these same people telephoned him and invited
him to lunch and apologized to him for encroaching on
his time.
The ability to speak is a shortcut to distinction. It puts
a person in the limelight, raises one head and shoulders
above the crowd. And the person who can speak acceptably
is usually given credit for an ability out of all proportion
to what he or she really possesses.
A movement for adult education has been sweeping
over the nation; and the most spectacular force in that
movement was Dale Carnegie, a man who listened to
and critiqued more talks by adults than has any other
man in captivity. According to a cartoon by &quot;Believe-It-or-
Not” Ripley, he had criticized 150,000 speeches. If
that grand total doesn’t impress you, remember that it
meant one talk for almost every day that has passed since
Columbus discovered America. Or, to put it in other
words, if all the people who had spoken before him had
used only three minutes and had appeared before him
in succession, it would have taken ten months, listening
day and night, to hear them all.
Dale Carnegie’s own career, filled with sharp contrasts,
was a striking example of what a person can accomplish
when obsessed with an original idea and afire
with enthusiasm.
Born on a Missouri farm ten miles from a railway, he
never saw a streetcar until he was twelve years old; yet
by the time he was forty-six, he was familiar with the far-flung
corners of the earth, everywhere from Hong Kong
to Hammerfest; and, at one time, he approached closer
to the North Pole than Admiral Byrd’s headquarters at
Little America was to the South Pole.
This Missouri lad who had once picked strawberries
and cut cockleburs for five cents an hour became the
highly paid trainer of the executives of large corporations
in the art of self-expression.
This erstwhile cowboy who had once punched cattle
and branded calves and ridden fences out in western
South Dakota later went to London to put on shows
under the patronage of the royal family.
This chap who was a total failure the first half-dozen
times he tried to speak in public later became my personal
manager. Much of my success has been due to
training under Dale Carnegie.
Young Carnegie had to struggle for an education, for
hard luck was always battering away at the old farm in
northwest Missouri with a flying tackle and a body slam.
Year after year, the “102” River rose and drowned the
corn and swept away the hay. Season after season, the
fat hogs sickened and died from cholera, the bottom fell
out of the market for cattle and mules, and the bank
threatened to foreclose the mortgage.
Sick with discouragement, the family sold out and
bought another farm near the State Teachers’ College at
Warrensburg, Missouri. Board and room could be had in
town for a dollar a day, but young Carnegie couldn’t
afford it. So he stayed on the farm and commuted on
horseback three miles to college each day. At home, he
milked the cows, cut the wood, fed the hogs, and studied
his Latin verbs by the light of a coal-oil lamp until his
eyes blurred and he began to nod.
Even when he got to bed at midnight, he set the alarm
for three o’clock. His father bred pedigreed Duroc-Jersey
hogs - and there was danger, during the bitter
cold nights, that the young pigs would freeze to death;
so they were put in a basket, covered with a gunny sack,
and set behind the kitchen stove. True to their nature,
the pigs demanded a hot meal at 3 A.M. So when the
alarm went off, Dale Carnegie crawled out of the blankets,
took the basket of pigs out to their mother, waited
for them to nurse, and then brought them back to the
warmth of the kitchen stove.
There were six hundred students in State Teachers’
College, and Dale Carnegie was one of the isolated half-dozen
who couldn’t afford to board in town. He was
ashamed of the poverty that made it necessary for him to
ride back to the farm and milk the cows every night. He
was ashamed of his coat, which was too tight, and his
trousers, which were too short. Rapidly developing an
inferiority complex, he looked about for some shortcut
to distinction. He soon saw that there were certain
groups in college that enjoyed influence and prestige - the
football and baseball players and the chaps who won
the debating and public-speaking contests.
Realizing that he had no flair for athletics, he decided
to win one of the speaking contests. He spent months
preparing his talks. He practiced as he sat in the saddle
galloping to college and back; he practiced his speeches
as he milked the cows; and then he mounted a bale of
hay in the barn and with great gusto and gestures harangued
the frightened pigeons about the issues of the
day.
But in spite of all his earnestness and preparation, he
met with defeat after defeat. He was eighteen at the time</li><li>sensitive and proud. He became so discouraged, so
depressed, that he even thought of suicide. And then
suddenly he began to win, not one contest, but every
speaking contest in college.
Other students pleaded with him to train them; and
they won also.
After graduating from college, he started selling
correspondence courses to the ranchers among the sand
hills of western Nebraska and eastern Wyoming. In spite
of all his boundless energy and enthusiasm, he couldn’t
make the grade. He became so discouraged that he went
to his hotel room in Alliance, Nebraska, in the middle of
the day, threw himself across the bed, and wept in despair.
He longed to go back to college, he longed to
retreat from the harsh battle of life; but he couldn’t. So
he resolved to go to Omaha and get another job. He
didn’t have the money for a railroad ticket, so he traveled
on a freight train, feeding and watering two carloads of
wild horses in return for his passage, After landing in
south Omaha, he got a job selling bacon and soap and
lard for Armour and Company. His territory was up
among the Badlands and the cow and Indian country of
western South Dakota. He covered his territory by
freight train and stage coach and horseback and slept in
pioneer hotels where the only partition between the
rooms was a sheet of muslin. He studied books on salesmanship,
rode bucking bronchos, played poker with the
Indians, and learned how to collect money. And when,
for example, an inland storekeeper couldn’t pay cash for
the bacon and hams he had ordered, Dale Carnegie
would take a dozen pairs of shoes off his shelf, sell the
shoes to the railroad men, and forward the receipts to
Armour and Company.
He would often ride a freight train a hundred miles a
day. When the train stopped to unload freight, he would
dash uptown, see three or four merchants, get his orders;
and when the whistle blew, he would dash down the
street again lickety-split and swing onto the train while
it was moving.
Within two years, he had taken an unproductive territory
that had stood in the twenty-fifth place and had
boosted it to first place among all the twenty-nine car
routes leading out of south Omaha. Armour and Company
offered to promote him, saying: “You have
achieved what seemed impossible.” But he refused the
promotion and resigned, went to New York, studied at
the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, and toured the
country, playing the role of Dr. Hartley in Polly of the
Circus.
He would never be a Booth or a Barrymore. He had
the good sense to recognize that, So back he went to
sales work, selling automobiles and trucks for the Packard
Motor Car Company.
He knew nothing about machinery and cared nothing
about it. Dreadfully unhappy, he had to scourge himself
to his task each day. He longed to have time to study, to
write the books he had dreamed about writing back in
college. So he resigned. He was going to spend his days
writing stories and novels and support himself by teaching
in a night school.
Teaching what? As he looked back and evaluated his
college work, he saw that his training in public speaking
had done more to give him confidence, courage, poise
and the ability to meet and deal with people in business
than had all the rest of his college courses put together,
So he urged the Y.M.C.A. schools in New York to give
him a chance to conduct courses in public speaking for
people in business.
What? Make orators out of business people? Absurd.
The Y.M.C.A. people knew. They had tried such courses
-and they had always failed. When they refused to pay
him a salary of two dollars a night, he agreed to teach on
a commission basis and take a percentage of the net profits
-if there were any profits to take. And inside of three
years they were paying him thirty dollars a night on that
basis - instead of two.
The course grew. Other &quot;Ys&quot; heard of it, then other
cities. Dale Carnegie soon became a glorified circuit
rider covering New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and
later London and Paris. All the textbooks were too academic
and impractical for the business people who
flocked to his courses. Because of this he wrote his own
book entitled Public Speaking and Influencing Men in
Business. It became the official text of all the Y.M.C.A.s
as well as of the American Bankers’ Association and the
National Credit Men’s Association.
Dale Carnegie claimed that all people can talk when
they get mad. He said that if you hit the most ignorant
man in town on the jaw and knock him down, he would
get on his feet and talk with an eloquence, heat and
emphasis that would have rivaled that world famous orator
William Jennings Bryan at the height of his career.
He claimed that almost any person can speak acceptably
in public if he or she has self-confidence and an idea
that is boiling and stewing within.
The way to develop self-confidence, he said, is to do
the thing you fear to do and get a record of successful
experiences behind you. So he forced each class member
to talk at every session of the course. The audience
is sympathetic. They are all in the same boat; and, by
constant practice, they develop a courage, confidence
and enthusiasm that carry over into their private speaking.
Dale Carnegie would tell you that he made a living all
these years, not by teaching public speaking - that was
incidental. His main job was to help people conquer
their fears and develop courage.
He started out at first to conduct merely a course in
public speaking, but the students who came were business
men and women. Many of them hadn’t seen the
inside of a classroom in thirty years. Most of them were
paying their tuition on the installment plan. They
wanted results and they wanted them quick - results
that they could use the next day in business interviews
and in speaking before groups.
So he was forced to be swift and practical. Consequently,
he developed a system of training that is
unique - a striking combination of public speaking,
salesmanship, human relations and applied psychology.
A slave to no hard-and-fast rules, he developed a
course that is as real as the measles and twice as much
fun.
When the classes terminated, the graduates formed
clubs of their own and continued to meet fortnightly for
years afterward. One group of nineteen in Philadelphia
met twice a month during the winter season for seventeen
years. Class members frequently travel fifty or a
hundred miles to attend classes. One student used to
commute each week from Chicago to New York.
Professor William James of Harvard used to say that
the average person develops only 10 percent of his latent
mental ability. Dale Carnegie, by helping business men
and women to develop their latent possibilities, created
one of the most significant movements in adult education
