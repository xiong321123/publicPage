Many of my experienced, trusted mentors have died.</p><p>I looked around a few years ago and the wise, (mostly) patient souls who I had peppered with a million questions, who dealt with my late-night phone calls, who helped me start companies and build products and run board meetings or just be a better person—they were gone. Some much too early.</p><p>Now I was the one getting peppered with questions. The same questions I had asked, over and over. Questions about startups, sure, but also more basic stuff: whether to quit a job or not, what career move should I make, how to know if my ideas are any good, how to think about design, how to deal with failure, when and how to start a business.</p><p>And weirdly, I had answers. I had advice. I learned it from amazing mentors and the incredible teams I’ve worked with over thirty years. I learned it at many tiny startups and giant companies, building products that hundreds of millions of people use every day.</p><p>So now, if you call me at midnight, panicked, asking how to keep a company’s culture intact while it’s growing or how not to screw up marketing, I can give you some insights, some tricks and tips, even some rules.</p><p>But I won’t. Please don’t call me at midnight. I’ve learned the value of a good night’s sleep.</p><p>Just read this book.</p><p>It contains much of the advice I give out daily to new grads and CEOs, to execs and interns, to everyone trying to claw their way through the business world and build their career.</p><p>This advice is unorthodox because it’s old-school. The religion of Silicon Valley is reinvention, disruption—blowing up old ways of thinking and proposing new ones. But certain things you can’t blow up. Human nature doesn’t change, regardless of what you’re building, where you live, how old you are, how wealthy or not. And over the last thirty-plus years I’ve seen what humans need to reach their potential, to disrupt what needs disrupting, to forge their own unorthodox path.</p><p>So I’m here to write about a leadership style that I’ve seen win, time and time again. About how my mentors and Steve Jobs did it. About how I do it. About being a troublemaker, a shit-stirrer.</p><p>This isn’t the only way to make something worth making, but it’s my way. And it’s not for everyone. I’m not going to be preaching progressive, modern organizational theory. I’m not going to tell you to work two days a week and retire early.</p><p>The world is full of mediocre, middle-of-the-road companies creating mediocre, middle-of-the-road crap, but I’ve spent my entire life chasing after the products and people that strive for excellence. I’ve been incredibly lucky to learn from the best—from bold, passionate people who made a dent in the world.</p><p>I believe everyone should have that chance.</p><p>That’s why I wrote this book. Everybody trying to do something meaningful needs and deserves to have a mentor and coach—someone who’s seen it and done it and can hopefully help you through the toughest moments in your career. A good mentor won’t hand you the answers, but they will try to help you see your problem from a new perspective. They’ll loan you some of their hard-fought advice so you can discover your own solution.</p><p>And it’s not just tech entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley who deserve some help. This book is for anyone who wants to create something new, who is chasing excellence, who doesn’t want to waste their precious time on this precious planet.</p><p>I’m going to talk a lot about building a great product, but a product doesn’t have to be a piece of technology. It can be anything you make—a service. A store. It could be a new kind of recycling plant. And even if you’re not ready to make anything yet, this advice is still meant for you. Sometimes the first step is just figuring out what you want to do. Getting a job you’re excited about. Building the person you want to become or building a team that you can build anything with.</p><p>This book isn’t trying to be a biography—I’m not dead yet. It’s a mentor in a box. It’s an advice encyclopedia.</p><p>If you’re old enough to remember a time before Wikipedia, you might recall the joy of the literal wall of encyclopedias on your bookshelf or your grandparents’ study or deep inside the bowels of the library. You’d go to it if you had a specific question, but once in a while you’d also just open it up and start reading. A for Aardvark. You’d follow along and see where you ended up, reading straight through or hopping around, discovering little snapshots of the world.</p><p>That’s how you should think of this book.</p><p>You can read it straight through from beginning to end.
You can poke around to find the advice and stories that are most interesting or useful in your current career crisis. Because there’s always a crisis—either personally, organizationally, or competitively.
You can follow the “See also” links sprinkled throughout the book just like you’d click through on Wikipedia. Dig deeper into any topic and see where it takes you.
Most business books have one basic thesis that they spend three hundred pages expanding on. If you’re looking for a range of good advice on various topics, you might need to read forty books, skimming endlessly to find the occasional nugget of useful information. So for this book I just collected the nuggets. Each chapter has advice and stories informed by the jobs, mentors, coaches, managers, and peers I’ve had and the countless mistakes I’ve made.</p><p>Since this is my advice based on my experience, this book roughly follows my career. We go from my first job out of college and end up where I am now. Every step, every failure, taught me something. Life didn’t begin with the iPod.</p><p>But this book isn’t about me. Because I didn’t make anything. I was just one of the people on the teams that made the iPod, iPhone, the Nest Learning Thermostat, and Nest Protect. I was there, but I was never there alone. This book is about what I’ve learned—typically the hard way.</p><p>And to understand the things I’ve learned, you should probably know a bit about me. So here goes:</p><p>1969</p><p>The usual start: I was born. And by preschool, we started moving. My dad was a salesman for Levi’s and we were always on the road, seeking the next denim gold mine. I went to twelve schools in fifteen years.</p><p>1978–1979</p><p>Startup #1: Eggs. I sold them door-to-door in third grade. I stand by that company—it was a solid business. I bought eggs cheap from a farmer, then my little brother and I piled them in our blue wagon and pulled it down the neighborhood streets each morning. It gave me pocket money that my parents couldn’t tell me how to spend—my first taste of true freedom.</p><p>Had I stuck with it, who knows what heights I could have attained.</p><p>1980</p><p>Found my life’s work. It was the summer of fifth grade. A good time to discover your calling. I took a programming class when “programming” meant filling in bubbles with a number 2 pencil on little cards and getting results on a paper printout. There wasn’t even a monitor.</p><p>It was the most magical thing I had ever seen.</p><p>1981</p><p>1st love. An Apple ][+. Eight bits, a real, gorgeous twelve-inch glowing green monitor, a beautiful brown keyboard.</p><p>I had to have that incredible, incredibly expensive machine. My grandfather made me a deal that he’d match whatever money I earned working as a golf caddy, so I worked my ass off until I could afford it.</p><p>I cherished that computer. It was my all-abiding passion and my lifeline. By twelve, I’d given up trying to maintain traditional friendships. I knew I’d just move again the next year, so the only way to hold on to friends was through my Apple. There was no internet, no email, but there were 300-baud modems and digital bulletin boards—BBSes in the parlance of the time. I’d find my fellow geeks in whatever school I was in, then we’d keep in touch through our Apples. We taught ourselves to program and hacked the phone companies to get free long-distance calls and bypass the $1–$2/minute fees.</p><p>1986</p><p>Startup #2: Quality Computers. A friend I connected with over 300-baud started Quality Computers in senior year of high school. I joined him soon after. We were a mail-order company reselling third-party Apple ][ hardware, DRAM chips, and software from his basement. And we wrote our own software, too—the upgrades and expansion boards we sold were complex to install and harder to use, so we wrote software to simplify everything for mere mortals.</p><p>It turned into a real business—an 800 number, warehouses, ads in magazines, employees. A decade later my friend sold it for a couple million. But I was long gone. Selling stuff was okay. Making it was better.</p><p>1989</p><p>Startup #3: ASIC Enterprises. ASIC stood for Applications Specific Integrated Circuit. I didn’t have a ton of branding experience when I was twenty. But I had a lot of love. In the late eighties my beloved Apple ]<!-- -->[ was struggling. It needed to be faster. So a friend and I decided we were going to save Apple. We built a new, faster processor—the 65816. I did not, in fact, know how to build a processor. I took my first processor design class in college a semester after we started. But we built those chips and they worked eight times faster than what was available—a blazing 33MHz—and even sold some to Apple before they stopped designing new Apple ]<!-- -->s.</p><p>1990</p><p>Startup #4: Constructive Instruments. I teamed up with my professor at the University of Michigan to make a multimedia editor for kids. I threw myself into it, was constantly working or on call. I had a beeper in the days when beepers were exclusively for doctors and drug dealers. The other college kids often asked what was wrong with Fadell—why wasn’t he partying and drinking instead of being stuck in a basement, alone with a computer?</p><p>By the time I graduated, Constructive Instruments had a few employees. We had an office. A product. Sales partnerships. I was twenty-one years old and CEO. I was also winging it so hard I’m surprised I didn’t take off.</p><p>1991</p><p>Diagnostics Software Engineer at General Magic. I needed to learn how to run a real startup. So I decided to learn from the greats. I got a job at one of the most secretive, exciting companies in Silicon Valley. It was packed to the rafters with geniuses, the opportunity of a lifetime.</p><p>We were going to make the most amazing personal communications and entertainment device in history. I drank every last drop of the Kool-Aid and poured my life into that company. We were going to change the world. We couldn’t lose.</p><p>1994</p><p>Lead Software and Hardware Engineer at General Magic. We lost.</p><p>1995</p><p>CTO at Philips. I started talking to Philips, one of General Magic’s partners, about what went wrong. I pitched them my idea: we shift the audience, use existing software and hardware, simplify simplify simplify.</p><p>So Philips hired me to make pocket PCs for businesspeople on the go. I became a twenty-five-year-old chief technology officer. It was my second gig out of college.</p><p>1997–1998</p><p>Launched the Philips Velo and Nino. They were a critical success!</p><p>1997–1998</p><p>We couldn’t sell enough.</p><p>1998</p><p>Philips Strategy and Ventures Group. I shifted over to the VC side of Philips. Began learning what I could about that world. But the pocket PC bug was still in my brain. Maybe I just hadn’t gotten the audience right. Maybe we didn’t need to make a PC for businesspeople. Maybe we needed to make a music player for everybody.</p><p>1999</p><p>RealNetworks. I was going to make a digital music player with the right team, the right tech, the right vision.</p><p>1999, six weeks later</p><p>I quit. I stepped through the doors and realized the mistake I’d made almost instantly. Real bad juju.</p><p>1999</p><p>Startup #5: Fuse Systems. Screw it. I’ll do it myself.</p><p>2000</p><p>The dot-com bubble burst. Funding dried up overnight. I did eighty VC pitches. All of them failed. I was desperate to keep my company going.</p><p>2001</p><p>Apple called. At first I was just hoping to make enough money consulting to keep Fuse open. Then I joined Apple and brought my team with me.</p><p>2001, ten months later</p><p>We launched the first iPod. It was a critical success!</p><p>2001–2006</p><p>VP iPod division. After eighteen generations of iPods, we finally got the kinks figured out.</p><p>2007–2010</p><p>SVP iPod division and iPhone. Then we created the iPhone. My team built the hardware and the foundational software to run and manufacture the phone. Then we launched two more versions. Then I quit.</p><p>2010</p><p>Took a break. Focused on my family. Got out of the country. Got exactly as far away from work and Silicon Valley as I needed to be.</p><p>2010</p><p>Startup #6: Nest Labs. Matt Rogers and I started Nest in a garage in Palo Alto. We were going to revolutionize the least sexy product in history: the thermostat. You should have seen people’s faces when we told them what our super-secret new startup was going to build.</p><p>2011</p><p>Launched the Nest Learning Thermostat. It was a critical success! And holy shit. People bought it.</p><p>2013</p><p>Launched the Nest Protect smoke and carbon monoxide alarm. We were beginning to create an ecosystem—a thoughtful home that could take care of itself and the people inside it.</p><p>2014</p><p>Google bought Nest for $3.2 billion. Our hardware, Google’s software and infrastructure: it was going to be an amazing marriage.</p><p>2015–2016</p><p>Google created Alphabet. I quit. Nest got kicked out of Google and into Alphabet, which then demanded we drastically change our plans. Then they decided to sell Nest. Not the marriage we signed up for. I walked away in utter frustration.</p><p>2010–now</p><p>Future Shape. After leaving Google Nest, I focused on some of the advising and investing I’d been doing since 2010. Now we mentor and support around two hundred startups full-time.</p><p>My life has swung wildly between success and failure, incredible career highs immediately followed by bitter disappointment. And with each failure I chose to start from scratch, take all that I’d learned and do something completely new, become someone completely new.</p><p>The latest version of me is a mentor, coach, investor, and, weirdly now, an author. But being an author only happened because the stars aligned when Dina Lovinsky, a brilliant writer who I worked (and sparred) with for a decade, was available to help and ready to call me on my crap. Young, brash, bold, Dina was there from the earliest days of Nest, watched everything happen firsthand, and learned how to write like I would write, if I could write.</p><p>You should probably know now—I’m a terrible writer. I can write software, sure, but write a book? That ain’t me. Armed with only a spreadsheet of random lessons learned, I had no idea how to get the first word on the page. But then again, I also had no idea how to build a computer processor, or a music player, or a smartphone, or a thermostat, and those seem to have worked out okay.</p><p>The advice in this book is by no means complete, but it’s a start. I’m still learning, revising my thoughts each day. Just like everyone else. This book contains some of what I’ve learned so far.</p><p>Part 1
Build Yourself
I tried to build the iPhone twice.</p><p>Everybody knows about the second time. The time we succeeded. Few people know about the first.</p><p>In 1989, an Apple employee and intellectual visionary named Marc Porat drew this:</p><p>image
Fig. 1.0.1</p><p>Marc’s 1989 sketch of the Pocket Crystal in his big red notebook. On the next page he wrote, “This is a very personal object. It must be beautiful. It must offer the kind of personal satisfaction that a fine piece of jewelry brings. It will have a perceived value even when it’s not being used. It should offer the comfort of a touchstone, the tactile satisfaction of a seashell, the enchantment of a crystal.”</p><p>Marc Porat/Spellbound Productions II</p><p>The Pocket Crystal was a beautiful touchscreen mobile computer that combined a cell phone and fax machine, that let you play games and watch movies and buy plane tickets from anywhere.</p><p>This insanely prophetic vision was made more completely nuts by the fact that this was—I repeat—1989. The Web didn’t exist, mobile gaming meant carrying a Nintendo console to your friend’s house, and almost nobody owned—or even really understood the need for—a cell phone. There were pay phones everywhere, everyone’s got a pager—why lug around a giant plastic brick with you?</p><p>But Marc and two other geniuses and ex-Apple wizards, Bill Atkinson and Andy Hertzfeld, started a company to build the future. They called it General Magic.* I read about it in the “Mac The Knife” rumors section of (the now long-dead) MacWeek Magazine right around the time I realized that I had no real idea how to run my startup.</p><p>I’d started a few computer-related companies in high school and college, but I’d been focused on Constructive Instruments since my junior year at the University of Michigan. I founded it with one of my professors—the cherubic, “oy vey”-ing Elliot Soloway. Elliot was dedicated to educational technology and together we built a multimedia editor for kids. And we got pretty far—a product, employees, an office. But I was still going to the library to look up the difference between an S-corporation and a C. I was green, green, green. And I had no one to ask—there were no entrepreneurial meetups back then, no Y Combinators. Google wouldn’t exist for seven years.</p><p>General Magic was my chance to learn everything I could possibly want to know. To work with my heroes—the geniuses who made the Apple ][, the Lisa, the Macintosh. It was my first real job and my first real chance to change the world like Andy and Bill had.</p><p>When I talk to people fresh out of college or early in their careers, that’s what they’re looking for. An opportunity to make an impact and set themselves on a path to make something great.</p><p>But all the stuff they don’t and can’t teach you in college—how to thrive in the workplace, how to create something amazing, how to deal with managers and eventually become one—it all slaps you in the face the second you step off campus. No matter how much you learn in school, you still need to get the equivalent of a PhD in navigating the rest of the world and building something meaningful. You have to try and fail and learn by doing.</p><p>And that means pretty much every young graduate, entrepreneur, and dreamer asks me the same questions:</p><p>“What kind of job should I try to get?”</p><p>“What kinds of companies should I work for?”</p><p>“How do I build a network?”</p><p>There’s often an assumption that if you find the right job when you’re young, you can guarantee some level of success. That your first job out of college connects in a straight line to your second and your third, that at each stage of your career you’ll use your inevitable wins to propel yourself upward.</p><p>That’s what I thought too. I was 100 percent sure General Magic was going to make one of the most impactful devices in history. I poured everything into it. We all did. The team worked literally nonstop for years—we even gave out awards for sleeping in the office for consecutive nights.</p><p>Then General Magic imploded. After years of work, tens of millions invested, newspapers shouting that we were destined to beat Microsoft, we sold three to four thousand devices. Maybe five thousand. And that was mostly to family and friends.</p><p>The company failed. I failed.</p><p>And I spent the next ten years getting kicked in the stomach by Silicon Valley before I made something people actually wanted.</p><p>In the process I learned a lot of hard, painful, wonderful, stupid, useful lessons. So for anyone starting their career, or starting a new career, here’s what you need to know.</p><p>Chapter 1.1
Adulthood
Adulthood is commonly thought of as the time when learning is over and living begins. Yes! I’ve graduated! I’m done! But learning never ends. School has not prepared you to be successful for the rest of your life. Adulthood is your opportunity to screw up continually until you learn how to screw up a little bit less.</p><p>Traditional schooling trains people to think incorrectly about failure. You’re taught a subject, you take a test, and if you fail, that’s it. You’re done. But once you’re out of school, there is no book, no test, no grade. And if you fail, you learn. In fact, in most cases, it’s the only way to learn—especially if you’re creating something the world has never seen before.</p><p>So when you’re looking at the array of potential careers before you, the correct place to start is this: “What do I want to learn?”</p><p>Not “How much money do I want to make?”</p><p>Not “What title do I want to have?”</p><p>Not “What company has enough name recognition that my mom can brutally crush the other moms when they boast about their kids?”</p><p>The best way to find a job you’ll love and a career that will eventually make you successful is to follow what you’re naturally interested in, then take risks when choosing where to work. Follow your curiosity rather than a business school playbook about how to make money. Assume that for much of your twenties your choices will not work out and the companies you join or start will likely fail. Early adulthood is about watching your dreams go up in flames and learning as much as you can from the ashes. Do, fail, learn. The rest will follow.</p><hr><p>I arrived in a cheap, ill-fitting midwestern suit for my interview at General Magic. Everyone was sitting on the floor. They looked up at me, utterly bewildered. Their faces read, “Who is this kid?” They told me to sit down and take off my tie and jacket for Christ’s sake.</p><p>Mistake #1.</p><p>Luckily it was a small one. I became employee #29 in 1991. I was a kid, twenty-one years old, and I gratefully took a job as a diagnostics software engineer. I was going to build software and hardware tools to check other people’s designs—the lowest person on the totem pole. But I didn’t care. I knew I just needed to get in the door to prove myself and move up.</p><p>A month before that, I’d been CEO of my own company. We were tiny—a startup of three, sometimes four people—and were inching along. But it felt more like treading water. And treading water felt like drowning. Either you’re growing or you’re done. There is no stasis.</p><p>So I went where I could grow. The title and the money weren’t important. The people were. The mission was. The opportunity was all that mattered.</p><p>I remember packing up my stuff to drive to California from Michigan, my belly full of butterflies, four hundred dollars to my name, and my parents trying to understand what the hell was going on.</p><p>They wanted me to succeed. They wanted me to be happy. But I truly seemed to be screwing everything up and had been for years. I loved computers, but I’d gotten thrown out of my first computer class in seventh grade nearly every day. I was always telling the teacher he was wrong, always insisting I knew better, never shutting up. I made the poor man cry until they dragged me out of that class and made me learn French instead.</p><p>Then I skipped my very first week of college at the University of Michigan to go to Apple Fest in San Francisco and work a booth for my startup. I told my parents after I landed back in Detroit. They were beside themselves. But I’d learned early on to ask for forgiveness, not permission. And I remember the revelation of sitting in my dorm, still digesting the dinner I’d eaten at the wharf in San Francisco, realizing I could be part of two worlds at once. That it wasn’t even that hard.</p><p>And now I was quitting the company that I had founded, that I had worked day and night to build, that had always seemed like an incredible risk but which was just starting to pay off. And I was going to go—where? General Magic? What the hell was General Magic? If I was going to get a regular job, why not at IBM? Why not Apple? Why not do something stable? Why couldn’t I choose a path they could understand?</p><p>I wish I’d known this quote then—maybe it would have helped:</p><p>“The only failure in your twenties is inaction. The rest is trial and error.”</p><p>—ANONYMOUS</p><p>I needed to learn. And the best way to do that was to surround myself with people who knew exactly how hard it was to make something great—who had the scars to prove it. And if it turned out to be the wrong move, well, making a mistake is the best way to not make that mistake again. Do, fail, learn.</p><p>The critical thing is to have a goal. To strive for something big and hard and important to you. Then every step you take toward that goal, even if it’s a stumble, moves you forward.</p><p>And you can’t skip a step—you can’t just have the answers handed to you and detour around the hard stuff. Humans learn through productive struggle, by trying it themselves and screwing up and doing it differently next time. In early adulthood you have to learn to embrace that—to know that the risks might not pan out but to take them anyway. You can get guidance and advice, you can choose a path by following someone else’s example, but you won’t really learn until you start walking down that path yourself and seeing where it takes you.</p><p>I give a speech at high schools sometimes—at graduations where a bunch of eighteen-year-old kids are heading out into the world, alone, for the first time.</p><p>I tell them that they probably make 25 percent of their decisions. If that.</p><p>From the moment you’re born until you move out of your parents’ house, almost all your choices are made, shaped, or influenced by your parents.</p><p>And I’m not just talking about the obvious decisions—which classes to take, which sports to play. I mean the millions of hidden decisions you’ll discover when you leave home and start doing things for yourself:</p><p>What type of toothpaste do you use?</p><p>What kind of toilet paper?</p><p>Where do you put the silverware?</p><p>How do you arrange your clothes?</p><p>What religion do you follow?</p><p>All these subtle things that you never made a decision about growing up are already implanted in your brain.</p><p>Most kids don’t consciously examine any of these choices. They mimic their parents. And when you’re a kid, that’s usually fine. It’s necessary.</p><p>But you’re not a kid anymore.</p><p>And after you move out of your parents’ house, there’s a window—a brief, shining, incredible window—where your decisions are yours alone. You’re not beholden to anyone—not a spouse, not kids, not parents. You’re free. Free to choose whatever you’d like.</p><p>That is the time to be bold.</p><p>Where are you going to live?</p><p>Where are you going to work?</p><p>Who are you going to be?</p><p>Your parents will always have suggestions for you—feel free to take them or ignore them. Their judgment is colored by what they want for you (the best, of course, only the best). You’ll need to find other people—other mentors—to give you useful advice. A teacher or cousin or an aunt or the older kid of a close family friend. Just because you’re on your own doesn’t mean you have to be alone with your decisions.</p><p>Because this is it. This is your window. This is your time to take risks.</p><p>When you’re in your thirties and forties, the window begins to close for most people. Your decisions can no longer be entirely your own. That’s okay, too—great even—but it’s different. The people who depend on you will shape and influence your choices. Even if you don’t have a family to support, you’ll still accumulate just a little more each year—friends, assets, social standing—that you won’t want to risk.</p><p>But when you’re early in your career—and early in your life—the worst that can happen if you take big risks is probably moving back with your parents. And that is not shameful. Throwing yourself out there and having everything blow up in your face is the world’s best way to learn fast and figure out what you want to do next.</p><p>You might screw up. Your company might fail. You might have so many butterflies in your stomach you’ll be worried you got food poisoning. And that’s okay. It’s exactly what should be happening. If you don’t feel those butterflies then you’re not doing it right. You have to push yourself up the mountain, even if it means you might fall off a cliff.</p><p>I learned more from my first colossal failure than I ever did from my first success.</p><p>General Magic was an experiment. Not just in what we were making—and we were making something wholly, ridiculously, almost unbelievably new—but also in how to structure a company. The team was so impressive, packed with genius after genius, that there was no regard for “management.” No defined process. We just kind of . . . made stuff. Whatever our leaders thought would be cool.</p><p>And every piece had to be hand-built, from scratch. It was like giving one hundred artisans a pile of sheet metal, plastic, and glass and telling them to build a car. One of my projects was to figure out how to connect various gadgets into our device, so I built the precursor to the USB port. Then I was assigned to build an infrared network to work between devices (like how a remote connects to a TV)—so I reinvented all seven layers of a protocol stack. Amazingly, I made it work. The other engineers were excited and created a word game on top of it. The game became a hit around the office. I was ecstatic, over the moon. But eventually a more experienced engineer got around to looking at what I’d coded and, baffled, asked why I’d built a network protocol that way. I answered that I didn’t know I was building a network protocol.</p><p>Mistake #2.</p><p>But even though I could have just read a book and saved myself days of work—man, did it feel good. I’d made something the world had never seen before, something useful, and I made it my way.</p><p>It was crazy. But it was fun. Especially in the beginning when everybody was focused on fun. There was no dress code. No rules for the office. It was so different from what I was used to in the Midwest. General Magic was probably one of the first Silicon Valley companies that truly embodied the idea that playing at work was worthwhile—that a joyful workplace could make a joyful product.</p><p>And we probably took the joy a little far. Once we were in the office in the middle of the night, working late as usual, and I grabbed the three-person slingshot (doesn’t everyone have a slingshot in their office?). Two accomplices and I loaded it with slime, fired, and punched a giant hole through a large third-story window. I was terrified I’d get fired.</p><p>Everyone just laughed.</p><p>That was Mistake #3.</p><p>For four years, I threw myself into General Magic. I learned and screwed up and worked and worked and worked. Ninety, 100, 120 hours a week. I never liked coffee, so I survived primarily off Diet Coke. A dozen a day (for the record, I haven’t touched the poison since).</p><p>(I don’t recommend working that much, by the way. You should never kill yourself for your job, and no job should ever expect that of you. But if you want to prove yourself, to learn as much as you can and do as much as you can, you need to put in the time. Stay late. Come in early. Work over the weekend and holidays sometimes. Don’t expect a vacation every couple of months. Let the scales tip a little on your work/life balance—let your passion for what you’re building drive you.)</p><p>For years I ran full tilt in whatever direction people pointed me in—and we were going in every direction at once. My heroes would say take that hill, and by God, I would make it my Everest and do whatever it took to impress them. I was 100 percent sure we were going to make the most world-changing device in history. We all were.</p><p>Then the launch got delayed. Again. And again. And again. We had no shortage of money or press or all the sky-high expectations to go with it, so the product just kept growing. Never quite good enough or done enough. Our competitors started popping out of the woodwork. We were creating a private network system run by major telecom companies like AT&amp;T just as the internet began to go mainstream, open to everyone. Our processor didn’t have enough oomph to support the ambitious user experience (UX) that Andy and Bill dreamed up nor the graphics and icons that Susan Kare designed. Susan is a brilliant artist who created the original visual language for the Mac, and she made an entire beautiful world for the Magic Link. But then every time you tapped on the screen, the damn thing would freeze. User testers were frustrated by the waiting, the bugs, never knowing if they’d done something wrong or the device had just stopped working. The list of issues would get longer each day.</p><p>Mistake #4 through mistake #4000.</p><p>When we finally shipped in 1994, we hadn’t made the Pocket Crystal. We made the Sony Magic Link.</p><p>image
Fig. 1.1.1</p><p>The Magic Link retailed for $800, weighed almost 1.5 pounds, and was a hefty 7.7 x 5.6 inches. It had a phone, a touchscreen, email, downloadable apps, games, a way to buy plane tickets, animated emojis, and revolutionary technology woven throughout. Kind of like the iPhone.</p><p>Dwight Eschliman</p><p>It was deeply flawed and strangely suspended between the past and the future—it had both animated emojis and a little printer for faxes. But it was still absolutely, flat-out, ahead-of-its-time amazing. A first step into a different world, where everyone could carry a computer anywhere. All the work, the lack of sleep, the toll on my body, the toll on my parents—it was going to be worth it. I was incredibly proud of it. I was so thrilled with what our team had created. I still am.</p><p>And then nobody bought it.</p><p>After spending all those days and nights in the office, I woke up and couldn’t get out of bed. I felt it in my chest. Everything we had done ended in failure. Everything.</p><p>And I ultimately knew why.</p><p>By the time General Magic was unraveling around me, I wasn’t just a lowly diagnostics engineer anymore. I’d worked on silicon, hardware, and software architecture and design. When things started to go awry, I’d ventured out and started talking to people in sales and marketing, began learning about psychographics and branding, finally grasped the importance of managers, of process, of limits. After four years, I realized there was a whole world of thinking that was needed before a line of code should be written. And that thinking was fascinating. That thinking was what I wanted to do.</p><p>The enormous gut punch of our failure, of my failure, of everything I’d worked for falling apart—it made the path in front of me strangely clear: General Magic was making incredible technology but wasn’t making a product that would solve real people’s problems. But I thought I could.</p><p>That’s what you’re looking for when you’re young, when you think you know everything then suddenly realize you have no idea what you’re doing: a place where you can work as hard as you can to learn as much as you can from people who can make something great. So even if the experience kicks your ass, the force of that kick will propel you into a new stage of your life. And you’ll figure out what to do next.</p><p>Chapter 1.2
Get a Job
If you’re going to throw your time, energy, and youth at a company, try to join one that’s not just making a better mousetrap. Find a business that’s starting a revolution. A company that’s likely to make a substantial change in the status quo has the following characteristics:</p><p>It’s creating a product or service that’s wholly new or combines existing technology in a novel way that the competition can’t make or even understand.
This product solves a problem—a real pain point—that a lot of customers experience daily. There should be an existing large market.
The novel technology can deliver on the company vision—not just within the product but also the infrastructure, platforms, and systems that support it.
Leadership is not dogmatic about what the solution looks like and is willing to adapt to their customers’ needs.
It’s thinking about a problem or a customer need in a way you’ve never heard before, but which makes perfect sense once you hear it.</p><hr><p>Cool technology isn’t enough. A great team isn’t enough. Plenty of funding isn’t enough. Too many people throw themselves blindly at hot trends, anticipating a gold rush, and end up falling off a cliff. Look at the body count of virtual reality (VR)—dead startups as far as the eye can see and billions of dollars burned up over the past thirty years.</p><p>“If you make it, they will come” doesn’t always work. If the technology isn’t ready, they won’t come for sure. But even if you’ve got the tech, then you still have to time it right. The world has to be ready to want it. Customers need to see that your product solves a real problem they have today—not one that they may have in some distant future.</p><p>I think of this as the General Magic problem. We were trying to build an iPhone years before it was a glimmer in Steve Jobs’s eye.</p><p>And you know what utterly beat us? Palm. Because Palm PDAs let you put the phone numbers you kept on scraps of paper or on your desktop computer into a device that you could carry with you. That’s it. That simple. You couldn’t jam a Rolodex into your pocket or purse, so Palm was the right solution for the time. It made sense. It had a reason to exist.</p><p>General Magic did not. We started from the technology—focusing on what we could create, what would impress the geniuses at our company—not the reason why real, nontechnical people would need it. So the Magic Link solved problems that regular people wouldn’t recognize for more than a decade. And because nobody else was building technology for nonexistent problems, the networks, processors, and input mechanisms our products depended on weren’t good enough. We had to make everything ourselves. Magic CAP, a revolutionary object-oriented operating system. TeleScript, a new client server programming language. We created servers with online applications and stores. And ultimately, even though it fell short of the vision, we built something really incredible. For us geeks.</p><p>For everyone else, it was kind of neat. Maybe. If they even understood what it was. A luxury toy for rich people or nerds or very rich nerds. A plaything.</p><p>If you’re not solving a real problem, you can’t start a revolution.</p><p>A glaring example is Google Glass or Magic Leap—all the money and PR in the world can’t change the fact that augmented reality (AR) glasses are a technology in search of a problem to solve. There’s just no reason for the general public to buy them. Not yet. Nobody can quite imagine walking into a party or the office with these weird ugly glasses on their face, creepily filming everyone around them. And even if there’s a brilliant vision for the future of AR glasses, the technology can’t deliver it yet and the social stigma will take a long time to dissolve. I’m convinced it’ll happen, but they’re still years away.</p><p>On the other hand, take Uber. The founders started with a customer problem—a problem they experienced in their daily lives—then applied technology. The problem was simple: finding a cab in Paris was next to impossible and hiring private drivers was expensive and took forever. In the days before smartphones, the solution might have been to simply start a new kind of taxi or limo business. But the company’s timing was perfect—the sudden ubiquity of smartphones provided Uber with a platform and put customers into the right mindset to accept their solution. If I can order a toaster with an app on my phone, why shouldn’t I hail a car? That combination of a real problem, the right timing, and innovative technology allowed Uber to shift the paradigm—to create something that traditional cab companies couldn’t even dream of, never mind compete with.</p><p>And this isn’t just a Silicon Valley phenomenon. Revolutionary companies are popping up in every industry—in agriculture, drug discovery and creation, finance and insurance—in every part of the world. Seemingly impossible problems that a decade ago would have cost billions to solve, requiring massive investments from giant firms, can now be figured out with a smartphone app, a small sensor, and the internet. And that means there are thousands of people all over the world finding opportunities to change the way people work and live and think.</p><p>Take whatever job you can at one of those companies. Don’t worry too much about the title—focus on the work. If you get a foot in the door at a growing company, you’ll find opportunities to grow, too.</p><p>Just whatever you do, don’t become a “management consultant” at a behemoth like McKinsey or Bain or one of the other eight consultancies that dominate the industry. They all have thousands upon thousands of employees and work almost exclusively with Fortune 5000 companies. These corporations, typically led by tentative, risk-averse CEOs, call in the management consultants to do a massive audit, find the flaws, and present leadership with a new plan that will magically “fix” everything. What a fairy tale—don’t get me started.</p><p>But to many new grads, it sounds perfect: you get paid incredibly well to travel around the world, work with powerful companies and executives, and learn exactly how to make a business successful. It’s an alluring promise.</p><p>Parts of it are even true. Yes, you get a nice paycheck. And yes, you get plenty of practice pitching important clients. But you don’t learn how to build or run a company. Not really.</p><p>Steve Jobs once said of management consulting, “You do get a broad cut at companies but it’s very thin. It’s like a picture of a banana: you might get a very accurate picture but it’s only two dimensions, and without the experience of actually doing it you never get three dimensional. So you might have a lot of pictures on your walls, you can show it off to your friends—I’ve worked in bananas, I’ve worked in peaches, I’ve worked in grapes—but you never really taste it.”</p><p>If you do choose to go that route and find yourself at one of the Big Four or the other top six firms, then that is of course your choice. Just know before you go what you want to learn and the experiences you need for your next chapter. Don’t get stuck. Management consulting should never be your endpoint—it should be a way station, a brief pause on your journey to actually doing something. Making something.</p><p>To do great things, to really learn, you can’t shout suggestions from the rooftop then move on while someone else does the work. You have to get your hands dirty. You have to care about every step, lovingly craft every detail. You have to be there when it falls apart so you can put it back together.</p><p>You have to actually do the job. You have to love the job.</p><p>But what happens if you fall in love with the wrong thing? If you find a product or company that’s too early—the supporting infrastructure isn’t there, the customers don’t exist, the leadership has a crazy vision and won’t budge.</p><p>What if you’re deeply passionate about quantum computing or synthetic biology or fusion energy or space exploration even though there’s no sign that any of those industries will bear fruit anytime soon?</p><p>Then screw it. Go for it. If you love it, don’t worry about all my advice, don’t worry about the timing.</p><p>I spent the dot-com bubble building handheld devices. After General Magic started floundering, the obvious solution was to jump ship to Yahoo or eBay and join the internet gold rush. That’s what everyone told me to do. “Are you crazy, why go to Philips?! The internet is where all the money is! No one needs more consumer computing devices.”</p><p>But I went to Philips anyway. I knew there was room for something amazing between desktop computers and cell phones. I saw it, felt it, when I was at General Magic. So I built a team to make devices at Philips and then started my own company to make digital music players. I stuck with it because I loved it—loved building the whole system from the bottom up, the atoms and electrons, the hardware and software and networks and design. And by the time Apple called me to make the iPod, I knew exactly how to do it.</p><p>If you’re passionate about something—something that could be solving a huge problem one day—then stick with it.</p><p>Look around and find the community of people who are passionate about it, too. If there’s nobody else on Earth thinking about it, then you may truly be too early or going in the wrong direction. But if you can find even a handful of like-minded people, even if it’s just a tiny community of geeks building technology nobody has any idea how to turn into a real business, then keep going. Get in on the ground floor, make friends, and find mentors and connections that will bear fruit when the world spins just enough to make what you’re making make sense. You may not be at the same company as when you started, the vision may be different, the product may be different, and the technology will have changed. You may have to fail and fail and learn and learn and evolve and understand and grow.</p><p>But one day, if you are truly solving a real problem, when the world is ready to want it, you’ll already be there.</p><p>What you do matters. Where you work matters. Most importantly, who you work with and learn from matters. Too many people see work as a means to an end, as a way to make enough money to stop working. But getting a job is your opportunity to make a dent in the world. To put your focus and energy and your precious, precious time toward something meaningful. You don’t have to be an executive right away, you don’t have to get a job at the most amazing, world-changing company right out of college, but you should have a goal. You should know where you want to go, who you want to work with, what you want to learn, who you want to become. And from there, hopefully you’ll start to understand how to build what you want to build.</p><p>Chapter 1.3
Heroes
Students seek out the best professors on the best projects when getting their master’s or PhD, but when they look for jobs, they focus on money, perks, and titles. However, the only thing that can make a job truly amazing or a complete waste of time is the people. Focus on understanding your field and use that knowledge to create connections with the best of the best, people you truly respect. Your heroes. Those (typically humble) rock stars will lead you to the career you want.</p><hr><p>If there are gods of software design and coding, they are Bill Atkinson and Andy Hertzfeld. Their faces were in the magazines I’d read religiously cover to cover since grade school. I’d used everything they’d ever built—the revolutionary Mac, MacPaint, Hypercard, the Lisa.</p><p>They were my heroes. When I met them, I felt like I was meeting the president. The Beatles. Led Zeppelin. My palms were sweating when I shook their hands; I could barely catch my breath. But after time passed and I blinked the stars out of my eyes, I realized they were approachable, easy to talk to—a rare trait in the world of geniuses. And I could talk to them for hours. About coding, about design and UX, about a million things I was curious about. I even showed them the product my startup Constructive Instruments had created.</p><p>That’s the main reason I got the job at General Magic, I think, even though there were people sleeping on their doorstep to get an interview and I was a nobody geek from Michigan. Not because I could flatter the founders or because I hounded the very patient and ever-helpful HR director, Dee Gardetti, before and after the interview (although in that pre-email era I did call her every day for a month—before and after the interview), but because I had gained a huge amount of practical, useful information through sheer brute force. I spent most of my time building—chips and software and devices and companies—and the rest of my time reading everything I could get my hands on about the industry. And that’s what set me apart. That’s what can set anyone apart. Bill Gurley, the incredibly smart, wry, contrarian Silicon Valley VC and Texan deal maker, puts it this way: “I can’t make you the smartest or the brightest, but it’s doable to be the most knowledgeable. It’s possible to gather more information than somebody else.”</p><p>And if you’re going to devote that much time to gathering information, then learn about something you’d be interested in even if you weren’t trying to get a job doing it. Follow your curiosity. Once you’re armed with that knowledge, then you can start hunting down the people who are the best of the best and trying to work with them. And that doesn’t mean stalking Elon Musk if you’re into electric cars. Look at who reports to him. And who reports to them. And which competing company would kill to hire those people. Understand the subdisciplines and see who leads the one you’re most interested in. Find the experts on Twitter or YouTube, then send them a message, a comment, a LinkedIn connection. You’re interested in the same things, you have the same passions—so share your point of view, ask a smart question, or just tell them about some fascinating minutiae that your family and friends find deeply, desperately, unfathomably boring.</p><p>Make a connection. That’s the best way to get a job anywhere.</p><p>And if that seems impossible—if you follow your heroes on Twitter but can’t imagine they’ll ever pay any attention to you—I’m excited to tell you that that is complete bullshit. I doubt I’m anyone’s hero, but I’m an experienced, well-connected product designer who’s been lucky enough to make some famous technology. Most people assume I won’t pay any attention to people who randomly DM me on Twitter or send me unsolicited emails out of the blue. But sometimes I do.</p><p>Not when people are just asking for a job. Or angling for funding. But I’ll notice people who come with something interesting to share. Something smart. Especially if they keep coming. If they sent me something cool last week and something cool this week and they keep bringing fascinating news or tech or ideas and they’re persistent, then I’ll start to recognize them. I’ll start to remember them, and respond. And that can turn into an introduction or a friendship or a referral or, potentially, a job at one of our portfolio companies.</p><p>The key is persistence and being helpful. Not just asking for something, but offering something. You always have something to offer if you’re curious and engaged. You can always trade and barter good ideas; you can always be kind and find a way to help.</p><p>Look at Harry Stebbings. He’s a smart, genuine, incredibly nice person who started the 20 Minute VC podcast in 2015. Then he just started inviting people to be on it. He put himself out there. He was persistent. He was helpful and warm. And he started getting some traction—first one CEO, then another, founders and investors and high-level execs. Including me—it was one of my favorite podcast interviews.</p><p>After every podcast, he asks his interviewee in private, “Who are the top three people you know and respect who you think I should talk to next? Do you mind intro-ing me really quickly?”</p><p>In 2020, he was able to parlay his success and network into a small VC fund. In 2021, that fund got an additional $140 million in funding.</p><p>As I write this, Harry Stebbings is twenty-four years old.</p><p>And I’m not saying that every tweet or LinkedIn message to your heroes is going to turn into a $140 million VC fund. But it might turn into a job. It might even turn into a job with your heroes.</p><p>And any job working with your heroes is a good job.</p><p>But if you can, try to get into a small company. The sweet spot is a business of 30–100 people building something worth building, with a few rock stars you can learn from even if you aren’t working with them every day.</p><p>You could go to Google, Apple, Facebook, or some other giant company, but it’ll be hard to maneuver yourself to work closely with the rock stars. And you should know you’re not going to make a real impact. Not for a long time. You’re a pebble bouncing off an elephant. But you’ll be a well-paid pebble eating free kale chips, so if you do go that route enjoy the paycheck while working on your tiny piece of some vast and endless project. Then spend your ample free time getting a feel for the structures and divisions, the micro-disciplines, the processes, the research, the long-term projects and long-term thinking a company can do when shipping tomorrow isn’t critical to its survival. That stuff is good to know. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 4.2: Are You Ready?]<!-- --> But don’t get stuck between the elephant’s toes so you can never see the whole beast. It’s easy to mistake navigating processes, red tape, job leveling, and politics for real personal growth.</p><p>A small company has fewer resources, less equipment, tiny budgets. It may not be a success and may never make any money. It may not have many perks (although that could be a good thing). Startups that blow all their funding on Ping-Pong instructors and free beer aren’t focused on the right things. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 6.4: Fuck Massages.]<!-- --> But you’ll work with a wider range of talented people—in sales, marketing, product, operations, legal, maybe even quality or customer support. Smaller companies still have specialization, but usually without silos. And they have a different energy. The whole company will be focused on working together to make one precious idea become reality. Anything unnecessary is shunned; red tape and politics are typically nonexistent. There’s more riding on what you do because it’s actually meaningful to the company surviving. You’re all in the lifeboat together.</p><p>And being in that lifeboat with people you deeply respect is a joy. It is the best time you can have at work. It might be the best time you can have, period. And it doesn’t have to end once you’re on dry land.</p><p>Among the many amazing people who I got to work with at General Magic were Wendell and Brian Sander. Father and son, both insanely brilliant, salt of the earth, engineer’s engineers. Brian was my manager at General Magic and both the Sanders helped me figure out how to create MagicBus, a digital peripheral bus for the Magic Link. The ideas and patents we created together are now the basis for USB devices around the world. It was a dream come true.</p><p>When General Magic imploded, we all went our separate ways. But I never lost touch. And ten years later, I hired Brian to work on the iPod with me. And then Brian hired his dad.</p><p>Once Wendell and I were walking into Apple’s main building, Infinite Loop 1, and we bumped into Steve Jobs. Steve was thrilled. Wendell had been Apple employee #16 but Steve hadn’t seen him in years. “Wendell! Where you at these days?”</p><p>And Wendell said, “I’m here. Working on the iPod. With Fadell.”</p><p>When you get a chance to work with legends and heroes and gods, you realize they’re none of the things that you’ve fabricated in your brain. They can be geniuses in one area and clueless in another. They can raise you up by praising your work, but you can also help them, catch things they miss, and build a relationship based not on starry-eyed hero worship but mutual respect.</p><p>And let me tell you, there is nothing in the world that feels better than helping your hero in a meaningful way and earning their trust—watching them realize you know what you’re talking about, that you can be relied on, that you’re someone to remember. And then seeing how that respect evolves as you move on to the next job, and the next.</p><p>That’s the great thing about heroes. You can use their inspiration to drive you. If you do it right, and listen carefully, they’ll share decades of learning. And then, one day, you might return the favor.</p><p>Chapter 1.4
Don’t (Only) Look Down
The job of an individual contributor (IC)—a person who doesn’t manage others—is usually to craft something that needs to be completed that day or in the next week or two. Their responsibility is to sweat the details, so most individual contributors depend on their managers and executive team to set a destination and lay out a path for them so they can keep their focus on the work.</p><p>However, if an IC is constantly looking down, their eyes exclusively on their own tight deadlines and the minutiae of their job, they may walk directly into a brick wall.</p><p>As an IC, you need to occasionally do two things:</p><ol><li><p>Look up: Look beyond the next deadline or project and forward to all the milestones coming up in the next few months. Then look all the way down to your ultimate goal: the mission. Ideally it should be the reason you joined the project in the first place. As your project progresses, be sure the mission still makes sense to you and that the path to reach it seems achievable.</p></li><li><p>Look around: Get out of your comfort zone and away from the immediate team you’re on. Talk to the other functions in your company to understand their perspectives, needs, and concerns. This internal networking is always useful and it can give you an early warning if your project is not headed in the right direction.</p></li></ol><hr><p>I only looked up when the sky was falling. Really falling. Before that, an occasional asteroid would rocket through my cubicle at General Magic—when the parts for a good touchscreen hadn’t been invented yet, or the software I just wrote “broke the build,” or the mobile networks we needed barely functioned—but I’d just brush off my keyboard and keep going.</p><p>I trusted Bill, Andy, and Marc to steer the ship. All that was required of me was to prove myself. That’s the one downside of working with your heroes. You’re so busy learning your craft from them that you just assume they’re looking at the big picture. You assume they’ll notice the brick wall directly in their path.</p><p>Think of a project as a straight line in time—there’s a beginning and (hopefully) an end. Everyone is walking at the same pace, day by day, on parallel lines—a line for engineering, marketing, sales, PR, customer support, manufacturing, legal, etc.</p><p>image
Fig. 1.4.1</p><p>The details of the project right in front of you are crystal clear, but the farther you look out, the fuzzier everything becomes. And different teammates are gazing at different points on that timeline.</p><p>Matteo Vianello</p><p>The CEO and executive team are mostly staring way out on the horizon—50 percent of their time is spent planning for a fuzzy, distant future months or years away, 25 percent is focused on upcoming milestones in the next month or two, and the last 25 percent is spent putting out fires happening right now at their feet. They also look at all the parallel lines to make sure everyone is keeping up and going in the same direction.</p><p>Managers usually keep their eyes focused 2–6 weeks out. Those projects are pretty fleshed out and detailed, though they still have some fuzzy bits around the edges. Managers’ heads should be on a swivel—they often look down, sometimes look further out, and spend a fair amount of time looking side to side, checking in on other teams, making sure everything’s coming together for the next milestone.</p><p>Junior individual contributors spend 80 percent of their time looking straight down—maybe a week or two out—to see the fine points of their day-to-day work. In the early stages of your career, that’s the way it should be. You should be focused on getting your specific piece of each project done, done well, and out the door.</p><p>Your executive team and managers are supposed to be looking out for roadblocks. They’re supposed to warn you so you can adjust course, or at least grab a helmet.</p><p>But sometimes they don’t.</p><p>So 20 percent of the time, individual contributors need to look up. And they need to look around. The sooner they start, the faster and higher they’ll advance in their career.</p><p>Your job isn’t just doing your job. It’s also to think like your manager or CEO. You need to understand the ultimate goal, even if it’s so far away that you’re not really sure what it’ll look like when you get there. That’s helpful in your day-to-day—knowing your destination lets you self-prioritize and make decisions about what you’re doing and how you’re doing it. But it’s also bigger than that. You want to make sure the direction you’re headed in still feels right—that you still believe in it.</p><p>And you can’t ignore the other teams who are working by your side.</p><p>image
Fig. 1.4.2</p><p>When you look up and around, you can see if your medium- and long-term goals still make sense, and understand the needs and concerns of the teams around you. Talk to your internal customers, whoever you’re a customer of, and the people who are closest to the actual customer—marketing and support. That’s how you’ll know if you’re on track or if things are going seriously sideways.</p><p>Matteo Vianello</p><p>The first time an asteroid hit me squarely in the face was when I was having lunch with Tracy Beiers. Tracy’s a true prankster, an original. As a product manager and an experienced marketer from Microsoft, she’d seen it all when she was working on Windows 1.0.</p><p>“I don’t know why anyone needs the lemon,” she said. She was talking about a little animated emoji we’d just added. It would walk across your emails, doing things even modern emojis can’t dream of. Ah, I thought. She wasn’t an engineer. She didn’t get it. So I rushed to explain: it was so innovative! Here’s how we made it! So cool, right? Didn’t she think so?</p><p>“Yeah, it’s cute, I guess,” she said, and shrugged. “But I just want email that works. I don’t care about the lemon. Nobody’s going to care about the damn walking lemon.”</p><p>Huh. Everyone on the engineering team loved it. So I said, “Tell me more.”</p><p>I had never approached the product from her point of view. She forced me to take off my engineering, techno-savvy rose-colored glasses and look at what we were building from the perspective of a regular human being.</p><p>It was a hard conversation—I was puzzled, dumbfounded. But it was also incredibly useful for both of us. I wanted to understand her perspective. She wanted to understand my side of the business. Mostly, she wanted to know what the hell I was doing.</p><p>Not only was she worried that the features we were building were charming but useless, she was also worried we wouldn’t actually build them.</p><p>“We just worked with Sony marketing to make an ad campaign saying the Magic Link will be able to do all these things. Is it true? Can we actually deliver?”</p><p>This was probably around the fifth time we’d pushed back our launch date. Many of the features we’d promised investors and partners had fallen through. The product was slow and buggy. And she wanted to know what was happening behind the scenes—not just what she was hearing from leadership.</p><p>Where will wireless messaging work? Where won’t it work? What’s the customer experience really going to be? What are the trade-offs?</p><p>I told her. Then I asked what she thought. And that’s when I noticed the sky was falling.</p><p>I hadn’t realized it, but all those people working parallel to me could see things I couldn’t. They had a completely different view of our world—a view that I wanted to understand.</p><p>New perspectives are everywhere. You don’t have to drag a bunch of people off the street to stare at your product and tell you what they think. Start with your internal customers. Everyone in a company has customers, even if they’re not building anything. You’re always making something for someone—the creative team is making stuff for marketing, marketing is making stuff for the app designers, the app designers are making stuff for the engineers—every single person in the company is doing something for someone, even if it’s just a coworker on another team.</p><p>You’re somebody’s customer, too—so talk to whoever is doing work for you. Show up with something of value or a pertinent question. Try to understand what their roadblocks are and what they’re excited about.</p><p>And talk to the people who are closest to the customer, like marketing and support—find teams who communicate with customers day in and day out and hear their feedback directly.</p><p>Come curious. And come genuinely interested. When you’re looking up and around, you’re not on a self-serving mission to understand if your company will fail and how quickly you should cut and run. You’re trying to understand how to do your job better. You’re getting ideas of how to help your project and your company’s mission succeed. You’re starting to think like your manager or leader, which is the first step to becoming a manager or leader.</p><p>And as you do that, you may start seeing things emerge from the haze.</p><p>Hard things. Brick-wall-like things.</p><p>When I finally looked up and around, I realized we were bashing our heads against a wall that was never going to move. Our mission was still inspiring, but our path there was blocked. So I held on to the mission, but I found a new goal to walk toward. I stepped off the path and took a hard left. And that’s how I found my next job.</p><p>The most wonderful part of building something together with a team is that you’re walking side by side with other people. You’re all looking at your feet and scanning the horizon at the same time. Some people will see things you can’t, and you’ll see things that are invisible to everyone else. So don’t think doing the work just means locking yourself in a room—a huge part of it is walking with your team. The work is reaching your destination together. Or finding a new destination and bringing your team with you.</p><p>Part II
Build Your Career
I wanted to save General Magic.</p><p>When it became cruelly clear that no one but our close, geeky friends was going to buy the Magic Link, I nervously pitched an idea to my heroes: let’s pivot. Instead of making a communication and entertainment device for the general public, let’s focus on businesspeople.</p><p>General Magic’s target customer was “Joe Sixpack.” Seriously. It’s a derogatory caricature of an average American slumped on his couch, drinking beer, watching football, not thinking about much of anything. It’s a terrible way to imagine your customer. And even though we repeated it over and over, claimed we were doing it all for him—it was meaningless. Because even if Joe Sixpack existed, he was never going to buy the Magic Link. This was before the internet was remotely accessible, at a time when most people didn’t have a desktop computer, didn’t have email, couldn’t imagine mobile games or movies.</p><p>It was 1992. Joe Sixpack had literally no reason to put a computer in his pocket.</p><p>But businesspeople just might. They were beginning to use email and notes and digital calendars. They needed all their contacts on a mobile device instead of on a ten-pound laptop. They were like my dad—always on the move from city to city. And they were constantly rushing out of cars and planes to feed quarters into pay phones to listen to their voicemails, trying to make deals and catch meetings in an era before cell phones. They had a problem we could solve.</p><p>It was so glaringly, wonderfully obvious. Make a product for people who already saw the need and felt the pain daily. Just take the Magic Link and put a keyboard on it. Strip out the quirks and whimsy—kill the walking lemons—and focus on work. Create a mobile business-oriented device, user interface, and suite of applications. Add word processing and spreadsheets. I started talking to people at General Magic, trying to get them interested. First I pitched it to my peers, then the leadership team.</p><p>“Good idea, but . . .” they said. We went back and forth for a while, everyone trying to be nice. Trying to make it happen. But in the end the answer was a resounding “No.” It was too much work—we’d have to change too much. We can’t do it now. We have other priorities.</p><p>But Philips was in. As a major partner and investor in General Magic, they were already building some semiconductors and processor parts for us, so it was easy to reach out to them. And they liked the idea: build a business-focused pocket computer within Philips, but use General Magic hardware and software. I could keep the dream alive and Philips could keep itself relevant in the emerging world of software-driven devices.</p><p>So in 1995 I closed the door on the General Magic office where we raced remote control cars through the hallways and pranked each other with hidden hot dogs in the ceiling and walked into a whole different world. I knew Philips would be different, but it was shocking.</p><p>Dark wood paneling with smoke stains from the 1970s, no cubicles, constant meetings, managers who just said no to everything. An old guard of old Dutch guys complaining about the lack of Douwe Egberts coffee and frikandel (if you don’t know, don’t ask). Everywhere I looked I saw the same bad suit I’d ditched after my first General Magic interview.</p><p>I was twenty-five years old and had never really managed anyone, never built a team. Now I was one of the CTOs in a massive company of almost 300,000 people. I’d experienced plenty of failure, but this was truly a new and exciting set of experiences to fail at. The rush of imposter syndrome was almost overwhelming.</p><p>Then they told me that anyone who joined the team would have to be drug tested.</p><p>Nothing clears your mind like something that unbelievably stupid. Nobody in Silicon Valley would put up with that—pee into a cup to get an engineering job? I wouldn’t be able to hire a soul. So I told Philips, “Fuck no!” The fuck was silent but written all over my face. Then I made a deal: “I’ll take your test. And if I test negative, no one else I hire on our team will have to take it.” Luckily, I tested negative and we hired some amazing people.</p><p>Then we got to work negotiating with General Magic to get a version of their operating system (OS) that would do what we needed. I knew the code, knew we could make it work. But by that point General Magic was sinking fast. No revenue, no customers, lots of panic. Marc Porat had made many promises to many people and they were all coming up empty. After months of struggling to squeeze an OS out of General Magic, I got the call: Tony, we just can’t do it. Sorry!</p><p>I was left with a job title, a budding team, a budget, and a mission we believed in, but no operating system and half a year down the drain. So we gave up the dream of saving General Magic, reluctantly picked Windows Microsoft CE as our OS, and got to work.</p><p>If General Magic was a blank slate, a hundred artisans lovingly crafting each element from scratch, then Philips was a Lego set. Here are all the pieces we have. Go make something.</p><p>And we did. In 1997 we launched the Philips Velo.</p><p>image
Fig. 2.0.1</p><p>Released in August 1997, the Philips Velo was 6.7 x 3.7 inches, weighed 374 grams, and cost $599.99. It allowed mobile professionals to email, work on spreadsheets and docs, and update their calendar. Velo’s software was built on Windows CE, but its hardware guts were from General Magic.</p><p>Dwight Eschliman</p><p>Velo looked a lot like my pitch at General Magic: a touchscreen and a keyboard, a simpler interface, an explicit focus on business tools.</p><p>The next year came the Philips Nino, Velo’s smaller sibling.</p><p>Velo and Nino both won awards, got critical acclaim. They were the fastest, best-feeling, and had the best battery life of any Windows CE device of the time. I can confidently say that we made the best tools for a Windows-focused businessperson on the go.</p><p>We launched a whole marketing campaign, did TV and print ads, and waited for the customers to roll in.</p><p>image
Fig. 2.0.2</p><p>The Nino launched in 1998. It measured 5.5 x 3.3 inches, weighed 220 grams, and cost $300. Nino had a Windows CE operating system and rudimentary voice control software, and was one of the first devices to adopt downloadable audiobooks from Audible.</p><p>Dwight Eschliman</p><p>But back then electronics were sold in brick-and-mortar stores and could only fit into two categories: TV/audio or computer equipment. There was no “new technology” aisle. There were printers on one side of the building and stereos on the other and best of luck knowing where a PDA might fit.</p><p>So Best Buy put the Velo in the Calculator section.</p><p>Circuit City put the Nino in with Laptops.</p><p>And customers had no idea where to find them. When they asked the sales reps, they’d get blank stares.</p><p>Nobody had any idea how to sell our products. Where to sell them. Who to sell them to. Not the retailers. Not Philips. Our sales team only got bonuses for selling DVD players and TVs. The marketing team was thinking about electric shavers. So Velo and Nino ended up shoved behind a TI-89 calculator and a Toshiba laptop.</p><p>Sales were understandably not great, though not terrible. But it was incredibly frustrating—we had put together all the right pieces except one: a real sales and retail partnership. Another lesson learned via gut punch.</p><p>So it was time to do something different. But not so different that I’d walk away from my employment contract.</p><p>I shifted to a new team: the Philips Strategy &amp; Ventures Group. The job was to help Philips build out its digital strategy and invest in hot new startups. And this is when hot new startups were bursting out of the woodwork. I was a kid in a candy store. We invested in TiVo—the first digital video recorder, a revolutionary technology at the time that let you pause and save live TV—and in Audible, the first online audiobook service.</p><p>I’d actually first encountered Audible when I was building the Nino. They were about to launch their own device, but they weren’t particularly excited about it. They didn’t want to build hardware but knew they needed it to demonstrate the content marketplace they wanted to become. They would have happily demonstrated it on someone else’s hardware—but there was nobody else making devices that could play audio. Not even for their tiny single-channel mono spoken-word files.</p><p>So Nino became one of the first devices in the world to adopt Audible. It took off. People loved it.</p><p>And if we could play audiobooks, why not music? We’d just need a bigger memory. Stereo. Better sound output quality.</p><p>I spent a lot of time thinking about it, playing around with the technology. In 1999 I sent out an invitation to my thirtieth birthday party—it was a mixed custom CD I’d burned with full Red Book audio as well as MP3s—“Gimme Some Lovin’,” “Instant Karma,” “Private Idaho.” Even though almost nobody owned an MP3 player back then.</p><p>But I could see the potential for a new kind of device: one designed purely for audio.</p><p>I talked about it for three hours one day with the CEO of RealNetworks, an incredibly popular technology at the time, the first to create internet streaming audio and video. I’d set up a meeting between the CEOs of our companies to get RealNetworks software on Philips hardware. But the Philips CEO was late. Really late.</p><p>By the time he showed up, I had a new job.</p><p>I joined RealNetworks to build them a new kind of music player. They told me I could create a team in Silicon Valley and use their technology to form a new vision. Their recruiter was very convincing and, truthfully, the best thing I found at Real. When I met various team leaders, I realized some were ridiculously political. I mean that literally—one is in the Senate now. They tried to get me to sign lengthy noncompetes. And on my first day, they went back on their promise and told me I’d have to move to Seattle. I stepped into my new, tiny, hidden office, ducked around the giant structural pole in the middle of it, and gave my notice after two weeks.</p><p>It wasn’t easy. The choice to stay or go, to collect a paycheck or save your sanity, to stick with the big company or jump ship to your own venture—it’s difficult for everyone.</p><p>Just like the specter of management. How do you manage a team when you’ve never managed before? How do you make decisions when everyone’s split on what to do? How do you set a process to make forward progress toward a unified goal? How do you know if you’re headed in the right direction? Or if you should quit?</p><p>The sooner you realize these questions exist, the better. Everyone rising in their career has to face them at some point.</p><p>And I’ll be honest: the first time you encounter them, you’ll probably screw up. Everyone does. That’s okay. You’ll learn and grow and get better. But to make that first big leap into leadership less daunting, I’ve written up a few things that might help.</p><p>Chapter 2.1
Just Managing
If you’re thinking of becoming a manager, there are six things you should know:</p><ol><li><p>You do not have to be a manager to be successful. Many people assume that the only path to more money and stature is managing a team. However, there are alternatives that will enable you to get a similar paycheck, have similar amounts of influence, and possibly be happier overall. Of course if you want to be a manager because you think you’ll love it, then absolutely pursue it. But even then, remember that you don’t have to be a manager forever. I’ve seen plenty of people go back to being individual contributors, then turn around and be managers again in their next job.</p></li><li><p>Remember that once you become a manager, you’ll stop doing the thing that made you successful in the first place. You’ll no longer be doing the things you do really well—instead you’ll be digging into how others do them, helping them improve. Your job will now be communication, communication, communication, recruiting, hiring and firing, setting budgets, reviews, one-on-one meetings (1:1s), meetings with your team and other teams and leadership, representing your team in those meetings, setting goals and keeping people on track, conflict resolution, helping to find creative solutions to intractable problems, blocking and tackling political BS, mentoring your team, and asking “how can I help you?” all the time.</p></li><li><p>Becoming a manager is a discipline. Management is a learned skill, not a talent. You’re not born with it. You’ll need to learn a whole slew of new communication skills and educate yourself with websites, podcasts, books, classes, or help from mentors and other experienced managers.</p></li><li><p>Being exacting and expecting great work is not micromanagement. Your job is to make sure the team produces high-quality work. It only turns into micromanagement when you dictate the step-by-step process by which they create that work rather than focusing on the output.</p></li><li><p>Honesty is more important than style. Everyone has a style—loud, quiet, emotional, analytical, excited, reserved. You can be successful with any style as long as you never shy away from respectfully telling the team the uncomfortable, hard truth that needs to be said.</p></li><li><p>Don’t worry that your team will outshine you. In fact, it’s your goal. You should always be training someone on your team to do your job. The better they are, the easier it is for you to move up and even start managing managers.</p></li></ol><hr><p>You’re great at what you do. An amazing accountant, for example. And your team wants a manager who deeply understands their work, who can help them and represent them to leadership. So you work hard to get promoted and you get the job. Congratulations—now you lead an accounting team.</p><p>No problem. You’re an accountant who’s going to tell other accountants how to do their jobs, right? You can do that. This is going to be an amazing team.</p><p>So you get deep into the weeds, deep into everyone’s work. And they’re doing all kinds of weird stuff—not how you would do it at all. And why is it taking so long? Doing their job well is how you got promoted, so now you’ll just show everyone how to do it right. You’ll tell them—step by step, detail by detail—how to be successful.</p><p>It doesn’t go well. The team doesn’t feel like you trust them. And since you’re stretched so thin, focusing on every detail of everyone else’s process, nobody really knows what they should be working on or what’s most important. People start complaining to you and about you. Everyone gets pissed off.</p><p>The more things go wrong, the more you fall back on doing what you know. And you know accounting. So instead of becoming a better accounting manager, you focus on being the best accountant on the team. You start taking on more tasks that your team should be doing themselves. You withhold your feedback and concerns because you don’t want to demoralize people further. You rally the team by crying, “We’ll get through this! I’ll show you how it’s done! Just watch and follow me!”</p><p>And that’s all it takes. That’s how normal, reasonable people turn into unbearable micromanagers. That’s how projects slow down and disintegrate for lack of leadership. That’s the hole that many people fall into when they’re put in charge of a team. And some never climb out of it.</p><p>Because once you’re a manager, you’re no longer an accountant. Or a designer. Or a fisherman. Or an artist. Or whatever it is you really enjoyed doing. I constantly have to remind people: If you’re doing what you loved in your old job, then you’re probably doing the wrong thing. You now lead a team of people doing what you used to be good at. So at least 85 percent of your time should be spent managing. If it’s not, then you aren’t doing it right. Managing is the job. And managing is hard.</p><p>When I was CTO at Philips, my team put up one of those red flashing lights in the office—the old ones that used to be on police cars. They’d turn it on when there was a problem or if they thought I was in a bad mood. They mysteriously knew when some person or group was going to be called into my office soon to have a little talk. Sometimes a passionately loud little talk.</p><p>The police light was a joke. Kind of.</p><p>I had a team of around eighty people. I was a VP and CTO. I was twenty-five years old. And I was a first-time manager.</p><p>I’d never gone through any management training. I’d never even had a real manager myself. I had no mental model of a good manager that I could emulate.</p><p>Although my startups had employees, there was no real organization structure. No top-down process, no performance reviews, no meetings to clarify roles and responsibilities. I was a founder, but not a real CEO. Mostly I was an individual contributor on a team of 5–10 people—so we were all just in it together. Nobody was managing anybody. <!-- -->[See also: Figure 5.2.1, in Chapter 5.2]</p><p>It was kind of like that at General Magic, too. Our culture was clear: we didn’t need managers. Everyone was smart and could manage themselves. So anyone who tried to be a real manager was pretty much ignored.</p><p>It was great. Until the team grew. Until we needed to launch something and turn all these brilliant minds in one direction. Until we all had to agree on what was necessary and what got cut.</p><p>So when I joined Philips after General Magic, I knew my team would need more structure, that there would have to be defined deadlines and a plan and clear leadership. I knew I’d have to be a manager.</p><p>No problem, I thought. I’m an engineer who’s going to tell other engineers how to do their jobs, right?</p><p>Enter the police light. The stress. And the frustration, for me and the team, the incessant questions and prodding. The micromanagement.</p><p>When you’re a manager, you’re no longer just responsible for the work. You’re responsible for human beings. And while that seems obvious—yes, that’s the whole point of the job—it’s a difficult thing to grapple with when all of a sudden eighty people are looking at you, expecting you to know how to lead them.</p><p>So before you decide to be a manager, you should think hard about whether it’s the right path for you. Because you don’t have to do it. Especially if you don’t really want to, but believe the management ladder is the only way to move up in your career. A lot of people shouldn’t be forced into management—if you’re not really a people person, or you only want to focus on the work, or you thrive on having regular day-to-day successes and accomplishments and the murky maybe-your-team-will-succeed-one-day style of management is less motivating to you.</p><p>A star individual contributor (IC) is incredibly valuable. Valuable enough that many companies will pay them just as much as they’d pay a manager. A truly great IC will be a leader in their chosen function and also become an informal cultural leader, someone who people across the company will seek out for advice and mentorship. Apple formally recognizes and rewards star IC engineers in the Distinguished Engineer, Scientist or Technologist (DEST) program. Google Level 8 engineers have similar amounts of clout and sway. Recognition of incredible ICs is most common in engineering, but it’s becoming more common in other disciplines.</p><p>When considering this path, just make sure you get a very clear view of where you can go in a company over time as an IC. Larger orgs often have clearly defined levels—so find out what the trajectory of an IC is in that organization to understand if they’ll value your work.</p><p>Many companies also offer the option of being a team lead—or at least they should. This is a kind of a midpoint between an IC and manager. You have some authority to critique, shape, and drive the team’s output, but nobody reports to you and you’re not dealing with budgets, org charts, or management meetings.</p><p>That could have been my path. I could have stayed an engineer. Maybe a team lead. It certainly would have been simpler. Quieter.</p><p>But when I finally started looking around at General Magic, I realized coding and designing hardware wasn’t as interesting to me as seeing how the whole product—the whole business—came together. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 1.4: Don’t (Only) Look Down.]<!-- --> It became exceedingly obvious that I could never guarantee success through great engineering alone. The best technology wouldn’t always win—look at Windows 95 versus Mac OS.</p><p>There were all these other squishy elements that needed to align to give any project any chance. Sales, marketing, product management, PR, partnerships, finance—they were all foreign and mysterious and hugely, sometimes desperately, necessary. While I was staring at my feet, workingworkingworking, making the most of a $5 million engineering budget, marketing was getting $10–15 million. I needed to understand why. So I asked.</p><p>And that’s what changed everything. As soon as I started talking to different teams, I realized my superpower.</p><p>A lot of engineers only trust other engineers. Just like finance people only trust finance people. People like people who think like them. So engineers often keep their distance from sales, marketing, creative—all the functions that are soft, squishy.</p><p>It’s just like how many marketing, sales, and creative teams often don’t talk to engineering. Too many numbers. Too black and white. Too many geeks in one room geeking out.</p><p>But I wanted to understand the squishy stuff and the geeky stuff. And I liked all of it. I could also translate back and forth—explain the squish to engineers, translate the 1s and 0s to the creatives. I could synthesize all the pieces and keep the whole company in my head.</p><p>For me, that was thrilling, exciting, inspiring. It was all I wanted to do. And that meant being a manager. I was drawn to the work, but more importantly, the mission required it. The team needed it.</p><p>So I learned how to back off—at least a little bit.</p><p>One of the hardest parts of management is letting go. Not doing the work yourself. You have to temper your fear that becoming more hands-off will cause the product to suffer or the project to fail. You have to trust your team—give them breathing room to be creative and opportunities to shine.</p><p>But you can’t overdo it—you can’t create so much space that you lose track of what’s going on or are surprised by what the product becomes. You can’t let it slide into mediocrity because you’re worried about seeming overbearing. Even if your hands aren’t on the product, they should still be on the wheel.</p><p>Examining the product in great detail and caring deeply about the quality of what your team is producing is not micromanagement. That’s exactly what you should be doing. I remember Steve Jobs bringing out a jeweler’s loupe and looking at individual pixels on a screen to make sure the user interface graphics were properly drawn. He showed the same level of attention to every piece of hardware, every word on the packaging. That’s how we learned the level of detail that was expected at Apple. And that’s what we started to expect of ourselves.</p><p>As a manager, you should be focused on making sure the team is producing the best possible product. The outcome is your business. How the team reaches that outcome is the team’s business. When you get deep into the team’s process of doing work rather than the actual work that results from it, that’s when you dive headfirst into micromanagement. (Of course sometimes it turns out that the process is flawed and leads to bad outcomes. In that case, the manager should feel free to dive in and revise the process. That’s the manager’s job, too.)</p><p>It helps to agree on the process early. To define it up front—here’s our product development process, here’s our design process, our marketing process, our sales process. Here’s our schedule and how we work and how we work together. Everyone—manager and team—signs off on it and then the manager has to let go. They let the team work.</p><p>Then they make sure everything’s heading in the right direction in regular team meetings.</p><p>These meetings should be structured to get you and the team as much clarity as possible. You should have a weekly crib sheet that helps you keep your priorities and the questions you need to ask top of mind. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 4.5: Killing Yourself for Work: Everyone thought I was crazy.]<!-- --> Write down a list of what you’re worried about for each project and person so you can immediately see when the list is getting too long and you need to either dive deeper or back off.</p><p>The other place where you’ll get useful data is in 1:1s with team members. It’s all too easy to turn 1:1s into friendly chats that go nowhere, so just as you need to have a process for your team meetings, your weekly meetings with individuals should have an agenda, a clear purpose, and should be beneficial to both sides. You should get the info you need about product development and your team members should get insight into how they’re doing. Try to see the situation from their point of view—talk about their fears and your own concerns out loud, reframe your thoughts so they can hear the feedback, understand the goals, clear up ambiguities or concerns.</p><p>And don’t be scared of admitting that you don’t know all the answers. You can say, “Help me.” If you’re a first-time manager or simply new to the company or group, just tell people.</p><p>“I’m doing this for the first time. I’m still learning. Please tell me what I can do to make things better.”</p><p>That’s it. But that’s a huge mindset shift. I’ve seen way too many people clam up—terrified that everyone will realize they don’t know what they’re doing. But of course you don’t know what you’re doing—pretending you do will fool no one and only dig yourself in deeper. If you’ve been promoted to management for the first time, you’re probably managing people who used to be your peers. Peers who know and trust you. So hold on to that trust. Tell them, “I know I’m your manager now, but we can still talk just like we always have.”</p><p>And then just be honest with them. Even if things aren’t going well, don’t avoid telling them the hard truth. Tear off the Band-Aid. If either of you is nervous, you can start the conversation with something positive, ease into it, but don’t ignore the elephant in the room, don’t tiptoe around the reason you need to talk. It’s important to remember that even if you have to criticize someone’s work or their behavior, you’re not doing it to hurt them. You’re there to help. Every word should come from a place of caring. So tell them what’s holding them back. Then make a plan to work on it together.</p><p>You’ll most likely be giving formal written performance reviews every six months—or potentially more often if you’re at a company like Google or Facebook where it seems like you’re constantly in some kind of review cycle. But those formal reviews should simply be an exercise in writing down the things you’re talking about every week. The team should be getting your feedback—good and bad—in the moment rather than waiting to be surprised by it a few months down the road.</p><p>I wish there were some magical formula I could tell you for how I figured all this out, but aside from trial and error, I mostly worked on improving myself. I didn’t become an engineer by just snapping my fingers and getting a job—I worked at it. I went to school. I practiced for years. The same process is necessary for management.*</p><p>I started with some management classes. No class will give you all the answers, but any class is better than nothing. And then I went way beyond the basic classes you’ll take at a big company—I went down the rabbit hole. I started reading management books and realized that a great deal of management comes down to how you manage your own fears and anxieties. That led me to psychology books. And that led me to therapy. And yoga. I started both in 1995, long before either was widely accepted. It wasn’t because I was a crazy person or because becoming a manager was turning me into one. I did therapy and yoga for the same reasons: to find balance, to change the way I reacted to the world, to better understand myself and my emotions and how others perceived them.</p><p>The key for me was separating the problems of the company from my personal issues, identifying when my own actions were causing frustrations on the team versus knowing that some things were entirely out of my control. That is difficult stuff to figure out by yourself—it’s hard to dig around in your own brain, just like it’s hard to do yoga at first without an instructor. My therapist was my coach, my teacher—he helped me understand why I was being such a micromanager. He showed me which parts of my personality I needed to control to effectively lead a team.</p><p>Before I learned to create a little distance between what I felt and what I needed to express at work, I let too many of my worries and fears leak into my voice and into my daily interactions. Your team amplifies your mood, so when I was frustrated, those feelings rocketed around the office and came back tenfold. The more upset I got with our lack of progress, the more those frustrations infected the rest of the team. So I had to learn to modulate myself. To crank my personal style down a couple of notches to establish an effective management style.</p><p>But I didn’t try to change who I was. You are who you are. If you have to completely rearrange your personality to become a manager, then it will always be an act and you won’t get comfortable in the role.</p><p>I am a loud and passionate person. I will never be Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet. Sundar is quiet, gentle, brilliant, and highly analytical—he always slowly thinks things through before giving a measured response. I pretty much only have one volume setting: slightly loud with a fast crescendo to VERY EXCITED. My son gave me a decibel meter as a gift once—a joke, sure, but it turns out I’m regularly at 70–80 decibels. I am a noisy restaurant, an alarm clock, a vacuum cleaner. Even if every business book on Earth told me to be a quiet, calming voice on the team, I couldn’t do it all the time.</p><p>So my leadership style is loud and passionate, mission-focused above all else. I pick a goal then run full speed ahead, refusing to let anything stop me, and expect everyone to run with me.</p><p>But I also realize that what motivates me may not be what motivates my team. The world is not made up entirely of Tony Fadells (and let us all be grateful for that). There are also normal, sane people with lives and families and lots of things they can and need to do, all pulling at their time.</p><p>So as a manager, you have to find what connects with your team. How can you share your passion with them, motivate them?</p><p>The answer, as usual, comes down to communication. You have to tell the team why. Why am I this passionate? Why is this mission meaningful? Why is this small detail so important that I’m flipping out right now when nobody else seems to think it matters? Nobody wants to follow someone who throws themselves at windmills for no reason. To get people to join you, to truly become a team, to fill them with the same energy and drive that’s bubbling within you, you need to tell them the why.</p><p>And sometimes you need to supplement it with a little what. What am I getting paid? What will I be rewarded with if I succeed? Even if your team is all fired up about the mission, don’t forget about extrinsic motivation. These are human beings. They may need a raise, a promotion, or even a party. A kind word. Figure out what makes them feel valued. Understand what makes them happy at work.</p><p>Helping people succeed is your job as a manager. It’s your responsibility to make sure they can become the best versions of themselves. You need to create a setting where they can surprise you. And where they can surpass you.</p><p>A lot of people resist that idea—they don’t want to hire people to do their jobs, and hiring someone who can do your job better than you is even more terrifying. It’s something I hear from new startup CEOs over and over: “Well, if I hire someone to do that . . . then what am I going to do?!”</p><p>And the answer, of course, is that whatever you’re hiring for isn’t your job anymore. If you’re a manager or leader or CEO, then your job is to be a manager or leader or CEO. You need to let go of taking pride in your individual daily accomplishments and start taking pride in the accrued wins of your team.</p><p>Kwon Oh-hyun, the former CEO of Samsung Semiconductor and an incredible partner, big brother, and sometimes mentor to me as we worked together closely on the iPod, once put it this way: “Most managers are afraid that the people who work for them are going to be better than them. But you need to think of being a manager more like being a mentor or a parent. What loving parent wants their child NOT to succeed? You want your kids to be more successful than you, right?”</p><p>Of course there’s a natural anxiety about getting shown up. The thought usually goes: “Wait, how can I manage Jane if Jane is better than me? If she excels at this and I don’t, then everyone will think she should be doing my job.”</p><p>And I’m here to break it to you—that might be true. And that’s a good thing.</p><p>Because if someone under you does something spectacular, that just shows the company that you’ve built a great team. And that you should be rewarded for it. There should always be at least one or two people on your team who are natural successors to you. Those are the people you have more 1:1s with, who you pull into leadership meetings, who everyone will begin to notice.</p><p>The more they notice them, the better. That will make it much easier for you to get promoted, because there will be no question about who can run your team when you move into another role.</p><p>There’s a reason everyone congratulates parents when their kids do something great—because the kid’s achievement is their own, but it also reflects the parent’s influence. The parent can take pride in their kid’s accomplishment because they know all the time, effort, guidance, hard conversations, and hard work that went into it.</p><p>If you’re a manager—congratulations, you’re now a parent. Not because you should treat your employees like children, but because it’s now your responsibility to help them work through failure and find success. And to be thrilled when they do.</p><p>One of the people I managed at Apple was Matt Rogers. He was the first intern on the iPod engineering team while he was still in college. Five years later he was senior manager of iPod and iPhone software. He was an obvious superstar—an incredible person and an incredible talent. When I left Apple and started thinking about starting another company, I met with Matt. We became cofounders and together created Nest.</p><p>At Nest we hired an intern named Harry Tannenbaum. Harry is analytical, indefatigable, strategic. Five years later, he was director of business analytics and e-commerce at Google Nest. A year after that, he was director of hardware at Google. After Matt left Nest, he called Harry. They started their company in 2020.</p><p>I am so damn proud of both of them.</p><p>And I can’t wait to meet the next generation of talent who they find and mentor and start companies with.</p><p>If you’re a good manager and build a good team, that team will blast off. So lean into it. Cheer them on when they get promoted. Glow with pride when they kick ass at a board meeting or present their work to the entire company. That’s how you become a good manager. That’s how you start to love the job.</p><p>Chapter 2.2
Data Versus Opinion
You make hundreds of tiny decisions every day, but then there are the critical ones, the ones where you’re trying to predict the future, the ones that will put a lot of resources on the line. In those instances, it’s important to realize what kind of decision you’re faced with:</p><p>Data-driven: You can acquire, study, and debate facts and numbers that will allow you to be fairly confident in your choice. These decisions are relatively easy to make and defend and most people on the team can agree on the answer.</p><p>Opinion-driven: You have to follow your gut and your vision for what you want to do, without the benefit of sufficient data to guide you or back you up. These decisions are always hard and always questioned—after all, everyone has an opinion.</p><p>Every decision has elements of data and opinion, but they are ultimately driven by one or the other. Sometimes you have to double down on the data; other times you have to look at all the data and then trust your gut. And trusting your gut is incredibly scary. Many people don’t have either a good gut instinct to follow or the faith in themselves to follow it. It takes time to develop that trust. So they try to turn an opinion-driven business decision into a data-driven one. But data can’t solve an opinion-based problem. So no matter how much data you get, it will always be inconclusive. This leads to analysis paralysis—death by overthinking.</p><p>If you don’t have enough data to make a decision, you’ll need insights to inform your opinion. Insights can be key learnings about your customers or your market or your product space—something substantial that gives you an intuitive feeling for what you should do. You can also get outside input: talk to the experts and confer with your team. You won’t reach consensus, but hopefully you’ll be able to form a gut instinct. Listen to it and take responsibility for what comes next.</p><hr><p>At General Magic we talked constantly about building a product for Joe Sixpack, but nobody had ever met the guy.</p><p>We did user testing as we finished up engineering, but I’m pretty sure we did little to no user research before that. We had no idea what Joe Sixpack might want, so we built features that we liked and just assumed the rest of the world would fall in line.</p><p>I was an individual contributor then. I figured leadership knew what they were doing. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 1.4: Don’t (Only) Look Down.]</p><p>Then I went to Philips. Now I was leadership. And the pendulum swung hard.</p><p>No more assumptions. No more building by intuition. I’d brought a bunch of General Magic people with me and we were all recovering from the face-melting failure of the Magic Link. We knew we couldn’t make the same mistakes again. We had to understand our target customer and exactly what they wanted. This time our product was going to be based on clear-cut, black-and-white data. And in the nineties, that meant consumer panels. They were all the rage.</p><p>So we hired an external consulting firm and told them we were targeting “mobile professionals.” They set up panels in different states, paying thirty to forty people a hundred bucks each to come see our presentation for a few hours.</p><p>Then we showed them everything. Everything.</p><p>At one point we had ten different prototypes for the tiny little keyboard on the Velo. Which one felt better? Which looked more usable? Which felt more reliable? Did you look at the keyboard or the screen while typing? Did you type with all your fingers? Just your thumbs? Do you like the gray? The black? The blue? The bluish gray?</p><p>We pored over the videotapes of the sessions. Watched their faces, watched their fingers, studied their answers on our little forms. Then the consultants would do the same—they’d collate everything and give a report six weeks later.</p><p>The customer is always right, right?</p><p>Except customer panels can’t design for shit. People just can’t articulate what they want clearly enough to definitely point in one direction or another, especially if they’re considering something completely new that they’ve never used before. Customers will always be more comfortable with what exists already, even if it’s terrible.</p><p>But we fell into the same trap as everyone else. We were wowed by the consultants, excited by the numbers. And we quickly became far too reliant on them: everyone wanted data so they wouldn’t have to make decisions themselves. Instead of moving forward with a design, you’d hear, “Well, let’s just test it.” Nobody wanted to take responsibility for what they were making.</p><p>So you’d run the test. And then run it again. On Monday the customer panel would pick option X. On Friday, the same group would go with option Y. Meanwhile, we were paying millions of dollars to consultants who took a month and a half to put their own slant on everything.</p><p>The data wasn’t a guide. At best, it was a crutch. At worst, cement shoes. It was analysis paralysis.</p><p>And this doesn’t just happen with old-school customer panels. If it had been 2016 rather than 1996, we would have leaned into A/B testing—the omnipresent tool of the internet age. A/B testing just means running a digital experiment where you test option A versus option B with customers. So some see a blue button, some see an orange button, and you see which button gets the most clicks. It’s an incredible tool—infinitely faster than customer panels and so much easier to interpret.</p><p>But even with A/B testing, we probably would have gotten the same muddled results, the same product-killing fear of making the wrong decision.</p><p>Despite the fact that many companies now rabidly test every single element of their product and unquestioningly follow the clicks, A/B and user testing is not product design. It’s a tool. A test. At best, a diagnosis. It can tell you something’s not working, but it won’t tell you how to fix it. Or it can show you an option that solves one hyperlocal issue but breaks something else downstream.</p><p>So you have to design the options and the tests to really know what you’re testing. You have to think through what A and B are rather than let them be randomly assigned by an algorithm or thoughtlessly thrown against a wall to see what sticks. And that takes insight and knowledge of the entire customer journey. You need a hypothesis, and that hypothesis should be part of a bigger product vision. So you can A/B test where the “Buy” button should go on a Web page, whether it should be blue or orange, but you shouldn’t be testing whether or not a customer should buy online.</p><p>If you’re testing the core of your product, if the basic functionality can flex and change depending on the whims of an A/B test, then there is no core. There’s a hole where your product vision should be and you’re just shoveling data into the void.</p><p>In our case—and in the case of every first-generation product—we could have been shoveling forever. There was never going to be enough data to make an assured choice.</p><p>If a product is really new, there’s nothing to compare it to, nothing to optimize, nothing to test.</p><p>We were right to define our target customer clearly, to talk to them and find out what problems they had. But then it was our job to figure out the best way to fix those problems. We were right to ask their opinions and get feedback about our designs. But then it was our job to use those insights to move forward in a direction we believed in.</p><p>Eventually our team figured it out—we stopped throwing money at consultants, stopped spinning in circles, started moving forward and trusting ourselves and the trusted opinions of smart people around us.</p><p>We made decisions. I made decisions. This is in. This is out. This is how it’s going to work.</p><p>Not everyone on the team agreed with me. That’ll happen sometimes when one person has to make the final call. In those moments it’s your responsibility as a manager or a leader to explain that this isn’t a democracy, that this is an opinion-driven decision and you’re not going to reach the right choice by consensus. But this also isn’t a dictatorship. You can’t give orders without explaining yourself.</p><p>So tell the team your thought process. Walk through all the data you looked at, all the insights you gathered, and why you ultimately made this choice. Take people’s input. Listen, don’t react. There may be a minority of team members who agree with the decision; there might be some good feedback that makes you modify your plan. If not, give the speech: I understand your position. Here are the points that make sense for our customers, here are the ones that don’t. We have to keep moving and, in this instance, I have to follow my gut. Let’s go.</p><p>Even if some people on your team don’t love that answer, they’ll respect it. And they’ll trust you—they’ll know that they can speak up and criticize your choices and not get immediately shot down. And then they can sigh, and shrug, and go back to their team, communicate the “why” of the decision, and get on the train.</p><p>That’s what’s always worked for me. It’s how my team at Philips came to accept my decisions.</p><p>However, the ever-changing leadership at Philips never did. Right up until launch, they were asking us for data to prove that a market for our products existed. But when you’re making something new, there’s no way to definitively prove that people will like it. You just have to ship it—put it out into the world (or at least in front of forgiving customers or internal users) and see what happens.</p><p>It’s important at this stage to have a boss who understands the kinds of decisions you’re facing. You need a leader who trusts you, who’s ready to back you up.</p><p>But those kinds of leaders—those kinds of human beings—are hard to find.</p><p>Most people don’t even want to acknowledge that there are opinion-driven decisions or that they have to make them. Because if you follow your gut and your gut is wrong, then there’s nowhere else to cast blame. But if all you did was follow the data and you still failed, then clearly something else was wrong. Someone else screwed up.</p><p>This is often a tactic of people who are trying to cover their asses. It’s not my fault! I just went where the data sent me! The data doesn’t lie!</p><p>That’s why some managers and execs and shareholders demand data even when there is none and then chase that imaginary data directly into the abyss. These are the kinds of people who won’t question their directions and drive their car right off a cliff. If at all possible they want to erase the human element—human judgment—from the equation.</p><p>These are also the people who will call in the big-league, very expensive (and in my opinion worthless) consultants at the drop of a hat. They’ll happily second-guess your decision, then rip it right out of your hands and pass it to people who have no context or understanding of your product, company, or culture.</p><p>When that happens, you need to figure out what’s going on so you can try to steer management in a different direction. Here are a few reasons why a leader may sit on your idea and then call in the consultants:</p><p>Delay. They may be waiting for something—a promotion or a bonus—and don’t want to take a risk until they get it.
Fear for their job. They may be convinced that the consequence of failure is that they’ll lose this project or their position or—if the failure is spectacular enough—their job.
They don’t have the time or don’t want to bother. They don’t believe it’s worth the effort to dig in and really understand the decision, choose from the array of options before them, and take a risk. They just want someone else to do it and make them look smart.
They know what they want but don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings. They want to be seen as “nice” so they’ll just keep testing the water, asking for more data again and again until you’re worn out and exasperated.
So what do you do when you’re stuck with a manager who’s hell-bent on driving off a cliff, ideally while throwing all their money out the window at some consultants? Or what if you have data but it’s inconclusive—nobody can say for sure where it leads? Or what if you need to convince your team to follow you even though you can’t prove you’re heading in the right direction?</p><p>You tell a story. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 3.2: Why Storytelling.]</p><p>Storytelling is how you get people to take a leap of faith to do something new. It’s what all our big choices ultimately come down to—believing a story we tell ourselves or that someone else tells us. Creating a believable narrative that everyone can latch on to is critical to moving forward and making hard choices. It’s all that marketing comes down to. It’s the heart of sales.</p><p>And right now you’re selling—your vision, your gut, your opinion.</p><p>So don’t just hit them with the classic “This is Jane, this is her life, and this is how her life changes when she uses our product” slide. Helping people see things from the customer’s perspective is a critical tool, but it’s just part of what you need to do. Your job in this moment is to craft a narrative that convinces leadership that your gut is trustworthy, that you’ve found all the data that could be gleaned, that you have a track record of good decisions, that you grasp the decision makers’ fears and are mitigating those risks, that you truly understand your customers and their needs and—most importantly—that what you’re proposing will have a positive impact on the business. If you tell that story well, if you bring people along with you on that journey, then they will follow your vision, even if there’s no hard data to back you up.</p><p>Nothing in the world is ever 100 percent sure. Even scientific research with entirely data-based outcomes is actually filled with caveats—we didn’t do this kind of sampling, there was this variant, we need to follow up with this test. The answer may not be the answer. There’s always a chance we’re wrong.</p><p>So you can’t wait for perfect data. It doesn’t exist. You just have to take that first step into the unknown. Combine everything you’ve learned and take your best guess at what’s going to happen next. That’s what life is. Most decisions we make are data-informed, but they’re not data-made.</p><p>As the brilliant, empathetic, refreshingly insightful, and egoless designer Ivy Ross, vice president of hardware design at Google, has said, “It’s not data or intuition; it’s data and intuition.”</p><p>You need both. You use both. And sometimes the data can only take you so far. In those moments, all you can do is take a leap. Just don’t look down.</p><p>Chapter 2.3
Assholes
Throughout your career, you’ll encounter some real assholes. These are (mostly) men and (sometimes) women who come in different flavors of selfish or deceitful or cruel, but have one unifying characteristic: you cannot trust them. They can and will screw you and your team over, either to get something for themselves or just to push you down and make themselves look like the hero. You’ll find them at all levels, as individual contributors and managers, but the greatest concentration is near the top—according to University of San Diego professor Simon Croom, up to 12 percent of corporate senior leadership exhibit psychopathic traits. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 5.1: Hiring: Everyone on the team knew what we interviewed for.]</p><p>However, you will also encounter people who can be very difficult to work with—who are gruff or loud or bossy or infuriating—and who may, at first, seem like assholes, but whose motivations and actions tell a very different story.</p><p>It’s important to realize what kind of person you’re dealing with so you can understand how best to work with them—or, if necessary, how best to get around them.</p><p>Here are the different assholes you might have to deal with:</p><ol><li><p>Political assholes: The people who master the art of corporate politics, but then do nothing but take credit for everyone else’s work. These assholes are typically incredibly risk averse—they’re focused exclusively on surviving and pushing others down so they can reach the top. They don’t make anything themselves—are absent for the real work and tough decisions—but they’ll happily leap in to cry “I told you so” when anybody else’s project has a hiccup, then try to swoop in to “fix” it. They often won’t speak up in large meetings because they never want to be seen by their bosses as being wrong—they can’t risk looking like an idiot. Instead they’ll work in the background to undermine you and everyone else who isn’t on their “team.” These assholes usually build a coalition of budding assholes around them—copycats who see it as their path to success. And there’s always one person who they hate and plot against and have to push out of the way somehow.</p></li><li><p>Controlling assholes: Micromanagers who systematically strangle the creativity and joy out of their team. These assholes can never be reasoned with. They resent any good idea that didn’t come from them and are extremely threatened by anyone on their team who is more talented than they are. They never give people credit for their work, never praise it, and often steal it. These are the assholes who dominate big meetings—who won’t let you get a word in edgewise, and who get defensive and angry if anyone critiques their ideas or suggests alternatives. These assholes are sometimes really good at what they do—they hone their skills to a fine point, then use it to cut down everyone around them.</p></li><li><p>Asshole assholes: They suck at work and everything else. These are the mean, jealous, insecure jerks who you’d avoid at a party, but who inevitably sit immediately next to you at the office. They cannot deliver, are deeply unproductive, so they do everything possible to deflect attention away from themselves. They will lie, craft gossip, and manipulate others to get people off their scent. The only good thing about these assholes is that they’re generally out the door pretty quickly—they can only deflect for so long before people start noticing that they bring zero value. And nobody likes working with them.</p></li></ol><p>In addition, assholes can act in different ways:</p><p>Aggressive: They freak out. They yell. They accuse you of all kinds of nonsense. They sneer at you in a meeting and demean you in front of your manager. These assholes are easy to spot.</p><p>Passive-aggressive: They smile. They nod. They agree with you, act friendly. Then they go behind your back, spread vicious gossip, and try to screw you at every step. This is by far the more dangerous variety of asshole—you don’t see them coming until you feel the knife in your back.</p><p>You will also encounter another kind of person at work who often gets confused with the controlling asshole. While the knee-jerk reaction is to dismiss them as just another egotistical jerk, they have a very different motivation: it’s always to make the work better, not to benefit themselves or hurt others. Most significant, you can trust them. They may not always make decisions you like, but they’re focused on the greater good and will listen to reason if it’s in the best interest of the product and customer. This makes them fundamentally different from true assholes. But it doesn’t make them any easier to work with:</p><ol start="4"><li>Mission-driven “assholes”: The people who are crazy passionate—and a little crazy. They speak most frankly, trampling the politics of the modern office, and steamroll right over the delicate social order of “how things are done around here.” Much like true assholes, they are neither easygoing nor easy to work with. Unlike true assholes, they care. They give a damn. They listen. They work incredibly hard and push their team to be better—often against their will. They are unrelenting when they know they’re right, but are open to changing their minds and will praise other people’s efforts if they’re genuinely great. A good way to know if you’re working with a mission-driven &quot;asshole&quot; is to listen to the mythos around them—there are always a few choice stories floating around about some crazy thing they’ve done, and the people who’ve worked with them closely are always telling everyone that they’re not that bad, really. Most tellingly, the team ultimately trusts them, respects what they do, and looks back at the experience of working with them fondly, because they pushed the team to do the best work of their lives.</li></ol><hr><p>Plenty of people think I’m an asshole.</p><p>It’s usually because I get loud. I ask nicely a few times and then—if we’re still not getting anywhere—I stop asking nicely. I put pressure on myself and the people around me. I don’t let up. I expect the best—from myself, from everyone else. I care deeply about our mission, our team, our customers. I can’t stop myself from caring.</p><p>So I push. If something seems off, if I think there’s a chance we can do better, that the customer can get more, then I do not let up. I do not let things slide. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 6.1: Becoming CEO.]<!-- --> I push people who are experts, who already know how it’s done, how it’s always been done, to find a new way to do it. And that’s a lot to take. It’s not easy to work with. I would never claim otherwise.</p><p>But pushing for greatness doesn’t make you an asshole. Not tolerating mediocrity doesn’t make you an asshole. Challenging assumptions doesn’t make you an asshole. Before dismissing someone as “just an asshole,” you need to understand their motivations.</p><p>There’s a world of difference between being emphatic and passionate to benefit the customer versus bullying someone to appease your own ego.</p><p>It’s not always an obvious difference to the person on the other end. It’s hard to walk into a hurricane and think, Ah, this is a passionate hurricane. I just need to let it blow for a little while and then present some helpful data.</p><p>But some hurricanes can be reasoned with. Some cannot.</p><p>So here’s how to deal with people like me, how to talk down a hurricane: ask why.</p><p>It’s the responsibility of a passionate person—especially a leader—to describe their decision and make sure you can see it through their eyes. If they can tell you why they’re so passionate about something, then you can piece together their thought process and either jump on board or point out potential issues.</p><p>So ask. Don’t be afraid to push. They’ll respect you more if you stand up for what you believe in. Mission-driven “assholes” want to be better at their jobs and fulfill that all-important mission—they want to make sure the company is heading in the right direction.</p><p>So if it’s in the best interest of the customer, they’ll hear you and change their mind. Eventually.</p><p>It’s something I was always telling my team at Apple whenever Steve Jobs went completely off the rails: “Yes, this idea is insane. But sanity will prevail! Even if Steve is wrong today, trust that he’ll get to the right answer sooner or later. We just need to find a better approach and make our case.”</p><p>Prepare for some wind and some hail, but don’t worry about getting swept away: a mission-driven “asshole” might tear apart your work, but they won’t attack you personally. They won’t call you names or fire you for disagreeing with them.</p><p>That’s the difference between a mission-driven “asshole” and a controlling one.</p><p>Controlling assholes won’t listen. They’ll never admit they screwed up. Neither will political assholes. They’ll ignore obvious problems and deflect reasonable feedback, either because it’s not helpful politically or because their ego can’t take it. They don’t protect the product or the customer or the team. They protect themselves.</p><p>And to be clear, Steve Jobs was not one of those assholes. Of course he crossed the line sometimes—he was human—but I didn’t condone it or excuse it and it wasn’t the norm. Steve was a mission-driven “asshole,” a passionate hurricane.</p><p>The best thing for the product would always win out eventually because the product was all that mattered. Steve was always focused on the work. Always.</p><p>It’s the assholes who are focused on people—on controlling people—who make work miserable. Real assholes always make it personal. Their motivation is their ego, not the work. As long as they’re winning, they don’t give a shit about what’s happening to the product or what the customer has to deal with. These are the assholes who make it progressively more difficult to create something you’re proud of.</p><p>Like the manager who told a friend of mine flat out, “Do not talk to the CEO!”</p><p>During product development the CEO would often call her with questions or ideas or just to brainstorm. He couldn’t get the information as fast as he wanted from her manager so he’d come straight to her.</p><p>Her manager was livid. How could she flout the pecking order? That’s not how we do things around here!</p><p>So he said, “Never talk to the CEO. Never call him. Never email him. Only go through me.”</p><p>But she wasn’t calling him. He was calling her. And she wasn’t dumb. If the CEO wanted to talk, she was going to answer. She offered to tell her manager everything they discussed, but that wasn’t good enough. Instead of leaning into the work so he’d have the answers the CEO wanted, he just forbade her from speaking.</p><p>She rolled her eyes and completely ignored his order. But she had to deal with this guy to get her project shipped. So she did the only thing you can do when faced with a controlling asshole:</p><p>Kill ’em with kindness.
Ignore them.
Try to get around them.
Quit.
In that order.</p><p>Start by giving them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe they’ve just had bad experiences before or they had a crappy relationship with whoever they used to work with on your team. Maybe they just don’t understand how to work with you. Maybe this is all just a giant misunderstanding—you’ll get over it and show them this can be a productive relationship.</p><p>First make sure you’re not the problem—that there’s not something you did to give the wrong impression or accidentally cause an issue. Have an open conversation where you acknowledge that you got off on the wrong foot. Be friendly. Be kind. Try to praise them publicly—give them credit for something they’ve done (even if they did it wrong). Sometimes that’s all it takes.</p><p>Sometimes it isn’t.</p><p>After you’ve given it your very best shot—consulted with them, gotten their advice, treated them fairly, had some honest conversations—and you’ve gotten a big pile of nothing in return, then you go on the defensive. If you have a good manager, ask them to protect you from the asshole. See if they can rearrange things so you don’t have to deal with this person and no longer have to hear their input.</p><p>If that doesn’t help, then just ignore them. Stop involving them in your decisions. Ask for forgiveness, not permission—and eventually don’t even bother asking for that. If you’re doing something valuable to the company and clearly worthwhile, then the asshole can yell or scheme all they want, but their hands will mostly be tied. Don’t be aggressive or unpleasant about it—just do your thing.</p><p>Sometimes that can buy you enough time to complete your project in peace.</p><p>Sometimes it can’t.</p><p>After weeks of being ignored, after trying to cut me down in meeting after meeting, tiny slight after tiny slight, one asshole I worked with pulled me into his office—with HR present—looked me straight in the eye, and said, “There are two swinging dicks in this room. And mine is the biggest.”</p><p>I’ll give him one thing: that was hard to ignore.</p><p>I remember sitting there trying to process that statement. What did he expect me to say? Or do? Did he want me to take a swing at him? Was that the goal? It was such a bizarre moment, such a record scratch, that I did the exact right thing. I sat there in silence and stared at him. He kept going—that was just his opening salvo. But I didn’t get into an argument. I didn’t engage. I just rearranged my understanding of the world. Okay, so that’s who this guy really is. This is the game we’re playing. He is not on my team. He doesn’t deserve my respect.</p><p>Now I needed to go on the offensive. And I needed backup.</p><p>If you’re having trouble with an asshole, then typically you won’t be the only one exasperated. So find people who agree with you that this asshole has to go—talk to their peers, talk to HR. Find the right moment and talk to their boss—they’ll usually give you a nod and say they’re already doing something about it. It’ll probably take forever and be very messy, but hopefully they’ll either get off your project or entirely out of your life.</p><p>If that doesn’t work, you can try to transfer teams. But when you’re dealing with a real asshole, their reputation is probably well known in the company. If another team knows that taking you on will bring on the ire of the asshole in question, they might decide it’s not worth the hassle. I remember one instance where a person became a pariah—no other team wanted them, for fear that the losing manager would seek revenge.</p><p>At that point, your only option might be the very last one on the table.</p><p>Quit.</p><p>Tell your boss and HR and whoever else is paying attention that you’ve tried everything and you can no longer work with this person. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 2.4: I Quit: But when you’re at the end of your rope.]</p><p>If you’re valued and useful, leadership will probably scramble to try to keep you and find a way to defuse the situation. The key is always to deliver on a meaningful project. If you’re delivering and they’re not, eventually the assholes are recognized as assholes and become isolated or ineffective. It can take a long, long time, but usually their opinions begin to lose their power and they fade away.</p><p>But not always.</p><p>Sometimes, even if they’re chased out of the organization, they can still screw you over.</p><p>So always keep an eye on social media. Don’t just watch for internal rumblings; remember to check Glassdoor, Facebook, Twitter, Medium, LinkedIn, hell—even Quora. TikTok. Whatever. Pissed-off people will poison the water anywhere. Social media is a new weapon in every asshole’s arsenal. If they fail to get what they want from you at work, they can make things very, very personal very, very publicly.</p><p>This is always problematic and incredibly unpleasant, but if they’re controlling assholes or just your regular, run-of-the-mill asshole-assholes, they’ll probably undermine themselves and the truth will come out eventually.</p><p>Political assholes are a whole other animal.</p><p>The trouble with political assholes is that they often form coalitions with other political assholes. Otherwise pleasant people will watch the assholes get promoted and think that’s the right path for them. So the coalition of assholes will grow and they’ll focus almost exclusively on managing up, so leadership won’t realize what’s happening.</p><p>Political assholes thrive in large organizations where they can pull the kind of Machiavellian BS that makes you sound crazy and paranoid when you’re describing it. They find people who aren’t exceptional at their jobs and protect them in exchange for their allegiance. They get dirt on their peers—who’s having an affair with his admin? Can we get HR to cover it up?—then those people are indebted for life.</p><p>It’s like the mafia. But instead of killing people, they kill good ideas.</p><p>Political assholes need an army to sow seeds of discord or get gossip and funnel it up. That’s how they control people. That’s how they get away with it.</p><p>So how do you fight the mafia?</p><p>You gather together the people you work with and make a plan to step up your game. But you don’t do it to protect yourselves, or to get promotions or power or bonuses or whatever the assholes are after. You band together in service of your customers.</p><p>Political cliques are tit-for-tat, Survivor-esque pyramids, each asshole scrambling and fighting to be on top. Your group should be focused on raising each other up and protecting customers from the assholes’ terrible decisions. When an alliance of assholes starts spreading lies, or stealing ideas, or taking over projects they have no business touching, they will parrot each other’s words to leadership. They will make sure they all have the same narrative. They’ll back each other up until they’re impossible to ignore.</p><p>That’s when your team needs to have a counternarrative. The bullshit-asymmetry theory, Brandolini’s law, will be at play here: “The amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude higher than to produce it.”</p><p>So you need to craft a great story and walk into meetings ready to support each other. Agree ahead of time—make sure everyone knows the script. Gather data to back you up so it’s not just your word against theirs. Then when the asshole pipes up, your crew will have the ammunition and manpower to call them out.</p><p>Hopefully you’ll be able to neutralize the mafia, or at least get them to focus their efforts on easier prey. And the one good thing that comes out of these kinds of battles is that you’ll forge lasting connections with a diverse group of wonderful people.</p><p>After we stopped the assholes from ruining the product and screwing over customers, we could stop crafting narratives. Stop playing the stupid games we never wanted to play in the first place. We could get back to the work we loved.</p><p>That’s the thing about assholes—they’re so incredibly unpleasant that they stand out in your memory. They get a whole chapter in your book. But most people just want to go to the office and make something cool. The vast majority of people who cause you trouble aren’t malicious or Machiavellian—they’re struggling, or first-time managers, or in the wrong job, or just having a really, really bad day. Maybe their kid’s not sleeping. Maybe their mom died. Even the nicest people on Earth can act like assholes sometimes. Or maybe they’re passionate hurricanes who are pushing you further than you thought you could go, because they know you’re talented and that you’re holding yourself back.</p><p>Most people aren’t assholes.</p><p>And even if they are, they’re also human. So don’t walk into a job trying to get anyone fired. Start with kindness. Try to make peace. Assume the best.</p><p>. . . and if that doesn’t work, then remember that what goes around comes around. Although it never comes fast enough.</p><p>Chapter 2.4
I Quit
Stick-to-it-iveness is an important value. If you’re passionate about making something, you’ll need to doggedly pursue it, and that may mean earning less money for a while or staying at a problematic company so you can finish your project.</p><p>However, sometimes you just need to quit. Here’s how you know:</p><ol><li><p>You’re no longer passionate about the mission. If you’re staying for the paycheck or to get the title you want, but every hour at your desk feels like an eternity, then save yourself. Whatever you’re staying for is not worth the soul-sucking misery of a job you cannot bear to get out of bed for.</p></li><li><p>You’ve tried everything. You’re still passionate about the mission but the company is letting you down. So you’ve talked to your manager, to other teams, to HR, and to senior leadership. You’ve tried to understand the roadblocks and pitched solutions and options. But still, your project is going nowhere or your manager is impossible or the company is falling apart. In that case, you should leave that job but stick to the mission and find another team on a similar journey.</p></li></ol><p>Once you do decide to quit, make sure you leave in the right way. You’ve made a commitment, so follow through and try to finish as much of what you started as possible. Find a natural breakpoint in your project—the next big milestone—and aim to leave then. The longer you’re at a company, and the higher up you are, the longer it will take to transition out. Individual contributors can usually give a few weeks to a couple months of notice. CEOs may need a year or more.</p><hr><p>I quit Philips after seeing my projects through—ensuring I had explored every avenue to make my team successful. I quit because we were never going to outshine the competition when everyone was using the same Microsoft operating system that dictated most of our features. I quit after four years of hard work and frustration and learning and personal and professional growth.</p><p>I quit RealNetworks after two weeks because I could see the writing on the wall: I was going to hate that job.</p><p>Even so, I stayed an extra four weeks after I gave my notice. I wrote up options for different businesses they could start, sketched out business plans and project presentations. I wanted to make sure I left them with something tangible—real work built around good ideas—so nobody could say he came and left and screwed us (although I’m sure they said it anyway).</p><p>But I needed to get out of there. The second they went back on their word and told me to move to Seattle, I lost all trust in that company. And you cannot work with people you cannot trust. Everything inside of me screamed that this was only going to go from bad to worse.</p><p>Most people know in their gut when they should quit and then spend months—or years—talking themselves out of it. But I could tell from the start that I would have been well paid and utterly miserable.</p><p>And I want to make it very clear: hating your job is never worth the money.</p><p>I need to repeat that: hating your job is never worth whatever raise, title, or perks they throw at you to stay.</p><p>I know that may ring hollow coming from me, a lucky, wealthy person. But the way I’ve gotten wealthy is not by accepting giant paychecks or titles to do jobs I know I’ll hate. I follow my curiosity and my passion. Always. And that’s meant leaving money on the table—so much money that people thought I might actually be crazy. “Look at what you are walking away from—leading iPhone, leaving Apple? And all that money? What’s wrong with you?”</p><p>But it’s been worth every cent.</p><p>Anyone who’s ever stuck with a job they hated knows the feeling. Every meeting, every pointless project, every hour stretches on and on. You don’t respect your manager, you roll your eyes at the mission, you stagger out the door at the end of the day exhausted, dragging yourself home to complain to family and friends until they’re as miserable as you are. It is time and energy and health and joy that disappear from your life forever. But hey, that title, that stature, that money—it’s worth it all, right?</p><p>Don’t get trapped. Just because you don’t know of any other better options doesn’t mean they don’t exist. There is other money. There are other jobs.</p><p>Once you put out word that you’re looking or that you’ve left your job, new opportunities will most likely come to you. I see this happen with friends all the time. They post an update on LinkedIn and people immediately reach out. Oh! This person is available. That’s exciting.</p><p>Of course, as with everything, it helps to know the right people.</p><p>The key to finding them is networking. By that I don’t mean going to a conference and working the room, handing out your business cards or QR codes and cornering potential employers as they try to eat their stack of tiny sandwiches. I just mean make new relationships, beyond business—talk to people outside your bubble. Get to know what else is out there. Meet some new human beings. Networking is something you should be doing constantly—even when you’re happily employed.</p><p>I remember getting lunch in 2011 with an exec who had just left Apple and was going to start a new company. He’d worked at Apple since the late nineties and had been a protégé of Steve Jobs for years before that. And you’d think he’d have every advantage in the world—he’d spent the last decade working at the highest levels in the heart of Silicon Valley’s most famous company, by the side of its most dynamic leader. Who wouldn’t fund him? Who wouldn’t jump at the chance to work with him?</p><p>But it was as if he’d just gotten out of prison. He’d never talked to anyone outside of Steve’s sphere of influence. He didn’t know who to go to, how to raise money. His only relationship to the world was through Apple, and once he left he was clueless. He figured it out, of course, eventually. But it took so much longer than he expected.</p><p>So don’t get trapped.</p><p>And don’t think of networking as a means to an end—as a tit-for-tat exchange where if you do someone a favor they may do you one in return. Nobody wants to feel like they’re being used.</p><p>You should talk to people and make connections because you’re naturally curious. You want to know how other teams at your company work and what people do. You want to talk to your competitors because you’re all working to solve the same problems and they’re taking a different approach. You want your projects to be successful, so you don’t just talk to your immediate teammates at lunch—you grab lunch with your partners, your customers, their customers, their partners. You talk to everyone: get their ideas and their perspectives. In doing so you may be able to help someone or make a friend or strike up an interesting conversation.</p><p>And an interesting conversation can turn into an interview. Or not. But at least it’ll be interesting. At least you might feel the spark of potential. And that may send you down another pathway, with another conversation. And another. And another. Until you see a light at the other end: a company or job or team that makes you want to go to work again. That helps you start feeling like yourself again.</p><p>And when that happens, quit your old job. Quit, quit, quit.</p><p>But don’t just walk into your manager’s office and throw your notice on their desk and walk away from everything you’ve worked on. Even if you hate your job, don’t leave it in a tangle of loose ends. Finish what you can, clean up what you can’t, and hopefully transition it to the next person who’s inheriting your responsibilities. It may be weeks, or even months. If you’re a manager or senior leader, it’ll honestly feel like forever—I had a nine-month transition out of Google Nest. At Apple, it took twenty months.</p><p>People won’t remember how you started. They’ll remember how you left.</p><p>But don’t let that deter you from making the choice and getting out.</p><p>Once you find yourself in a place where you believe in the mission, everything changes.</p><p>Of course, you may need to quit that job, too. Because once you’re committed to a mission, to an idea—that’s the thing you should stick to. The company is secondary. If you find something that inspires you, then follow the best opportunities to pursue it. I got hooked on personal electronics and followed that passion across five companies. It only became really lucrative at the very end, but it was what I loved to do, so I kept finding new opportunities to do it. Each job took a different angle, a new perspective on the same problem, and eventually I had a rich, 360-degree view of the challenge I wanted to solve and all the possible solutions. The idea was much more precious than the company signing my paychecks.</p><p>But it’s a balance. With RealNetworks it was just bad juju all around, an immediate loss of trust, but the other companies I worked at for four years, five years, almost a decade. If you’ve found a good opportunity to follow your passions, you should not give up until you’ve tried to make it work at the company you’re at.</p><p>So if something’s not working, don’t just complain to people who have no power to fix it, then throw up your hands and quit. Even talking to your manager isn’t enough. Especially if it’s your manager that’s the problem.</p><p>If the mission you’re excited about is growing dimmer because of internal politics or poor administration or leadership churn or simply bad decisions, don’t be shy. Get to networking. Talk to everyone. Not watercooler talk or internal gossip, not just complaining with no solutions. Come with suggestions to fix the intractable problems that you and your team face. Speak to your manager, HR, other teams—find appropriate leaders who will listen. Hopefully some will agree with you, or challenge your view or help you refine your thinking. It’s all useful. Get their perspectives.</p><p>That includes senior leadership. Executives. You could even go to board members and investors if you can get ahold of them. That’s what I did—at Philips, at Apple. Get up as high as you can and let them know what the issues are. You’ll probably quit anyway if these issues aren’t solved, so you have nothing to lose.</p><p>Most people at the top are interested to hear what’s happening down below. They may reward you for bringing it to their attention. They may even share your frustrations (although they might not tell you that).</p><p>And yes, you’ll probably drive your boss nuts. Going around your manager is always touchy. I drove my managers completely insane every time I sidestepped them to reach out to some other executive. So if they ask, tell your boss what you’re doing—and tell them why. This is a time to ask for forgiveness, not permission. Explain that you’ve talked to them (and you should have first) but nothing is getting fixed. Tell them what you’re worried about and your proposed solutions; explain who you’re reaching out to and what you hope to accomplish.</p><p>But if you take this route—if you go around your boss and start making a fuss all over the company—make sure the issues you’re raising are not about yourself.</p><p>I remember we had a huge all-hands meeting at Apple once—these meetings would only happen two, maybe three times a year. And a guy stands up during the Q&amp;A and starts asking Steve Jobs why he didn’t get a raise or a good review. Steve looks at him in stunned disbelief and says, “I can tell you why. Because you’re asking this question in front of ten thousand people.”</p><p>He was fired shortly thereafter.</p><p>So don’t be that guy.</p><p>You can have personal problems—not enough money, glacial career progression—or you can have issues with the project you’re working on. Quitting because of personal problems is completely valid; complaining about them to everyone at the company is not. And you don’t have to mess up in front of ten thousand people, either—whining constantly to just one executive about your stock grants is almost as bad.</p><p>If you’re going to get everyone’s attention, make sure it’s to support the mission, not for personal gain. Think through the problems that are plaguing your project. Write down thoughtful, insightful solutions. Present them to leadership. Those solutions may not work, but the process will be at the very least educational. Don’t nag, but be persistent, choose your moment wisely, be professional, and don’t hold back about the consequences if you don’t succeed. Tell them you’re passionate about making this job work, but if you can’t solve these issues then you’ll probably quit.</p><p>But you have to mean it. It can’t just be a negotiation ploy. Too many people trash their career at a company because they had a tantrum. You absolutely cannot threaten to quit, then hesitate and flip-flop and stay. Everyone will instantly lose respect for you. You have to follow through.</p><p>The threat of leaving may be enough to push your company to get serious and make whatever change you’re asking for. But it might not. Quitting should never be a negotiating tactic—it should be the very last card you play.</p><p>And remember that even if leadership acknowledges that you’re right and promises a major shift, it may take a while for anything to change. Or it may never change. But it’s worth it to try. Quitting anytime things get tough not only doesn’t look great on your résumé, but it also kills any chance you have of making something you’re proud of. Good things take time. Big things take longer. If you flit from project to project, company to company, you’ll never have the vital experience of starting and finishing something meaningful.</p><p>Jobs are not interchangeable. Work is not just a sweater you can take off when things get hot. Too many people jump ship the second they need to dig in and really push through the hard, grinding work of making something real. And when you look at their résumés you can instantly see the pattern.</p><p>A two-page résumé can tell the story of a three-hundred-page novel once you know what you’re looking for. And too many plots have giant holes in them.</p><p>So before you quit, you’d better have a story. A good, credible, and factual one. You’ll need to have a rationale for why you left. And you’ll need one for why you want to join whatever company you’re heading to next. These should be two very different narratives. You’ll need them for the interview, but also for yourself—to make sure you’ve really thought things through. And to make sure you’re making the right choice for the next job.</p><p>Your story about why you left needs to be honest and fair and your story for your next job needs to be inspiring: this is what I want to learn, this is the kind of team I want to work with, this is part of the mission that truly excites me.</p><p>Keep this in mind when the recruiters reach out. Because if you’re successful, they will. Knowing when to quit and follow a recruiter is a two-stage process: first you have to know your job is no longer for you, and then you have to decide the new place is better. Too many people conflate the two, get dazzled by the recruiter’s sales proposition, and ignore the opportunities they have where they work right now. Or they don’t network internally so they don’t even realize what opportunities there are. I’ve seen too many people jump ship before doing their research and really thinking things through. They usually come back three to six months later, tail between their legs, sheepishly asking for their old job back.</p><p>So don’t be that person, either.</p><p>But when you’re at the end of your rope, truly at the end—not just impressed by a recruiter—then don’t be scared to walk away.</p><p>I quit Apple three times. The first time was right after we launched the iPod. Our team moved mountains to deliver it months faster than anyone thought possible, to rave reviews. And we did it despite the fact that my manager was doing his best to take credit for our team’s hard work <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 2.3: Assholes.]</p><p>I’d tried everything—engaging him, ignoring him, fighting him, soothing his ego—but now the project was done. My team had worked nonstop for ten months. So I asked for what was promised—the title I should have already had. “When do I get VP?”</p><p>And he said, “Let’s wait a year. These things take time. No one gets promoted that fast.”</p><p>He knew damn well that I deserved a higher title from the start, that he’d stiffed me on the way in (you can read the full story in Walter Isaacson’s Steve Jobs, if you’re curious). But now I had delivered. I’d overdelivered.</p><p>I tried to stay calm. I explained my reasoning. He simply shrugged and gave a half grin. “Sorry. Not now.”</p><p>The last scrap of respect I had for him flew out the window.</p><p>I still believed in the mission. I was proud of what we’d made. I was excited to keep going. But there was no getting around this guy. He was going to screw me over no matter how great a job I was doing. This was a wound that would not heal.</p><p>Enough was enough. So I said the only thing that was left to say: “I quit.”</p><p>Sometimes the only way to save yourself is to walk out the door.</p><p>Two weeks later, as I was packing up my office, I got a call from Cheryl Smith, the human resources leader charged with overseeing our iPod team. She was an incredible partner who’d opened my eyes to how the Apple machine worked and helped me navigate it when I was a newbie. “I heard what happened,” she said. “It makes absolutely no sense. You can’t leave! Let’s go for a walk.”</p><p>The longer we walked around the Apple campus and I told her the details of what went down, the louder we got, the more we gestured wildly in the air. She was empathetic, said she’d work on it, told me to hold tight—but I figured it was too late. Twenty-four hours later I was going to leave Apple for good.</p><p>The next day, a few hours before they were planning to escort me out, I got a call from Steve Jobs.</p><p>“You’re not going anywhere. We’ll get you what you want.”</p><p>I marched over to my manager’s office. Cheryl was waiting outside with a wide grin.</p><p>My manager had reluctantly come to the table, although he was grimacing, hating every minute of it. “This is not how we do things around here,” he muttered as he signed the paperwork to get me my promotion.</p><p>That evening, I walked into my goodbye party and said, “I’m staying!”</p><p>As time passed I had to quit again. This time to protect the product and the team. And then once more—that time to protect my sanity and my family. And there was drama, of course. A tremendous amount. Turning away from my team, from Steve, was not easy.</p><p>But I knew it was the right move. After a decade of dedicating all my energy to Apple, it was time to walk away.</p><p>Sometimes all the calculations, negotiations, discussions with your manager and meetings with HR are entirely beside the point. Sometimes it’s just time to go. And when that moment comes, you’ll probably know.</p><p>Quit and go do something you’ll love.</p><p>Part III
Build Your Product
The basic technology for the first iPod wasn’t designed at Apple.</p><p>It wasn’t even designed for a handheld device.</p><p>In the late nineties people began filling up their hard drives with MP3 audio files. For the first time high (enough) quality music could be stored in small enough files that you could download vast song libraries to your computer.</p><p>But even if you had a lavish stereo system to listen to that music on, you couldn’t use it. Stereos were built for tapes and CDs, so everyone just played their newly downloaded music out of their crappy computer speakers.</p><p>In 1999 I saw the potential for something better. Not an MP3 player—a digital audio jukebox.</p><p>It would let you convert all your CDs to MP3s so you could listen to them, plus whatever you downloaded, on your TV and home stereo system. Before the iPod’s famous tagline “1000 songs in your pocket,” we were trying to make “1000 CDs in your home theater.”</p><p>That’s what I pitched to RealNetworks, anyway. But that was the wrong place, wrong people, wrong everything. So I figured—screw it. I’ll do it myself.</p><p>The words that launched a thousand startups.</p><p>I called mine Fuse Systems.</p><p>The inspiration came from a project at Philips. They’d tried to build a home theater + DVD player that ran Windows so you could browse the internet on your TV and sort of stream audio from the Web (as well as you could stream anything pre-Wi-Fi).</p><p>It was the kernel of a good idea. Home internet connections were speeding up, from 56kbps to a blazing 1mbps, making audio and even grainy, stamp-sized video downloads possible. It became clear that people’s music and movie collections were going to move onto computers. But nobody wanted to listen to music on the sad, gray, corporate Windows computers we had in the nineties. Home theaters were much better—they had HDTV and surround sound. But only the most refined audiovisual geeks could install them.</p><p>Philips could see that, but they couldn’t capitalize on it. They got elbow deep in Microsoft, building a PC with delusions of being a stereo. They were focused on what they could make, not why anyone would want it. I looked it over and thought: No. Nonono. You can’t use Windows—I’d been bashing my skull against a Microsoft OS for years and knew it was a dead end for consumer electronics. Who wants to wait two minutes for their TV to boot up? And you had to simplify the home theater for nongeeks. Make something that anyone could just plug and play.</p><p>I wanted to build one component that would hook up to the internet, but wouldn’t look or feel like a computer. Fuse was going to give people a consumer electronics experience: you’d be able to configure and order a whole home theater, including a CD/DVD player that would save your music to a built-in hard drive. Then you’d connect to the world’s first online store to download more songs, and one day, movies and TV shows. TiVo was all the rage then but I wanted Fuse to go further.</p><p>I got a little seed money and then I was in it. I had to build a company. And not a side-job, small-potatoes college startup. A real company. A serious business.</p><p>image
Fig. 3.0.1</p><p>We used these drawings in the Fuse pitch deck to illustrate how the internet and music and TVs could come together. The MP3 player makes me chuckle. The ad for pets.com makes me laugh out loud.</p><p>Tony Fadell</p><p>I was going to get it right this time. We were going after the world’s biggest players. We were going to challenge Sony.</p><p>But first I had to convince people to come work with me. I’d walked away from Philips’s enormous infrastructure, their mountains of process and cash, and walked right onto a blank slate. I had a big idea but not much else. And all these people I was trying to recruit—they expected to get paid. They expected health care. They expected HR and accounts payable and all the stuff you take for granted when you work at an actual business.</p><p>So I got to work. And work. And work. And work.</p><p>I built the team—hired twelve people. We partnered with Samsung, at the time a little-known Korean consumer brand trying to break into the American market. The plan was that we’d design everything, Samsung would manufacture it; we’d put our brand on it and sell it. People would customize their home theater system with our digital components, add in Samsung’s rebranded TVs, speakers, etc., and order it all online. Then it would get delivered to their house in one easy-to-manage bundle.</p><p>It was 1999. Silicon Valley was exploding with money and talent and ideas and we were on our way. I was going to make up for the failure of General Magic and the wasted potential of the Velo and Nino. I was inspired. Determined.</p><p>Nothing could stop us.</p><p>And those, of course, are the words that launched a thousand startups right off a cliff.</p><p>In April 2000 the internet bubble burst. Just as I started looking for funding, the steady waterfall of money that had been pouring into Silicon Valley dried up overnight. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 4.3: Marrying for Money: The world of investment is cyclical.]</p><p>I did eighty pitches to different venture capital firms. Eighty. All of them failed. Investors were scrambling to save the startups they’d already (over)invested in, and nobody was interested in funding pricey consumer electronics when the stock market was tanking, companies were going belly-up, and billions of dollars were flowing down the drain. Timing is everything and my timing couldn’t have been worse. I couldn’t raise a dime.</p><p>One day at the peak of my desperate, scrabbling attempt to fund my company, I had lunch with an old friend from General Magic. I told him what I was working on and what I was struggling with—the swirling, nauseating mix of excitement about what we were creating and the sinking horror that I’d have to shut it all down. He commiserated, ate his sandwich, and wished me well.</p><p>The following afternoon he had lunch with a colleague who worked at Apple. They mentioned they were kicking off a new project. Did he happen to know anyone with experience building handheld devices?</p><p>I got a call from Apple the next day.</p><p>Because you’ve picked up this book, the rest of the story is probably pretty familiar. I took a consulting gig with Apple at first, just hoping to make enough money to pay my employees or maybe leverage my job into a buyout for Fuse. Putting my hopes on Apple was a serious long shot. Steve Jobs was back at the helm then, but during the previous decade Apple had been in a death spiral, launching a slew of mediocre products that edged the company close to collapse. The Macintosh was struggling to break 2 percent market share in the United States; their computer sales were stagnating. At the time Apple’s market cap was around $4 billion. Microsoft’s was $250 billion.</p><p>Apple was dying. But Fuse was dying faster.</p><p>So I took the job.</p><p>image
Fig. 3.0.2</p><p>This is the Styrofoam model I made in March 2001 to convince Steve to green-light the iPod project.</p><p>Dwight Eschliman</p><p>The call from Apple came the first week of January 2001.
A couple of weeks later I became a consultant leading the iPod investigation. But it wasn’t the iPod yet. The code name was P68 Dulcimer—and there was no team, no prototypes, no design, nothing.
In March, Stan Ng and I pitched the idea for the iPod to Steve Jobs.
The first week of April I became a full-time employee and pulled the Fuse team with me.
By the end of April, Tony Blevins and I found our manufacturer, Inventec, in Taiwan.
In May I hired DJ Novotney and Andy Hodge, the first additions to the original Fuse team.
On October 23, 2001—ten months from when I started—the iPod emerged into the world, our fat plastic-and-stainless-steel baby.

Fig. 3.0.3</p><p>This was the first iPod, released in October 2001 with the famous tagline “A thousand songs in your pocket.” It was 4.02 x 2.43 inches, had a $399 price tag, and was pretty damn close to the original vision model I’d cut seven months before.</p><p>Dwight Eschliman</p><p>I was incredibly lucky to lead the team that made the first eighteen generations of the iPod. Then we got another incredible opportunity—the iPhone. My team created the hardware—the metal and glass that you held in your hand—and the foundational software to run and manufacture the phone. We wrote the software for the touchscreen, the cellular modem, the cell phone, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc. Then we did it again for the second-generation iPhone. And then again for the third.</p><p>I blinked and it was 2010.</p><p>I spent nine years at Apple. It’s the place where I finally grew up. I wasn’t just managing a team anymore. I was leading hundreds, thousands of people. It was a profound shift in my career and in who I was.</p><p>After a decade of failure, I finally made something—actually two things—that people actually wanted. I finally got it right.</p><p>But it didn’t feel like success at first. Or even in the end. It was still work, every step of the way.</p><p>Apple is where I learned where to draw the line—is it done enough? Is it good enough?</p><p>It’s where I learned the real meaning of design.</p><p>And it’s where I learned to organize my brain and my team in the face of intense, grinding, never-ending pressure.</p><p>So if you’re headed into a new phase of your career, navigating at higher and higher levels, building teams, building relationships, trying to find your footing further and further away from the actual thing you’re making but responsible for so much more than before, stressed out beyond belief, then I’m here to share what I’ve learned.</p><p>Chapter 3.1
Make the Intangible Tangible
People are easily distracted. We’re wired to focus our attention on tangible things that we can see and touch to the point that we overlook the importance of intangible experiences and feelings. But when you’re creating a new product, regardless of whether it’s made of atoms or electrons, for businesses or consumers, the actual thing you’re building is only one tiny part of a vast, intangible, overlooked user journey that starts long before a customer ever gets their hands on your product and ends long after.</p><p>So don’t just make a prototype of your product and think you’re done. Prototype as much of the full customer experience as possible. Make the intangible tangible so you can’t overlook the less showy but incredibly important parts of the journey. You should be able to map out and visualize exactly how a customer discovers, considers, installs, uses, fixes, and even returns your product. It all matters.</p><hr><p>When I was a kid I spent a lot of time with my grandfather building stuff—birdhouses, soapbox derby cars. We’d fix up lawn mowers and bikes or work on additions to the house.</p><p>It felt good. So much of life as a child was confusing and out of my control, but there was no ambiguity to physical objects. You built them, held them in your hands, handed them to others. Satisfying. Clean.</p><p>Even after I dove headfirst into programming, I didn’t question my innate belief that the computer itself was the key to everything. Electrons were nothing without atoms.</p><p>That’s why I was so excited about joining General Magic after college. I’d been programming and programming but now I was going to make a thing. A device, a physical object, a computer like the one that had changed my life.</p><p>But the longer I made things—at General Magic, at Philips, at Apple—the more I realized that many things don’t need to be made.</p><p>After the iPod a lot of people started pitching me their devices. People would say, “Tony’s the hardware guy—he’ll love your idea.” And the first thing I did when someone proudly handed me their beautifully polished prototype was put it aside. “How can you solve your problem without this?”</p><p>They would be astonished. How could the “hardware guy” not want to check out my cool gadget?</p><p>People often get excited about making something with atoms—they dig into the design, interface, colors, materials, textures—and instantly become blind to simpler, easier solutions. But making anything with atoms is incredibly difficult—it’s not an app that you can copy and update with a click. The only time hardware is worth the headache of manufacturing and packaging and shipping is if it’s critically necessary and transformative. If hardware doesn’t absolutely need to exist to enable the overall experience, then it should not exist.</p><p>Of course, sometimes you do need hardware—it can’t be avoided. But when that happens, I still tell people to put it away. I say, “Don’t tell me what’s so special about this object. Tell me what’s different about the customer journey.”</p><p>Your product isn’t only your product.</p><p>It’s the whole user experience—a chain that begins when someone learns about your brand for the first time and ends when your product disappears from their life, returned or thrown away, sold to a friend or deleted in a burst of electrons.</p><p>image
Fig. 3.1.1</p><p>Makers often focus on the shiny object—the product they’re building—and forget about the rest of the journey until they’re almost ready to deliver it to the customer. But customers see it all, experience it all. They’re the ones taking the journey, step-by-step. And they can easily stumble and fall when a step is missing or misaligned.</p><p>Matteo Vianello</p><p>Your customer doesn’t differentiate between your advertising and your app and your customer support agents—all of it is your company. Your brand. All of it is one thing.</p><p>But we forget. Too often makers only think of the user experience as that moment when the customer touches an object or taps a screen. The moment they actually use the thing—whether it’s made of atoms or bits or both. The thing is always central.</p><p>That’s what happened in the early days of Nest. Everyone was obsessed with the thermostat—crafting the design, the AI, the device UI, the electronics, the mechanical bits, colors, textures. They thought carefully through every element of installing it, how it should feel when you turn the dial, how brightly it should glow when you walk past. They worked tirelessly on the hardware and software, making sure the device itself was perfect.</p><p>But we weren’t paying enough attention to what was probably the most important part of the customer experience: the app on your phone.</p><p>The team figured it was simple—just an app. We’d made an early prototype in 2011 when we’d first started thinking about the experience, but then didn’t return to it, didn’t revise it as the thermostat evolved.</p><p>The team figured they’d get around to it. Eventually. There were so many things to work on and it’s just a mobile application. We can figure it out fast.</p><p>This is one of the times I got a little loud. Okay, really loud.</p><p>The app wasn’t a throwaway element or something that you could add later—it was just as important as the thermostat. People needed to control this thing from anywhere in the world. Or from the couch. It was absolutely critical to our success and one of the hardest things to get right.</p><p>The thermostat was important, of course, but it occupied only a tiny fraction of the customer journey:</p><p>10% of our customers’ experience was the website, advertising, packaging, and in-store display: first we had to convince people to buy it or at least consider and research it.
10% was installation: following the instructions to get it onto your wall with minimal nervousness and power outages.
10% was looking at and touching the device: it had to be beautiful so people would want it in their homes. But after a week it learned what you liked and when you were away, so you didn’t really need to touch it much. If we did our job right, customers would only interact with it here and there, during unexpected cold snaps or heat waves.
70% of the customer experience was on people’s phones or laptops: you’d open the app to turn up the heat on the way home, or you’d see how long the AC was on in Energy History, or you’d tweak your schedule. Then you’d check your email and see a summary of how much energy you used that month. And if you had an issue, you’d go to our website and use the online troubleshooter or read a support article.
If we didn’t execute well on any one of these parts of the customer experience, Nest would have failed. Each phase of the journey has to be great in order to move customers naturally into the next, to overcome the moments of friction between them.</p><p>There are bumps between Awareness and Acquisition, between Onboarding and Usage, between every phase of the journey, that you have to help customers over. In each of these moments, the customer asks “why?”</p><p>Why should I care?</p><p>Why should I buy it?</p><p>Why should I use it?</p><p>Why should I stick with it?</p><p>Why should I buy the next version?</p><p>Your product, marketing, and support have to grease the skids—continually communicate and connect with customers, give them the answers they need, so they feel like they’re on a smooth ride, a single continuous, inevitable journey.</p><p>To do that right, you have to prototype the whole experience—give every part the weight and reality of a physical object. Regardless of whether your product is made of atoms or bits or both, the process is the same. Draw pictures. Make models. Pin mood boards. Sketch out the bones of the process in rough wireframes. Write imaginary press releases. Create detailed mock-ups that show how a customer would travel from an ad to the website to the app and what information they would see at each touchpoint. Write up the reactions you’d want to get from early adopters, the headlines you’d want to see from reviewers, the feelings you want to evoke in everyone. Make it visible. Physical. Get it out of your head and onto something you can touch. And don’t wait until your product is done to get started—map out the whole journey as you map out what your product will do.</p><p>That’s how you hack your brain. How you hack the brains of everyone on your team.</p><p>Start from that very first moment of the customer journey. You should be prototyping your marketing long before you have anything to market.</p><p>At Nest, that meant focusing on the box.</p><p>The packaging led everything. The product name, the tagline, the top features, their priority order, the main value props—they were literally printed on a cardboard box that we constantly held, looked at, tweaked, revised. The physical limitations of the box forced us to zero in on exactly what we wanted people to understand first, second, third. To fit the tiny space, the creative team crafted crisp descriptions that we could later use in our videos, our advertising, on our website, and in interviews with press. To evoke the Nest brand, they covered the box in warm, rich photos that allowed people to imagine this object in their own homes, their own lives.</p><p>image
Fig. 3.1.2</p><p>Almost a year before we launched the Nest Learning Thermostat—before we were even sure of its name—we already had this early packaging prototype that we used to refine our marketing messaging.</p><p>Manual Creative</p><p>image
Fig. 3.1.3</p><p>This is what we actually launched with in October 2011. The words focused on learning and energy savings; the design made it feel simple and premium.</p><p>Erik Charlton</p><p>We turned the box into a microcosm of all our marketing so someone walking through a store could pick it up and immediately grasp everything we wanted them to know.</p><p>But to prototype this moment properly—to truly understand the half second when someone notices the packaging and leans forward to pick it up—you can’t just call this theoretical person “someone.”</p><p>We had to know them. Who were they? Why would they pick up the box? What would they want to know? What was most important to them?</p><p>We took everything we’d learned about the industry and Nest’s potential customers, about demographics and psychographics, and we created two distinct personas. One was a woman and the other a man. The man was into technology, loved his iPhone, was always looking for cool new gadgets. The woman was the decider—she dictated what made it into the house and what got returned. She loved beautiful things, too, but was skeptical of super-new, untested technology.</p><p>We gave them names and faces. We made a mood board of their home, their kids, their interests, their jobs. We knew what brands they loved and what drove them crazy about their house and how much money they spent on heating bills in the winter.</p><p>We needed to look through their eyes to understand why the man might pick up the box. And so we could convince the woman to keep it.</p><p>Over time we added more personas—couples, families, roommates—as we better understood our customers. But in the beginning we started with two—two human beings who everyone could imagine, whose photos they could touch.</p><p>That’s how prototyping works. It’s how you make abstract concepts into physical representations. You turn your messaging architecture into words and pictures on a box. <!-- -->[See also: Figure 5.4.1, in Chapter 5.4.]<!-- --> You turn “someone in a store” into Beth from Pennsylvania.</p><p>And then you keep going. Every step of the way, along every link of the chain.</p><p>When we had prototypes of the actual thermostat, we sent it out to real people to test. We knew self-installation was potentially a huge stumbling block, so everyone waited with bated breath to see how it went. Did people shock themselves? Start a fire? Abandon the project halfway through because it was too complicated?</p><p>Soon our testers reported in: It went fine. Everything’s up and running! But it took about an hour to install.</p><p>We winced. Crap. An hour was way too long. Beth from Pennsylvania would not be cool with turning off the power, opening up the wall, and fiddling with unknown wires for an hour. This needed to be an easy DIY project, a quick upgrade.</p><p>So we dug into the reports—what was taking so long? What were we missing?</p><p>Turns out we weren’t missing anything—but our testers were. They spent the first thirty minutes looking for tools—the wire stripper, the flathead screwdriver; no, wait, we need a Phillips. Where did I put that little one again?</p><p>Once they got everything they needed, the rest of the installation flew by. Twenty, thirty minutes tops.</p><p>I suspect most companies would have sighed with relief. The actual installation took twenty minutes, so that’s what they’d tell customers. Great. Problem solved.</p><p>But this was going to be the first moment people interacted with our device. Their first experience of Nest. They were buying a $249 thermostat—they were expecting a different kind of experience. And we needed to exceed their expectations. Every minute, from opening the box to reading the instructions to getting it on their wall to turning on the heat for the first time, had to be incredibly smooth. A buttery, warm, joyful experience.</p><p>And we knew Beth. Searching for a screwdriver in the kitchen drawer—then the toolbox in the garage; no, wait, maybe it’s in the drawer after all—would not make her feel warm and buttery. She would be rolling her eyes by minute five. She would be frustrated and annoyed.</p><p>So we changed the prototype. Not the thermostat prototype—the installation prototype. We added one new element: a little screwdriver. It had four different head options, fit in the palm of your hand. It was sleek and cute. But more importantly, it was unbelievably handy.</p><p>image
Fig. 3.1.4</p><p>The original Nest screwdriver cost around $1.50 to make, so including it in every box was hugely controversial on a team that was focused on being lean and profitable. But the screwdriver’s friendly shape made installing the thermostat yourself seem less daunting and it was so handy that it functioned as a marketing tool long after sale.</p><p>Dwight Eschliman</p><p>So now, instead of rummaging through toolboxes and cupboards, trying to find the right tool to pry their weird old thermostat off the wall, customers simply reached into the Nest box and took out exactly what they needed. It turned a moment of frustration into a moment of delight.</p><p>And then it turned into a lot more than that.</p><p>The screwdriver was never just for installation. It had ripple effects all the way up and down the customer journey.</p><p>A vital part of the customer experience is post-sale. How do you stay connected to your customer in a way that’s actually useful? How do you keep on delighting people instead of just marketing to them, selling and selling until they’re sick of you?</p><p>Our thermostat was made to be on people’s walls for ten years. By design, it would become like a piece of art—occasionally admired and adjusted, mostly fading into the background.</p><p>But every time they opened the random-stuff drawer in their kitchen, they’d see the cute little Nest screwdriver. And they’d smile.</p><p>Every time they’d need to replace the batteries in their kid’s toy car, they’d grab our screwdriver. And suddenly the screwdriver became the toy and the car was forgotten.</p><p>We knew it wasn’t just a hardware tool—it was a marketing tool.</p><p>It helped customers remember Nest. It helped them fall in love.</p><p>And it helped people discover us. Journalists wrote articles about the screwdriver. It appeared in every five-star review. It was free PR, a boost to word of mouth. Instead of a bowl of candy at the Nest front desk, we had a bowl full of screwdrivers. It became a symbol for the entire user experience—thoughtful, elegant, long-lived, and deeply useful.</p><p>That’s why I wouldn’t let anyone strip it out.</p><p>It was a constant battle with every new generation of thermostat. The screwdriver was expensive. Each one ate into our margins. So there was always a brigade of employees petitioning to remove it—they couldn’t understand why we’d add to our COGS (cost of goods sold) that way.</p><p>But they didn’t understand that it wasn’t a straight COGS line item. It was a marketing expense. And a support expense. That screwdriver saved us so much money on phone support. Instead of angry calls, we had happy customers raving online about their great experience.</p><p>If we hadn’t thought through installation with the same care and attention that we lavished on the thermostat, it would never have occurred to us to put a screwdriver in every box.</p><p>And if we hadn’t thought about the full customer life cycle—from discovery to support to loyalty—we would have just made the kind of tiny, one-use screwdriver that comes with IKEA furniture. Instead we included four heads—more than anyone needed to install the thermostat—so that people could use it for practically anything. So that Nest stayed in their brains as long as the screwdriver stayed in their drawer. Longer.</p><p>When a company gives that kind of care and attention to every part of the journey, people notice. Our product was good, but ultimately it was the whole journey that defined our brand. That’s what made Nest special. It’s what makes Apple special. It’s what allows businesses to reach beyond their product and create a connection—not with users and consumers, but with human beings. It’s how you create something that people will love.</p><p>Chapter 3.2
Why Storytelling
Every product should have a story, a narrative that explains why it needs to exist and how it will solve your customer’s problems. A good product story has three elements:</p><p>»  It appeals to people’s rational and emotional sides.</p><p>»  It takes complicated concepts and makes them simple.</p><p>» It reminds people of the problem that’s being solved—it focuses on the “why.”</p><p>That “why” is the most critical part of product development—it has to come first. Once you have a strong answer for why your product is needed, then you can focus on how it works. Just don’t forget that anyone encountering your product for the first time won’t have the context you have. You can’t just hit customers on the head with the “what” before you tell them the “why.”</p><p>And keep in mind that customers aren’t the only ones who will hear this story. Telling the story is how you attract people to your team or investors to your company. It’s what your salesperson puts in their slide deck and what you put in your board presentation.</p><p>The story of your product, your company, and your vision should drive everything you do.*</p><hr><p>I remember sitting in the stands watching Steve Jobs tell the world about the iPhone in 2007.</p><p>This is the day I’ve been looking forward to for two and a half years.</p><p>Every once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything and Apple has been—well, first of all, one’s very fortunate if you get to work on just one of these in your career. Apple has been very fortunate. It’s been able to introduce a few of these into the world.</p><p>In 1984 we introduced the Macintosh. It didn’t just change Apple. It changed the whole computer industry.</p><p>In 2001, we introduced the first iPod. And it didn’t just change the way we all listen to music, it changed the entire music industry.</p><p>Well, today we’re introducing three revolutionary products of this class. The first one is a widescreen iPod with touch controls. The second is a revolutionary mobile phone. And the third is a breakthrough internet communications device.</p><p>So, three things: a widescreen iPod with touch controls; a revolutionary mobile phone; and a breakthrough internet communications device. An iPod, a phone, and an internet communicator. An iPod, a phone . . . are you getting it? These are not three separate devices, this is one device, and we are calling it iPhone. Today, Apple is going to reinvent the phone, and here it is.</p><p>That’s the part of the speech that everyone remembers. The buildup and surprise, the brilliant setup. People still write articles about it. They celebrated its ten-year anniversary.</p><p>But the rest of the speech was just as important. After the setup, he reminded the audience of the problem Apple was solving for them. “The most advanced phones are called smartphones, so they say. And the problem is that they’re not so smart and they’re not so easy to use.” He talked for a while about regular mobile phones and smartphones and the problems of each before he dove into the features of the new iPhone.</p><p>He used a technique I later came to call the virus of doubt. It’s a way to get into people’s heads, remind them about a daily frustration, get them annoyed about it all over again. If you can infect them with the virus of doubt—“Maybe my experience isn’t as good as I thought, maybe it could be better”—then you prime them for your solution. You get them angry about how it works now so they can get excited about a new way of doing things.</p><p>Steve was a master of this. Before he told you what a product did, he always took the time to explain why you needed it. And he made it all look so natural, so easy.</p><p>I’d watched other CEOs give pitches before, they’d hardly know what their supposedly revolutionary product was. Sometimes they didn’t even know how to hold it right. But customers and the press would always be in awe of Steve’s presentations. “It’s a miracle,” they said. “He’s so calm, so collected. No prepared speeches, slides with almost no words—he just knows what he’s talking about and it all hangs together.”</p><p>It never felt like a speech. It felt like a conversation. Like a story.</p><p>And the reason is simple: Steve didn’t just read a script for the presentation. He’d been telling a version of that same story every single day for months and months during development—to us, to his friends, his family. He was constantly working on it, refining it. Every time he’d get a puzzled look or a request for clarification from his unwitting early audience, he’d sand it down, tweak it slightly, until it was perfectly polished.</p><p>It was the story of the product. And it drove what we built.</p><p>If part of the story didn’t work, then part of the product wasn’t going to work, either, and would need to be changed. That’s ultimately why the iPhone had a glass front face instead of plastic and why it didn’t have a hardware keyboard. Because the story of the “Jesus Phone” wouldn’t hold together if it got scratched the first time you put it in your pocket or if you’d be forced to watch movies on a tiny little screen. We were telling the story of a phone that would change everything. So that’s what we had to build.</p><p>And when I say “story,” I don’t just mean words.</p><p>Your product’s story is its design, its features, images and videos, quotes from customers, tips from reviewers, conversations with support agents. It’s the sum of what people see and feel about this thing that you’ve created.</p><p>And the story doesn’t just exist to sell your product. It’s there to help you define it, understand it, and understand your customers. It’s what you say to investors to convince them to give you money, and to new employees to convince them to join your team, and to partners to convince them to work with you, and to the press to convince them to care. And then, eventually, it’s what you tell customers to convince them to want what you’re selling.</p><p>And it all starts with “why.”</p><p>Why does this thing need to exist? Why does it matter? Why will people need it? Why will they love it?</p><p>To find that “why,” you need to understand the core of the problem you’re trying to solve, the real issue your customers face on a regular basis. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 4.1: How to Spot a Great Idea: The best ideas are painkillers, not vitamins.]</p><p>And you have to hold on to that “why” even as you build the “what”—the features, the innovation, the answer to all your customers’ problems. Because the longer you work on something, the more the “what” takes over—the “why” becomes so obvious, a feeling in your gut, a part of everything you do, that you don’t even need to express it anymore. You forget how much it matters.</p><p>When you get wrapped up in the “what,” you get ahead of people. You think everyone can see what you see. But they don’t. They haven’t been working on it for weeks, months, years. So you need to pause and clearly articulate the “why” before you can convince anyone to care about the “what.”</p><p>That’s the case no matter what you make—even if you sell B2B payments software. Even if you build deep-tech solutions for customers who don’t exist yet. Even if you sell lubricants to a factory that’s been buying the same thing for twenty years.</p><p>There’s a competition for market share and a competition for mind share. If your competitors are telling better stories than you, if they’re playing the game and you’re not, then it doesn’t matter if their product is worse. They will get the attention. To any customers, investors, partners, or talent doing a cursory search, they will appear to be the leaders in the category. The more people talk about them, the greater their mind share, and the more people will talk about them.</p><p>So you have to find an opportunity to craft stories that stick with customers and keep them talking about you. Even if your customer knows you and your product, or they’re highly technical, there are frictions that you can eliminate for them. You can explain why they need one version of lubricant over the other or give them information they never had before. Or you explain why buying the same product from your company is better than buying that product from a competitor. You can earn their trust by showing that you really know your stuff or understand their needs. Or offer them something useful; connect with them in a new way so they feel assured that they’re making the right choice with your company. You tell them a story they can connect with.</p><p>A good story is an act of empathy. It recognizes the needs of its audience. And it blends facts and feelings so the customer gets enough of both. First you need enough insights and concrete information that your argument doesn’t feel too floaty and insubstantial. It doesn’t have to be definitive data, but there has to be enough to feel meaty, to convince people that you’re anchored in real facts. But you can overdo it—if your story is only informational, then it’s entirely possible that people will agree with you but decide it’s not compelling enough to act on just yet. Maybe next month. Maybe next year.</p><p>So you have to appeal to their emotions—connect with something they care about. Their worries, their fears. Or show them a compelling vision of the future: give a human example. Walk through how a real person will experience this product—their day, their family, their work, the change they’ll experience. Just don’t lean so far into the emotional connection that what you’re arguing for feels novel, but not necessary.</p><p>There’s an art to telling a compelling story. But there’s also a science.</p><p>And always remember that your customers’ brains don’t always work like yours. Sometimes your rational argument will make an emotional connection. Sometimes your emotional story will give people the rational ammunition to buy your product. Certain Nest customers looked at the beautiful thermostat that we lovingly crafted to appeal to their heart and soul and said, “Sure, okay. It’s pretty” and then had a thrilled, emotional reaction to the potential of saving twenty-three dollars on their energy bill.</p><p>Every person is different. And everyone will read your story differently.</p><p>That’s why analogies can be such a useful tool in storytelling. They create a shorthand for complicated concepts—a bridge directly to a common experience.</p><p>That’s another thing I learned from Steve Jobs. He’d always say that analogies give customers superpowers. A great analogy allows a customer to instantly grasp a difficult feature and then describe that feature to others. That’s why “1,000 songs in your pocket” was so powerful. Everyone had CDs and tapes in bulky players that only let you listen to 10–15 songs, one album at a time. So “1,000 songs in your pocket” was an incredible contrast—it let people visualize this intangible thing—all the music they loved all together in one place, easy to find, easy to hold—and gave them a way to tell their friends and family why this new iPod thing was so cool.</p><p>Everything at Nest was steeped in analogies. They filled our website and our videos and our ads and even our support articles, our installation guides. They had to. Because to truly understand many of the features of our products, you’d need a deep well of knowledge about HVAC systems and power grids and the way smoke refracts through a laser to detect fire—knowledge almost nobody had. So we cheated. We didn’t try to explain everything. We just used an analogy.</p><p>I remember there was one complex feature that was designed to lighten the load on power plants on the hottest or coldest days of the year when everyone cranked up the heat or AC at once. It usually came down to just a few hours in the afternoon, a few days a year—one or more coal power plants would be brought on line to avoid blackouts. So we designed a feature that predicted when these moments would come, then the Nest Thermostat would crank the AC or heat up extra before the crucial peak hours and turn it down when everyone else was turning it up. Anyone who signed up for the program got a credit on their energy bill. As more and more people joined the program, the result was a win-win—people stayed comfortable, they saved money, and the energy companies didn’t have to turn on their dirtiest plants.</p><p>And that is all well and good, but it just took me 150 words to explain. So after countless hours of thinking about it and trying all the possible solutions, we settled on doing it in three: Rush Hour Rewards.</p><p>Everyone understands the concept of a rush hour—the moment when way too many people get on the road together and traffic slows to a creep. Same thing happens with energy. We didn’t need to explain much more than that—rush hours are a problem, but when there’s an energy rush hour, you can get something out of it. You can get a reward. You can actually save money rather than getting stuck with everyone else.</p><p>We made a whole webpage about it with a car graphic and little power plants puffing away. We probably belabored the point and stretched the metaphor—but we knew most people wouldn’t dig in that far.</p><p>For the vast majority of customers, we made it simple. With three words and one analogy we helped people get it—when there’s an energy rush hour, your Nest Thermostat can save you money.</p><p>It’s a story. A very quick one, but that’s the best kind.</p><p>Quick stories are easy to remember. And, more importantly, easy to repeat. Someone else telling your story will always reach more people and do more to convince them to buy your product than any amount of talking you do about yourself on your own platforms. You should always be striving to tell a story so good that it stops being yours—so your customer learns it, loves it, internalizes it, owns it. And tells it to everyone they know.</p><p>Chapter 3.3
Evolution Versus Disruption Versus Execution
Evolution: A small, incremental step to make something better.</p><p>Disruption: A fork on the evolutionary tree—something fundamentally new that changes the status quo, usually by taking a novel or revolutionary approach to an old problem.</p><p>Execution: Actually doing what you’ve promised to do and doing it well.</p><p>Your version one (V1) product should be disruptive, not evolutionary. But disruption alone will not guarantee success—you can’t ignore the fundamentals of execution because you think all you need is a brilliant disruption. And even if you do execute your idea well, it may not be enough. If you’re revolutionizing a major, dug-in industry, you may also need to disrupt marketing or channel or manufacturing or logistics or the business model or something else that never occurred to you.</p><p>Assuming V1 was at least a critical success, the second version of your product is typically an evolution of your first. Refine what you made in V1 using data and insights from actual customers and double down on your original disruption. The execution should step up a notch—now you know what you’re doing and should be able to provide a significantly more functional product.</p><p>You can continue evolving that product for a while, but always seek out new ways to disrupt yourself. You can’t only start thinking about it when the competition threatens to catch up or your business begins to stagnate.</p><hr><p>If you’re going to pour your heart into creating something new, then that thing should be disruptive. It should be bold. It should change something. It doesn’t have to be a product—Amazon was a disruptive service long before they got into making their own hardware. You can disrupt how things are sold, delivered, serviced, financed. You can disrupt how they’re marketed or recycled.</p><p>Disruption should be important for you personally—who doesn’t want to do something exciting and meaningful?—but it’s also important for the health of your business. If you’ve truly made something disruptive, your competition probably won’t be able to replicate it quickly.</p><p>The key is to find the right balance—not so disruptive that you won’t be able to execute, not so easy to execute that nobody will care. You have to choose your battles.</p><p>Just make sure you have battles.</p><p>If you undershoot—if you create something that’s only evolutionary, just another step down a well-trod path—then when you pitch it to the smartest people you know across a range of disciplines, they’ll just shrug. “Eh. Okay.”</p><p>There’ll be an almost audible fizzle.</p><p>You need something that will make them stop in their tracks and say, “Wow. Tell me more.” Whatever you’re disrupting is going to be the thing that defines your product—the thing that will make people take notice.</p><p>And it will be the thing that will make them laugh. If you’re disrupting big, entrenched industries, your competition will almost certainly dismiss you in the beginning. They’ll say that what you’re making is a plaything, not a threat. They’ll flat out laugh in your face.</p><p>Sony laughed at the iPod. Nokia laughed at the iPhone. Honeywell laughed at the Nest Learning Thermostat.</p><p>At first.</p><p>In the stages of grief, this is what we call Denial.</p><p>But soon, as your disruptive product, process, or business model begins to gain steam with customers, your competitors will start to get worried. They’ll start paying attention. And when they realize you might steal their market share, they’ll get pissed. Really pissed. When people hit the Anger stage of grief, they lash out, punch something. When companies get angry they undercut your pricing, try to embarrass you with advertising, use negative press to undermine you, put in new agreements with sales channels to lock you out of the market.</p><p>And they might sue you. If they can’t innovate, they litigate.</p><p>The good news is that a lawsuit means you’ve officially arrived. We had a party the day Honeywell sued Nest. We were thrilled. That ridiculous lawsuit (they sued our thermostat for being round) meant we were a real threat and they knew it. So we brought out the champagne. That’s right, fuckers. We’re coming for your lunch.</p><p>We had no intention of folding. We knew that for decades Honeywell had been suing little innovative companies out of business. They’d put a noose around their necks until the upstarts had no choice but to sell to Honeywell for a pittance. Any threat was quickly stamped out. But Nest’s general counsel, Chip Lutton, and I had been through these wars together from the Apple days and were not about to get spooked into settling. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 5.7: Lawyer Up: The first time I had to deal with a lawsuit.]</p><p>If your company is disruptive, you have to be prepared for strong reactions and stronger emotions. Some people will absolutely love what you’ve made. Some people will violently, relentlessly hate it. That’s the danger with disruption. It is not welcome by everyone. Disruption makes enemies.</p><p>Even starting something new in a big company won’t protect you. You’ll have to deal with politics, jealousy, and fear. You’re trying to change things, and change is scary, especially to people who think they’ve mastered their domain and who are completely unprepared for the ground to shift under their feet.</p><p>All it takes to start a landslide is one big scary new thing. Maybe two.</p><p>Just don’t overshoot. Don’t try to disrupt everything at once. Don’t make the Amazon Fire Phone.</p><p>I remember when Jeff Bezos first mentioned the idea. We were having a breakfast meeting about me potentially joining Amazon’s board. Jeff hinted at plans for making a new line of Amazon-branded devices, in particular a phone. It would be spectacularly disruptive: everything would look 3-D, it would let you X-ray any media, you could scan anything in the world and then buy it on Amazon. It would change everything.</p><p>I told him he’d already disrupted hardware—with the Kindle. It was wonderfully innovative and had a unique platform that nobody could duplicate. To get Amazon onto people’s phones and change how people shopped online, you didn’t need to build a whole new device. You just needed a really great app that would live on everybody else’s devices.</p><p>I told him: I wouldn’t make the phone.</p><p>He made the phone.</p><p>I didn’t get the board seat.</p><p>When it launched, the Fire Phone did everything he had promised—but none of it well. They tried to do too much, change too much. So the disruptions turned into gimmicks, and the project failed. It was a hard, painful lesson that they haven’t made again. Do. Fail. Learn.</p><p>But that’s the tricky thing with disruptions—they’re an extremely delicate balancing act. When they fall apart it’s usually for one of three reasons:</p><p>You focus on making one amazing thing but forget that it has to be part of a single, fluid experience. <!-- -->[See also: Figure 3.1.1, in Chapter 3.1.]<!-- --> So you ignore the million little details that aren’t as exciting to build—especially for V1—and end up with a neat little demo that doesn’t actually fit into anyone’s life.
Conversely, you start with a disruptive vision but set it aside because the technology is too difficult or too costly or doesn’t work well enough. So you execute beautifully on everything else but the one thing that would have differentiated your product withers away.
Or you change too many things too fast and regular people can’t recognize or understand what you’ve made. That’s one of the (many) issues that befell Google Glass. The look, the technology—it was all so new that people had no idea what to do with it. There was no intuitive understanding of what the thing was for. It’s as if Tesla decided out the gate to build electric cars with five wheels and two steering wheels. You can change the motor, change the dash—but it still has to look like a car. You can’t push people too far outside their mental model. Not at first.
That third reason explains why the first-generation iPod didn’t have the iTunes music store. There was no music marketplace, the term “podcast” was months away, and users just ripped their CDs with iTunes or pirated them online.</p><p>And it’s not because we didn’t think of it. We dreamed about various iTunes features while we were building the iPod. But we didn’t have time to execute it and we’d already disrupted enough. We needed to get people from CDs to MP3s—that was a big leap already. We’d only be successful if they had time to catch their balance before we asked them to jump again.</p><p>As we started working on V2 and V3, adding a digital marketplace became the logical next step. We were maximizing and capitalizing on our initial disruption. There was plenty of low-hanging fruit, so we just kept refining, evolving. V4, V5, V6.</p><p>The more we evolved, the more we wanted to change. At one point we came to Steve with radically new designs that we were really excited about—they were smaller and lighter, innovative and beautiful. And we’d removed the click wheel. He looked at them and said, “They’re great. But you’ve lost what it means to be an iPod.”</p><p>The world saw the click wheel and thought “iPod.” So removing it wasn’t an evolution—it was a disruption that made no sense at that moment. If we’d followed through we’d have made a smaller, lighter music player and diminished our own brand.</p><p>Lesson learned.</p><p>When you’re evolving you need to understand the quintessential things that define your product. What’s key to your feature set and your branding? What have you trained the customer to look for? With the iPod it was the click wheel. With the Nest Learning Thermostat it was the round, clean screen with a big temperature in the middle.</p><p>To maintain the core of your product there are usually one or two things that have to stay still while everything else spins and changes around them.</p><p>And that’s a useful constraint. You need some constraints to force you to dig deep and get creative, to push envelopes you hadn’t thought to open before.</p><p>At Apple we pushed ourselves nonstop. We knew that we needed to launch a new, significantly improved iPod every single year, ready to be gifted for the holidays. This was the first time Apple had set that kind of pace, since Mac products were always driven around computer processor upgrades from our suppliers. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 3.5: Heartbeats and Handcuffs: For a long time Macintoshes were at the whim of IBM.]<!-- --> But in our heads we heard the sound of Sony and our other competitors stalking us. We were in the lead but we had to keep evolving and executing pristinely to stay that way. Each year’s iPod had to be substantively better than last year’s model—either the hardware or software or both. We needed to keep the competition at bay and give customers a reason to upgrade.</p><p>So we learned to underpromise and overdeliver. We’d be conservative about key features like battery life—all through development we’d make sure we’d reached a number that Steve was satisfied with. Thirteen hours, fourteen hours. But behind the scenes, we’d steadily try to improve it—to claw back a minute here, a minute there.</p><p>Then we’d launch the latest iPod with the latest specs: fourteen hours of battery life.</p><p>Reviewers would get their hands on the new iPod and not only would it deliver, it would overdeliver. It would run hours longer than they expected.</p><p>We did it over and over, year after year, but somehow nobody caught on. Every time was a surprise. A delight. And that did just as much to cement Apple’s reputation for excellence as the iPod’s design and user experience.</p><p>That relentless march did a lot to define the iPod brand and keep people’s attention on Apple. And it depressed the hell out of our competition. I had friends at Philips who told me that every time they’d think of a great idea for how to outmaneuver the iPod, we’d come out with a similar feature a few months later and they’d have to go back to the drawing board. It crushed their spirits. We were moving so fast that by the time they caught up they were already behind.</p><p>But you can only evolve for so long.</p><p>Eventually the competition started closing in. The iPod had blown every other MP3 player out of the water, we had over 85 percent worldwide market share—but ultracompetitive cell phone manufacturers began figuring out how to get a piece of our pie. They started putting MP3s onto their phones, seeing the potential of getting everything into one device: calls, texts, the snake game, and music.</p><p>At the same time, the world was adopting cell phones like crazy and data networks were becoming dramatically better, faster, and cheaper. It was obvious that soon enough most people would be able to stream music instead of downloading it. That would change everything for the iPod business.</p><p>So either the landscape was going to change under our feet, or we were going to change the landscape.</p><p>We had to disrupt ourselves.</p><p>The iPod was Apple’s only successful new non-Mac product in fifteen years. At times it accounted for more than 50 percent of Apple’s revenue. It was hugely popular and still growing fast. It defined the company for millions of non-Mac customers.</p><p>But we decided to eat our own. We had to make the iPhone, even though we knew it could, probably would, kill the iPod.</p><p>It was an enormous risk. But with any disruption, the competition only wallows in Denial and Anger for so long. Eventually they reach Acceptance, and if they’ve got any life left in them, they’ll start working furiously to catch up to you. Or you may inspire a whole new wave of companies who can use your initial disruption as a stepping-stone to leapfrog you.</p><p>When you can see the competition nipping at your heels, you have to do something new. You have to fundamentally change who you are as a business. You have to keep moving.</p><p>You cannot be afraid to disrupt the thing that made you successful in the first place. Even if it made you hugely successful. Look at Kodak. Look at Nokia. Companies that become too big, too comfortable, too obsessed with preserving and protecting that first big innovation that put them on the map—they topple. They unravel. They die.</p><p>If you’re experiencing your biggest market share ever, that means you’re on the brink of becoming calcified and stagnant. It’s time to dig deep and kick your own ass. Google, Facebook, all the tech giants are due for a disruption any day now—or they’ll be forced into it by regulation.</p><p>Tesla could have fallen into the same trap. They started with one huge disruption—revolutionizing the auto industry, making EV cars attractive to consumers for the first time. But as every carmaker in the world followed their lead, Tesla was in danger of becoming just one more electric car in a market flooded by them. So they started electrifying different kinds of vehicles and innovating charging networks and retail and service, batteries and supply chains. They’re ensuring that the competition has to fully disrupt every part of their operations to even enter the race. Once every carmaker has an electric vehicle, then the customer will focus on all these other aspects that Tesla has already disrupted and brought to market.</p><p>Competition is a given, both direct and indirect. Someone is always watching, trying to exploit any crack in a more successful competitor.</p><p>For years Microsoft’s primary source of revenue was selling Windows to giant corporations. It was a sales-driven culture, not product-driven. So the product didn’t change much, year after year, long after the internet was born and started to change everything else. Long after it was clear Microsoft’s business model was dying. Long after the company culture sank into a deep malaise and the industry dismissed them as a dinosaur.</p><p>But eventually, after years of flailing, the new CEO, Satya Nadella, shook up their culture and forced them to look at other products and business models. They branched out. And they had plenty of false starts—plenty of failed products. Many branches broke—but several bore fruit: the Surface products, Azure cloud computing. They stopped looking to Windows to be the cash cow and turned Office into an online subscription. They climbed out of their hole, their stagnant swamp, and now Microsoft is back to making innovative imagination-grabbing products again, like Hololens and their Surface products.</p><p>Of course, most founders would kill to start a business that gets so large that it’s at risk of stagnation. Almost nobody gets that far.</p><p>Most people stall out at the first step—the first disruption. It’s easy to say “change something meaningful,” and infinitely harder to come up with a great idea and execute it in a way that connects with customers. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 4.1: How to Spot a Great Idea.]</p><p>Especially because one amazing disruption may not be enough. You may have to disrupt things you never even thought of.</p><p>If Nest had only disrupted hardware—if we had just built the Nest Learning Thermostat alone—we would have failed. Utterly.</p><p>We needed to disrupt the sales and distribution channel, too.</p><p>At the time, regular people didn’t really go out and buy thermostats. You could get them at a hardware store, but they were intentionally complicated so you couldn’t install them easily yourself. And they weren’t sold online so you couldn’t comparison shop and see the steep markup HVAC technicians would charge you. So if your thermostat broke, you’d just call a technician to replace it. And if your heater or AC conked out you’d be upsold a new thermostat, too (whether you needed it or not).</p><p>For every upsell of a fancy new Honeywell thermostat, the HVAC technician would get a nice little bonus for a job well done. Sell enough thermostats and Honeywell would send you on a Hawaiian vacation.</p><p>This was an entrenched market where the existing players had done everything in their power to keep out competitors. There was no incentive for HVAC technicians to sell or install Nest Learning Thermostats. We weren’t giving out bonuses—in fact they’d make less money selling our devices than the old ones. And we definitely weren’t going to send anyone to Hawaii. We were a tiny company and Honeywell had bought the installers’ loyalty for decades.</p><p>So we had to go completely around the existing channel. We had to create a new market: selling directly to homeowners in a world where homeowners did not buy thermostats. And we had to sell in places where thermostats had never been sold before. Our first retail partner was Best Buy, and they had no idea where to put Nest. It’s not like they had a thermostat aisle.</p><p>But I made sure we were not going to repeat the mistakes of Philips. We weren’t going to let Nest get shoved behind a stereo in a storeroom somewhere. So we told Best Buy that we didn’t want a thermostat aisle—we wanted a Connected Home aisle. Of course they didn’t have that, either. So we invented it together.</p><p>I didn’t get into the thermostat business to disrupt Best Buy. But that’s what we had to do to sell thermostats.</p><p>If you do it right, one disruption will fuel the next. One revolution will domino into another. People will laugh at you and tell you it’s ludicrous, but that just means they’re starting to pay attention. You’ve found something worth doing. Keep doing it.</p><p>Chapter 3.4
Your First Adventure—and Your Second
When you’re leading a team or project to launch V1—the first version of a product that’s new for you and your team—it’s like heading out into the mountains with friends for the first time. You think you have everything you need to camp and climb, but you’ve never done it before. So you’re tentative. And you’re slow. But you take your best guess at what you need and where you’re going and head into the wild.</p><p>The next year, you decide to do it again. This time it’s V2. And it’s completely different—you know where you’re going, you know what it takes to get there, and you know your team. You now have the confidence to be bolder, take bigger risks, to go further than you ever thought before.</p><p>But on that very first journey, you won’t have those advantages. You’ll need to make many opinion-driven decisions without the benefit of data or experience to guide you. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 2.2: Data Versus Opinion.]</p><p>The tools you need to make those decisions are below, organized by order of importance:</p><ol><li><p>Vision: Know what you want to make, why you’re making it, who it’s for, and why people will buy it. You’ll need a strong leader or a small group to ensure the vision is delivered intact.</p></li><li><p>Customer insights: This is what you’ve learned through customer or market research or simply by thinking like your customer: what they like, what they dislike, what problems they experience on a regular basis, and what solutions they’ll respond to.</p></li><li><p>Data: For any really new product, reliable data will be limited or nonexistent. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t make a reasonable attempt to gather objective information—the scope of the opportunity, the way people use current solutions, etc. But this information will never be definitive. It won’t make your decisions for you.</p></li></ol><p>Once you start iterating on an existing product, V2, your second adventure, you’ll have experience and customers and the luxury of plenty of data-driven decisions. However, a myopic focus on numbers can slow you down or lead you off-track. So you’ll still need all the same tools as above, just in a different order.</p><ol><li><p>Data: You’ll be able to track how customers use your current product and test new versions. You can confirm or disprove hunches with hard data from actual paying customers. This data will allow you to fix the stuff you screwed up when you were just following your gut.</p></li><li><p>Customer insights: Once people have committed to paying money for your product, they’re much more reliable for useful insights. They can tell you what’s broken and what they want to see next.</p></li><li><p>Vision: Assuming you got 1.0 more or less right, that original vision moves behind the data and insights you can get from actual customers. But your original vision should not be set aside entirely as you iterate. You should always keep in mind your longer-term goals and mission so that your product’s fundamental purpose doesn’t get lost.</p></li></ol><p>You should also keep in mind that you’re not just making V1 or V2 of your product—you’re building out the first or second version of your team and processes.</p><p>V1 team: It’s mostly or all new players working together. You’re still feeling each other out, trying to understand if you can trust each other and who will stick around when things get hard. You’ll need to agree on a singular process, which is often harder than agreeing on a product. People will disagree based on past experiences and trust can quickly break down. The risk of making something new is always compounded by not having confidence in the team.</p><p>V2 team: You may have to upgrade parts of your team as you become more ambitious, but many of the same teammates who weathered the storm of V1 will be ready to enter the fray again for V2. You’ll hopefully trust each other, have already settled into a development process that works, and you’ll have a shorthand that speeds everything up. This confidence in each other will allow you to take bigger risks and build more exciting products.</p><hr><p>The marketing team fought Steve Jobs the hardest about the iPhone keyboard. But a lot of us rebelled. In 2005 the most popular “smart” phone by far was the BlackBerry—fondly known as the Crackberry. People were addicted. BlackBerry owned 25 percent of the market and was growing fast. And the BlackBerry die-hards would always tell you that the very best thing about their very favorite gadget was obvious. It was the keyboard.</p><p>image
Fig. 3.4.1</p><p>Behold, the Blackberry—lovingly known as the Crackberry to its disciples. This is the Blackberry 7290, released in 2004. It had web browsing and email, a backlit QWERTY keyboard, and a black-and-white display that could show a whopping fifteen lines of text.</p><p>Dwight Eschliman</p><p>It was built like a tank. It took a couple of weeks to get used to, but after that you could text and email incredibly fast. It felt good under your thumbs. Solid.</p><p>So when Steve told the team his vision for Apple’s first phone—one giant touchscreen, no hardware keyboard—there was an almost audible gasp. People whispered in the hallways, “Are we really going to make a keyboardless phone?”</p><p>Touchscreen keyboards sucked. Everyone knew they sucked. I really knew they sucked. I’d built them twice—first at General Magic and then at Philips. You’d have to use a stylus, tap-tap-tapping away at a screen with no give, no feedback, slipping and sliding, frustratingly slow. It just never felt natural. So I was skeptical that the technology existed to make a touchscreen live up to our expectations. There hadn’t been many technical breakthroughs in the area since I started working on it in 1991. The biggest was Palm’s Graffiti, which forced you to write in hieroglyphic shorthand so a computer could actually understand it.</p><p>The marketing team was less worried about technology and more worried about sales. They knew people wanted hardware keyboards. After a long period where BlackBerrys were only approved for salespeople at Apple, marketing had finally gotten their hands on them to see what the fuss was about. And they fell in love, too. So they were certain we weren’t going to be able to compete with existing smartphones without a hardware keyboard. Mobile professionals simply wouldn’t buy it—they were addicted to their Crackberries.</p><p>Steve wouldn’t budge.</p><p>The iPhone was going to be new. Completely different. And it wouldn’t be for mobile professionals. It was for regular people. But nobody could know how regular people would react because the consumer market had been completely untouched for a decade. When General Magic’s first-generation “smartphone” imploded, it sucked up the entire industry’s will to build personal devices for Joe Sixpack.</p><p>Most of the hardware manufacturers in the 1990s and early 2000s did what I did: they turned to business tools. Philips, Palm, BlackBerry. They all targeted businesspeople who mostly needed to write emails, send messages, and update docs. Not watch movies. Not listen to music. Not screw around on the internet or take pictures or connect with friends.</p><p>And the iPhone was going to be tiny—Apple didn’t want it much bigger than an iPod, so it could easily slip in and out of your pocket. Ultimately the screen measured 3.5 inches diagonally. And Steve wasn’t about to sacrifice half that space to a molded plastic keyboard that was impossible to change without literally going back to the drawing board.</p><p>image
Fig. 3.4.2</p><p>The original iPhone launched in 2007 was tiny—smaller than any iPhone you can get today. It was 4.53 x 2.40 inches, weighed 135 grams, and had a 3.5-inch screen. By comparison, the iPhone 13 mini measures 5.8 x 2.53 inches, weighs 141 grams, and boasts a 5.4-inch screen.</p><p>Dwight Eschliman</p><p>A hardware keyboard locks you into a hardware world. What if you want to write in French? Or Japanese? Or Arabic? What if you want emojis? What if you need to add a function or take one away? And what if you want to watch a video? There’s no turning a phone horizontally if it’s half keyboard.</p><p>image
Fig. 3.4.3</p><p>It’s easy to see Steve’s point when you compare the Blackberry Curve 8310 (released in August 2007) to the original iPhone (released in June 2007). The Blackberry’s screen was only 2.5 inches. Its keyboard was so robust that almost no screen remained.</p><p>Dwight Eschliman</p><p>I agreed with Steve. In principle. I just didn’t think we could pull it off with any of the technology I’d seen to date. I needed enough data to know that I could make his vision a reality. So to get comfortable and stop arguing opinions, we set down weekly challenges to the hardware and software teams to create a better demo. How fast could we get it? What was the error rate? The keys were going to be smaller than your fingers, so errors were inevitable. How were we going to get around those errors and correct them? And at what speed? When was each key activated—when you put your finger down or when you lifted it up? How was it going to sound? We needed audio feedback if you couldn’t get force feedback. And then there was the qualitative test: Did it feel good? Did I want to use it? Did it drive me crazy? We had to change the algorithms at all levels of the system many, many, many times.</p><p>After eight weeks it was far from perfect, but it was getting there. Considering how much we’d improved in just a couple of months, I decided that, though it wouldn’t be as good as a hardware keyboard, it would be just good enough. I convinced myself.</p><p>But marketing wasn’t moved.</p><p>After weeks and weeks of argument, Steve put his foot down. There was no data that would definitively prove it would work. There was no data that would prove it wouldn’t. This was an opinion-driven decision and Steve’s opinion was the one that counted most. “So either get on board right now or you’re off the team,” Steve said. That settled it for marketing.</p><p>Of course, in the end Steve was proven right. The iPhone changed everything. And it was only possible because he stuck to his vision.</p><p>But that’s not to say that sticking to your vision will always lead to success.</p><p>Not even for Steve Jobs.</p><p>Most people don’t realize what the iPod was originally built for. Its purpose wasn’t just to play music—it was made to sell Macintosh computers. That’s what was in Steve Jobs’s head: We’re going to make something amazing that will only work with our Macs. People will love it so much that they’ll start buying Macs again.</p><p>At the time Apple was near death. It had almost no market share—even in the United States. But the iPod would solve that problem. It would save the company.</p><p>So as far as Steve Jobs was concerned, the iPod would never work with a PC. That would completely defeat the point—we needed to sell more computers</p><p>And that’s why the first generation of iPod fizzled.</p><p>The critics loved it. So did the people who already had Apple computers. Unfortunately, at that time there weren’t many of them. The iPod cost $399. The entry-level iMac cost $1,300. Even though the iPod was by far the best MP3 player on the market, nobody was going to drop $1,700 on the complete Apple package just to listen to Radiohead more easily.</p><p>But that didn’t stop us. The same day we introduced the first version, we had already started working on the second. V2 would be thinner, more powerful, more beautiful. We came to Steve and said it needed to work on PCs. It had to.</p><p>No.</p><p>Absolutely not.</p><p>Forcing Steve to abandon his original plan was almost impossible. But we waged an all-out war trying to prove to him that this wasn’t an opinion-driven decision anymore. This was data. We were in V2. We had real revenue and insights from actual paying customers (although not enough of either).</p><p>We were iterating. We were climbing the mountain again. It was time to put the vision third.</p><p>We managed to get him to consider a half measure for the second-generation iPod—adding the Musicmatch Jukebox (basically the leading iTunes competitor but on a PC), which let you transfer your music library from a Windows machine to the iPod. And even that was a struggle.</p><p>In the end, we agreed that we should ask Walt Mossberg, the famed tech reviewer, to cast the deciding vote (unbeknownst to Walt!). It was a setup, of course. I think Steve wanted someone to blame if it didn’t work.</p><p>Ultimately Steve was proven wrong. Allowing the iPod to work with PCs instantly buoyed sales. By the third generation we started selling tens of millions. Then hundreds of millions. That’s what turned things around for Apple. That’s what saved the company. Ironically, it’s even what saved the Mac—customers who loved the iPod started looking into Apple’s other products and Macintoshes started selling again.</p><p>But the lesson here isn’t that Steve Jobs was fallible. Of course he was. He was human.</p><p>The lesson is about when and how vision and data should guide your decisions. In the very beginning, before there are customers, vision is more important than pretty much anything else.</p><p>But you don’t have to figure out your vision all by yourself. In fact, you probably shouldn’t. Locking yourself alone in a room to create a manifesto of your single, luminous vision looks and feels indistinguishable from completely losing your mind. Get at least one person—but preferably a small group—to bounce ideas off of. Sketch out your mission together. Then fulfill it together.</p><p>In the end, you may create something magical and world-changing. But then again, you might not.</p><p>There’s always a chance that you valiantly clung to your vision for 1.0 in the face of all obstacles and the vision turned out to be wrong. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 3.6: Three Generations: The “chasm” is the hole companies can fall into.]<!-- --> Whatever you made just doesn’t work. Maybe there was a data-driven decision that you thought was an opinion. Maybe you just calculated wrong or timed it wrong or something changed in the macro environment that you couldn’t control.</p><p>At that point you have to go back and, as painful as it is, honestly and thoroughly analyze why you failed. This is the moment when you need to gather data. Your gut got you to this point, so find data to help you understand why your gut was wrong.</p><p>You may not come back from it. You may have run out of money, lost the team or your credibility. But the only way to move forward is to do an honest accounting of the past. Learn your lessons—especially the hard ones. Then try again. Back to the drawing board. V1.</p><p>Eventually your vision will improve. You’ll learn to trust your gut again. And you’ll get to the other side: V2. And that’s a very different story.</p><p>When you’re building the second version of your product, you can talk to actual customers and understand exactly what they think and what they want to see next. You can do all the stuff you desperately wanted to put into V1 but couldn’t. You can analyze the numbers, understand the costs and benefits. You can confirm your insights with information, A/B tests, charts, and figures. You can adjust and adapt to your customer’s needs and more and more decisions can be driven by glorious, simple, clear-cut, black-and-white data.</p><p>But before that moment comes you need to get through the sprint and the marathon of V1. You need people you trust to keep you going. And you’ll need to know when to stop.</p><p>If you wait for your product to be perfect, you will never finish. But it’s very hard to know when you’re done—when you need to stop building and just put it out into the world. When is it good enough? When are you close enough to your vision? When are the inevitable issues ignorable enough that you can live with them?</p><p>Typically your vision is so much greater than what materializes in V1. There’s always another revision, always something else you want to do, change, add, tweak. When do you tear yourself away from what you’re making and just . . . stop? Ship it. Set it free. See what happens.</p><p>Here’s the trick: write a press release.</p><p>But don’t write it when you’re done. Write it when you start.</p><p>I began doing this at Apple and eventually realized other leaders had figured it out, too (looking at you, Bezos). It’s an incredibly useful tool to narrow down what really matters.</p><p>To write a good press release you have to focus. The press release is meant to hook people—it’s how you get journalists interested in what you’re making. You have to catch their attention. You have to be succinct and interesting, highlight the most important and essential things that your product can do. You can’t just list everything you want to make—you have to prioritize. When you write a press release you say, “Here. This. This is what’s newsworthy. This is what really matters.”</p><p>So spend some time developing as great a press release as you can. Consult with marketing and PR people if you have to. They’ll help you trim it down to the essentials.</p><p>Then weeks or months or years later, as you’re getting close to finishing, as you’re debating what makes it in, what gets cut, what matters, what doesn’t—take out your press release. Read it.</p><p>If you launched right now, could you more or less send that press release into the world and have it be mostly true? If the answer is yes, then congratulations: your product is probably ready, or at least pretty close. You have achieved the core of your vision. Everything else is most likely a “nice to have,” not a priority.</p><p>Of course, there’s a chance that since you started, you’ve had to pivot so much that the original press release is laughably off-base. Sometimes that happens.</p><p>No problem. Write another press release. Rinse. Repeat.</p><p>This is an adventure and adventures never go according to plan. That’s what makes them fun. And scary. And worth doing. That’s why you take a deep breath, surround yourself with great people, and head out into the wilderness.</p><p>Chapter 3.5
Heartbeats and Handcuffs
You need constraints to make good decisions and the best constraint in the world is time. When you’re handcuffed to a hard deadline, you can’t keep trying this and that, changing your mind, putting the finishing touches on something that will never be finished.</p><p>When you handcuff yourself to a deadline—ideally an external, immovable date like Christmas or a big conference—you have to execute and get creative to finish on time. The external heartbeat, the constraint, drives the creativity, which fuels the innovation.</p><p>Before you launch V1, your external deadline is always a little wobbly. There are too many unknown unknowns to write it in stone. So the way you keep everyone moving is by creating strong internal deadlines—heartbeats that your team sets their calendar to:</p><ol><li><p>Team heartbeats: Each individual team makes its own rhythm and deadlines for delivering their piece of the puzzle. Then all the teams align for . . .</p></li><li><p>Project heartbeats: These are the moments when different teams sync to make sure the product still makes sense and all the pieces are moving at the right pace.</p></li></ol><p>image
Fig. 3.5.1</p><p>Each team has its own rhythm, based on its style, the work it performs, and the needs of the project. Different teams will come together at milestones driven by the project heartbeat, which is primarily driven by the external heartbeat. The best external heartbeats aren’t set by the company but by outside forces—like the holidays or a big conference. A steady project heartbeat is required to make sure the team doesn’t miss any of those critical external deadlines.</p><p>Matteo Vianello</p><hr><p>When I joined General Magic, the plan was to ship in nine months. Then the launch got delayed by six months. And another six months. And another. It kept going like that for four years.</p><p>Possibly the only reason we shipped at all was that Apple launched the Newton and investors started putting the pressure on. That’s when we encountered our very first constraint: the competition closing in.</p><p>The Magic Link only launched when it had to launch. We only started making hard decisions—this stays, this gets cut, this is good enough, this isn’t—when we had no other choice. We couldn’t spin endlessly anymore, trying to reach perfection. General Magic was flailing and needed a pair of handcuffs. It needed to set a date for launch and hold to it.</p><p>But that’s always the crisis of V1: when do you launch? You don’t have any customers, you haven’t really told the world what you’re working on. It’s all too easy to just keep working.</p><p>So you have to force yourself to stop. Construct a deadline and handcuff yourself to it.</p><p>For the first version of the iPhone, we gave ourselves ten weeks.</p><p>Ten weeks to see if we could make it work. If we could get to the minimal version that would prove that this was the right direction to pursue.</p><p>Our initial concept was an iPod + phone: keep the click wheel, change everything around it. Within three weeks, we could see it was a nonstarter. The click wheel was the main design element but we couldn’t make it into a dial without turning the whole thing into a rotary phone.</p><p>The initial hypothesis—that we could repurpose the iPod’s iconic design and hardware—proved incorrect. So we hit reset. New hypothesis. This time we would start from scratch, so we gave ourselves five months.</p><p>The second concept had the basic shape and industrial design of an iPod Mini but with a full face screen and no click wheel—very similar to what we see today.</p><p>We ran into a slew of new problems with that second iPhone prototype design—we couldn’t get the engineering right. The antennas, the GPS, the cameras, the thermals. We’d never built a mobile phone before, let alone a smartphone, and our assumptions were flawed. Again.</p><p>Reset. Start over.</p><p>image
Fig. 3.5.2</p><p>This iPod-phone model wasn’t actually one of ours—it arrived from a manufacturer who’d heard rumors that we were working on a phone and wanted to pitch us their idea. This odd-looking device shows the impossibility of designing a phone around the click wheel. The top half would swivel around 180 degrees so you could use the screen if you were dialing a phone number or texting—not a bad idea, actually, but it’s not an iPhone.</p><p>Dwight Eschliman</p><p>It was only with the third version that we understood all the pieces well enough to create the right V1 device.</p><p>But we would have never reached that third design if we hadn’t given ourselves hard deadlines with the first two—if we hadn’t cut ourselves off after a few months, reset, and moved on.</p><p>We forced as many constraints on ourselves as possible: not too much time, not too much money, and not too many people on the team.</p><p>That last point is important.</p><p>image
Fig. 3.5.3</p><p>We spent a lot of time playing with various concepts, and these crazy plastic slabs were from some early form factor trials. They let us see how our ideas would feel in our hands, pockets, and purses as we tried to figure out what made sense and what didn’t.</p><p>Will Miller</p><p>Don’t go crazy hiring people just because you can. With most projects in the concepting stage, you can get a huge amount done with around ten people or even fewer. You don’t want to staff up and then be forced to design by committee or put a ton of people on the sidelines, sitting on their hands, waiting for you to figure it out.</p><p>By the end of the first iPhone project we had about eight hundred people working on it. But can you imagine what would have happened if all eight hundred had been with us from the beginning, watching us abandon the vision and restart the project? And then do it again a few months later? It would have been mayhem. Eight hundred people panicking and us endlessly reassuring everyone, focusing on the positive, trying to keep all those people in sync with a truly crazy number of iterations.</p><p>So keep your project small as long as you can. And don’t allocate too much money at the start. People do stupid things when they have a giant budget—they overdesign, they overthink. That inevitably leads to longer runways, longer schedules, and slower heartbeats. Much, much slower.</p><p>Generally any brand-new product should never take longer than 18 months to ship—24 at the limit. The sweet spot is somewhere between 9 and 18 months. That applies to hardware and software, atoms and bits. Of course, there are things that take longer—research can take decades, for example. But even if it takes ten years to research a question, regular check-ins along the way ensure you’re still chasing the right answer. Or still asking the right question.</p><p>Every project needs a heartbeat.</p><p>Pre-V1 launch, that heartbeat is entirely internal. You’re not talking to the outside world yet, so you have to have a strong internal rhythm that pushes you toward a set launch date.</p><p>This rhythm is made of major milestones—board meetings, all-hands meetings, or project milestones at certain moments of product development where everyone, engineering and marketing and sales and support, can pause and sync with each other. This might happen every few weeks or every few months, but it has to happen in order to keep everyone moving in lockstep to the external announcement.</p><p>And in order to keep the project heartbeat going, every team will need to produce its own deliverables at its own pace. Each team’s heartbeat will be different—it could be six-week sprints or weekly reviews or daily check-ins. It could be scrum or waterfall or kanban, whatever organizational framework or project management approach works for you. A creative team is going to have a very different heartbeat than an engineering team; a company that makes hardware is going to have slower team rhythms than companies that only push around electrons. It doesn’t matter what that heartbeat is, your job is to keep it steady so your team knows what’s expected of them.</p><p>I learned that at Philips, the first time I had to create a heartbeat from scratch.</p><p>When we started, the whole team was pretty young and inexperienced at project management, so we hired some consultants to help us build a schedule. They suggested we organize our tasks down to half days. The team would estimate how many half days it would take to complete each piece of the project and we’d break down all the months, weeks, and days necessary to do every task we could think of. Then we created detailed schedules 12–18 months into the future based on everyone’s individual workload.</p><p>It seemed perfectly sensible. We nodded in approval at the consultants. Great! We have a real schedule! We might actually pull this off! Until we realized that:</p><p>Nobody can accurately estimate their time or all the steps they’ll need to perform.
Trying to get into that much detail that far out is useless. Something will always spoil your plan.
We were spending all our time scheduling, arguing over what could and couldn’t be done in a half day, and it was impossible to see the whole forest through the half trees.
Whenever the product would shift and evolve, we’d scramble. We’d have to harass everybody to tell us how many half days it would take them to deal with the change, instead of just dealing with it. We’d spend hours every week to “work the schedule” with each member of the team instead of actually working.</p><p>After a few months, we scrapped the whole system. No more half days. We organized our time into bigger chunks—weeks, months. We started taking a macro view of our projects. And that enabled us to build the V1 of Velo in about eighteen months. Then we handed it, gleaming and new, to sales and marketing.</p><p>And they had absolutely no idea what to do with it. They’d never seen it before. They didn’t know how to sell it, where to sell it, how to advertise it. They had been an afterthought to us, and now we were an afterthought to them.</p><p>We had figured out our internal heartbeat, but had never synced it with any other team. Nobody else could keep up with our rhythm. We were dancing to our own beat, sure that all eyes were on us, and our dance partner was across the room getting punch, thinking about electric shavers.</p><p>We needed internal milestones within the project—regular check-ins where we would make sure everybody understood how the product had evolved and could evolve their side of the business along with it. And to make sure the product still made sense. To see if marketing still liked it. To see if sales still liked it. To see if support could still explain it. To make sure everyone knew what they were making and the plan to launch it.</p><p>Those milestones slow you down in the short term, but ultimately speed up all of product development. And they make for a better product.</p><p>And then, eventually, finally, one day you’ll be done. Or at least done enough. And you’ll reach your very first external heartbeat for V1.</p><p>Hopefully it goes well. Hopefully the world likes it. Hopefully they want more, so that first external heartbeat will be followed by another. And another.</p><p>Once you move past V1 and onto V2, the pace of your external announcements, and possibly your competitors, will begin to drive your internal heartbeats.</p><p>Just be careful.</p><p>If you’re building something digital—an app, a website, a piece of software—you can literally change your product at any time. You can add features every week. You can redesign the whole experience once a month. But just because you can, doesn’t mean you should.</p><p>Heartbeats shouldn’t be too fast. If a team is constantly updating their product, then customers start tuning out. They don’t have time to learn how the product works—certainly not to master it—before suddenly it’s new again.</p><p>Look at Google. Its heartbeat is erratic, unpredictable. It works for them—mostly, sometimes—but it could work so much better. Google arguably only has one big external heartbeat each year at Google I/O—and most teams don’t bother aligning with it. They typically launch whatever they want whenever they want throughout the year, sometimes with real marketing behind it, other times with simple email campaigns.</p><p>That means they can never communicate with their customers in a cohesive way about their entire organization. One team does this, another does that, their announcements either overlap or ignore obvious opportunities to create a narrative. And nobody, not customers, not even employees, can keep up.</p><p>You need natural pauses so people can catch up to you—so customers and reviewers can give you feedback that you can then integrate into the next version. And so your team can understand what the customer doesn’t.</p><p>But you also can’t slow down too much. The heartbeats of companies that work with atoms rather than electrons are often way too slow. Because atoms are scary: you can’t relaunch an atom.</p><p>The right process and timing is a balancing act—not too fast, not too slow.</p><p>So look at the year ahead.</p><p>After you’ve launched your V1, then two to four times in that year, you should be announcing something to the world. New products, new features, new redesigns or updates. Something meaty that’s worth people’s attention. It doesn’t matter if you’re a big or tiny company; if you’re building hardware or apps, B2B or B2C, this is the right rhythm for customers. For humans. Any more announcements or big changes and you’ll start confusing people, any fewer and they’ll start forgetting about you. So have at least one really big launch and another one to three smaller launches every year.</p><p>Apple’s external heartbeat used to thump loudest at the annual MacWorld conference in San Francisco. That event drove the pace of the whole company. The biggest announcements always had to happen at MacWorld.</p><p>And MacWorld always happened in January.</p><p>The main reason was that MacWorld organizers were cheap. The first week of the year was the least expensive time to rent conference space in San Francisco since tourists and businesspeople took a break from traveling after the holiday rush. And in any case, MacWorld was small. In the nineties Apple was floundering and its customer base was tiny, so the few die-hards who attended the show were Silicon Valley techies who were already in the neighborhood. The city of San Francisco was happy to keep the geeks coming in January and save more lucrative spring and summer slots for larger conferences that would attract more out-of-towners.</p><p>So January it was.</p><p>But that meant that every year, Apple couldn’t take time off over the holidays. Absolutely everything had to be done by January 1. If you worked on certain teams at Apple, your family just resigned themselves to never seeing you from Thanksgiving until the new year. Most teams would only reemerge after MacWorld, haggard but triumphant, squinting and rubbing their eyes in the sunlight. This went on for years and years and years.</p><p>Until, eventually, Steve Jobs said, “Screw this.”</p><p>He decided Apple was strong enough to skip MacWorld. He set a new heartbeat.</p><p>The old heartbeat had big announcements at MacWorld in January and smaller releases at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June and then again in September.</p><p>But the new heartbeat was smaller announcements in March, then a big blowout at WWDC in the summer, and more smaller announcements in the fall.</p><p>Now Apple has so much to talk about that there are announcements in March, June, September, and October, just before the holidays.</p><p>But not January. Never January. They learned that lesson well.</p><p>Unfortunately, you don’t always control your heartbeat. Sometimes it’s based around someone else’s conference. Sometimes it orbits someone else’s products.</p><p>For a long time Macintoshes were at the whim of IBM, Motorola, and Intel—the makers of their processors. If a new processor was delayed, then the new Macs would be delayed. That’s why Macintosh settled on Intel processors for so long—because they were the least unreliable of the lot. But even Intel wasn’t 100 percent predictable, and any slight change in their schedule caused endless scrambling and readjusting on the Apple side.</p><p>There was no way to create a steady heartbeat for Mac customers or a reasonable rhythm for the Apple team if they relied on Intel processors. So just as Steve decided to own his schedule for announcements, eventually he decided Apple needed to make its own processors.</p><p>That was the only way to make the world predictable.</p><p>And there’s nothing people like more than a predictable world.</p><p>We like to think that we’re not ruled by schedules, that we can throw off the chains of habit at any time—but most people are creatures of routine. They’re comforted by the knowledge of what comes next. They need it to plan their lives and their projects.</p><p>Predictability allows your team to know when they should be heads down working and when they should be looking up to check in with other teams or to make sure that they’re still headed in the right direction. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 1.4: Don’t (Only) Look Down.]</p><p>Predictability allows you to codify a product development process rather than starting from scratch every time. It allows you to create a living document with checkpoints, milestones, schedules, and plans that trains new employees and teaches everyone: This is how we do it. This is the framework for how to build a product.</p><p>Ultimately, that predictability is how you’ll actually make your deadline.</p><p>Breaking the rhythm of your external heartbeat should be avoided at all costs, but sometimes it’ll happen anyway. Something will break. Something will take longer than anyone expected. It almost always happens with V1, when you’re starting from scratch, trying to figure out everything at once.</p><p>But once you’ve got your process in place and can finally get V1 out the door, your heartbeat can settle down. It can get steady.</p><p>And when you ship V2, you’ll actually be on time. And everyone—your team, your customers, the press—will feel the rhythm.</p><p>Chapter 3.6
Three Generations
The joke is that it takes twenty years to make an overnight success. In business, it’s more like six to ten. It always takes longer than you think to find product/market fit, to get your customers’ attention, to build a complete solution, and then to make money. You typically need to create at least three generations of any new, disruptive product before you get it right and turn a profit. This is true for B2B and B2C, for companies that build with atoms or electrons or both, for brand-new startups and brand-new products.</p><p>Keep in mind there are three stages of profitability:</p><ol><li><p>Not remotely profitable: With the first version of a product you’re still testing out the market, testing out the product, trying to find your customers. Many products and companies die at this stage before they ever make a dime.</p></li><li><p>Making unit economics or gross margins: Hopefully with V2 you can make a gross profit with each product sold or each customer who subscribes to your service. Keep in mind that fantastic unit economics are not enough to make a profitable company. You’ll still be spending a ton of money just running your business and acquiring customers through sales and marketing.</p></li><li><p>Making business economics or net margins: With V3 you have the potential to make net profits with each subscription or product sold. That means that what you take in in sales revenue outstrips your business costs, so your company as a whole makes money.</p></li></ol><p>The reason it takes so long to reach gross margins and even longer to make net margins is that learning takes time. For your company and your customers.</p><p>Your team will have to figure out how to find product/market fit for V1, then get the product fixed up and properly marketed to a wider audience with V2, and only then can you focus on optimizing the business so it can be sustainable and profitable with V3.</p><p>And customers need time to feel you out. The vast majority of people aren’t early adopters—they won’t try new things right away. They need time to get used to the idea, time to read some reviews, time to ask their friends, and then time to wait until the next version comes out because that’ll probably be even cooler.</p><hr><p>I remember walking around the halls of General Magic reading Crossing the Chasm by Geoffrey Moore back in 1992 or 1993. A lot of us were reading it, discussing it, pointing out how right it was even as we hurtled deeper and deeper into the chasm and it became obvious we were never going to make it out.</p><p>The “chasm” is the hole companies can fall into if regular people—not just early adopters—won’t buy their product. Today it’s called finding product/market fit.</p><p>Crossing the Chasm introduced the world to the famous Customer Adoption Curve chart below. The idea behind it is pretty simple: a small percentage of customers will jump to buy a new product early regardless of how well it works—they just want the latest doohickey. However, most will wait until it’s been around for a while and all the kinks have been worked out.</p><p>image
Fig. 3.6.1</p><p>Geoffrey Moore first mapped out when different people are open to new products in his book Crossing the Chasm. But that’s not the whole story. It’s also critical to understand where V1, V2, and V3 of your product will fall on this chart and how that changes what you focus on—disruption, refinement, or the business.</p><p>Matteo Vianello</p><p>Who’s it for
V1</p><p>V2</p><p>V3</p><p>Innovators and early adopters.</p><p>Early majority.</p><p>Late majority and laggards.</p><p>These are the people who deeply love whatever it is you do—they might be gear heads or obsessed with technology or just really into your space. They’ll have an emotional reaction to anything new and cool and will buy it fully aware that it will probably be buggy.</p><p>These are the trendsetters. They watch the early adopters and will read some reviews before committing. They expect product bugs to be ironed out, decent customer support, and an easy way to learn about and purchase the product.</p><p>This is everyone else—the mass customers who expect perfection. They’ll only buy the clear winner in the marketplace and won’t put up with any hassles.</p><p>Product
V1</p><p>V2</p><p>V3</p><p>You’re essentially shipping your prototype.</p><p>You’re fixing the stuff you screwed up with V1.</p><p>You’re refining an already great product.</p><p>Customer acquisition costs will be sky-high; some features you really wanted will be missing; your marketing, sales, and customer support will all be a little wonky; you won’t have the partnerships you’ll need; and you’ll still be discovering everything you got wrong.</p><p>At this stage you’ll know what your problems are and how to fix them—both the unexpected issues that inevitably crop up after you launch and the stuff you cut corners on the first time. V2 usually comes swiftly after V1 because you’ve learned so much so fast and you’re dying to get it all into the next generation.</p><p>Your focus should be less on the product and more on the business and polishing every touchpoint of the customer lifecycle.</p><p>Outsourcing vs. building in-house
V1</p><p>V2</p><p>V3</p><p>Figuring things out and outsourcing.</p><p>Start bringing more things in-house.</p><p>Lock in internal expertise and selectively outsource smaller projects.</p><p>You have a small team so you have to outsource a ton of functions—marketing, PR, HR, legal. This will enable you to move fast and get a lot done, but it’s expensive and won’t scale.</p><p>You take everything you’ve learned from the third-party teams you worked with for V1 and start building that muscle in-house. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 5.3: Design for Everyone: But you shouldn’t outsource a problem.]<!-- --> Your teams and level of expertise grow.</p><p>Certain key internal teams will be focused on the most important differentiators of your business. That may mean doing branding in-house or legal or whatever is most important to your company. As these teams grow and do more, they begin outsourcing again, but only for specific, smaller tasks that are closely supervised by the internal team.</p><p>Product
V1</p><p>V2</p><p>V3</p><p>Product market fit.</p><p>Profitable product.</p><p>Profitable business.</p><p>This really just means getting the product right enough to prove there’s a market for it so you can cross the chasm.</p><p>If you can’t prove that at least early adopters will buy your V1, then you have to go back to the drawing board and start over.</p><p>At this point you’ll widen the market, start nailing more parts of the customer journey, and might even be making a little money per product—but probably not enough to cover costs.</p><p>Assuming you reached gross margins with V2, you may want to aim for net margins with V3. This is when you begin negotiating with partners for better deals, optimizing your customer support and sales channel, and buying new kinds of media for marketing. Hopefully you’ll finally get enough volume that you can start to reduce your prices and actually make real money. With V3 you have a chance to get it all right—the product, the company, and your business model.</p><p>But that’s not the whole story. If you don’t understand how customer adoption maps onto product and company development, you’re missing a very important part of the puzzle.</p><p>After companies find product/market fit, they can start to focus on profitability. Businesses that build with atoms are focused on COGS—cost of goods sold. Aside from direct labor, the main thing they spend money on is actually making the product. So they need to lower the cost of producing their product in order to reach profitability.</p><p>Companies that build with electrons are focused on CAC—customer acquisition costs. Aside from direct labor, their money gets spent selling and supporting their product.</p><p>Companies that build with both atoms and electrons have to worry about COGS and CAC, but generally should focus on one at a time. First knock out COGS, then move on to CAC. Build the product, then add the services.</p><p>And despite the many differences between atoms and electrons, hardware and software, there is one thing that has the exact same stranglehold on both: time.</p><p>No matter what you’re building, reaching profitability will take longer than you think. You will almost certainly not make any money with V1. You’ll need to reinvent yourself at least three times. Sometimes many more.</p><p>And even if your timeline has shrunk—even if you’re just revving an app—your product still has to learn how to crawl, and then walk, before it can run. That can take just as long for an app or service as it does for a hardware launch. It takes time to evolve and change, to react to customer feedback, to make every point on the customer journey as strong as the product itself. And customers still need time to learn about you, to try your product, to decide it’s worth it. They need time to march up the adoption curve.</p><p>The iPod took three generations—and three years—before it reached profitable unit economics.</p><p>Same story with the iPhone. The first version was really only for early adopters—it didn’t have 3G, didn’t have the app store, and our pricing model was all wrong. Steve never wanted the phone to be subsidized—he wanted everyone to know its real price so they could value it appropriately—and he wanted to get a cut of the data plan, too. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 6.4: Fuck Massages: When people pay for something, they value it.]<!-- --> But the iPhone was destined to cross the chasm—the world loved it. They just needed us to get the details right before they bought it.</p><p>But crossing the chasm isn’t a guarantee, even with much-loved products. And actually making money is much, much harder.</p><p>Of course with the internet, new business models challenge this conventional wisdom. Even so, many companies—Instagram, WhatsApp, YouTube, Uber—have gone through five or ten or more generations before they figured out how to make money. Many others still haven’t. The reason unprofitable companies are still around is that they have a giant pool of VC funding or were acquired by even larger tech companies. They focused on finding product/market fit and building their user base first, and figured they’d iterate on the business model to make money later. But that does not work for everyone. It relies on a swift dive across the chasm and then a long, meandering doggy paddle to profitability through a huge pool of capital. That can doom a company just as fatally as falling into the chasm on the first step.</p><p>A few years ago the major cities of the world were flooded with scooter- and bike-sharing companies. All at once it seemed like they were everywhere. And that was the approach—these companies wanted to get as much market share as they could in order to acquire customers.</p><p>They had enough capital that they just bought up whatever bikes they could and expanded and expanded and expanded.</p><p>But they could never make it profitable. They couldn’t get to V2 or V3. By the time they started figuring it out, they ran out of money—the endless pool ran dry.</p><p>Now the second- and third-generation scooter and bike companies are emerging, but they’re taking a completely different approach after watching their predecessors flame out. They’re extremely selective about their markets and are choosing the right atoms—incredibly durable bikes and scooters. They’re being wary about where they spend their money and making sure they understand the unit economics in excruciating detail.</p><p>Having that kind of laser focus on a few key differentiating elements is a much likelier way to reach your goals than throwing out a wide net and hoping for the best.</p><p>In the early days, Tesla was so focused on the car itself—and really only several parts of the car—that almost nothing else mattered. They had basically no customer support—there was nobody you could talk to on the phone. So if your Tesla had an issue, they’d just come to your house and drive it away. You’d be left without a car, wondering what you were supposed to do next.</p><p>Luckily Silicon Valley, Tesla’s home base, is filled with many tech enthusiasts and early adopters. A friend of mine bought one of the earliest Tesla Roadsters—their V1. It was really an electrified Lotus, hadn’t been fully redesigned from the ground up, but it had one of Tesla’s core features: regenerative brakes. Every time you hit the brakes, your car would use the motor as a generator to charge up the battery.</p><p>The trouble was my friend lived on a mountaintop. So he’d drive up the mountain and plug in his car for the night, but when he drove back down in the morning, his brakes barely worked. Turned out he couldn’t charge the Tesla to 100 percent—keeping his foot on the brake on the way down the mountain overcharged the battery. Tesla had to fix their braking and charging algorithms to keep him from crashing.</p><p>But my friend was the definition of an early adopter—he loved his Roadster. Even though it spent more time in the shop than his driveway. Even when he started just calling the engineers directly when he had an issue.</p><p>Early adopters know nobody gets everything right with V1. Nobody even gets everything they were originally planning for V1 into V1. The product and customer base evolve and grow with each iteration, and every stage brings on different risks and challenges and investments. Nobody can tackle them all at once. Not at a startup, not at a big company.</p><p>So you and your employees and your customers all need to have the right expectations. And so do your investors.</p><p>Far too many people expect profitability, for the product and the business, right out of the gate. When I was at Philips I watched most new product categories and businesses on their slate get cancelled—even for products that were almost ready to ship. Built. Tested. Done. They would die on the vine because the top brass were protecting themselves. Any execs joining the team always wanted a near guarantee that new products would make money. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 2.2: Data Versus Opinion: Most people don’t even want to acknowledge that there are opinion-driven decisions.]<!-- --> They demanded to be shown ahead of time that the unit and business economics of the product were sound. But that was impossible.</p><p>They were asking us to predict the future with near 100 percent confidence. They were asking for proof that a baby could run a marathon before it had even learned to walk.</p><p>These guys didn’t know much about babies. They knew even less about how to create a new business.</p><p>That’s why so many Kickstarter projects have failed. They thought, “If I build it for $50 and sell it for $200, then I’ll make money. My company will be a success.” But that’s not how companies work. That $150 profit gets sucked away with every new office chair and dependent on your employees’ insurance, with every customer support call and Instagram ad. Until you optimize the business, not just the product, you can never build something lasting.</p><p>image
Fig. 3.6.2</p><p>With every generation the product became sleeker, slimmer, and less expensive to build. You can see the leap from V1 to V2 in the product itself. When we launched the first generation, it was the most modern, beautifully made thermostat on the market. The moment we shipped V2, the original instantly looked heavy and clunky and outdated. By the time we reached V3, the changes to the product were more subtle but our business had been completely reinvented—costs were driven down, we were selling in new channels and countries, we had a slew of new partnerships, and customer support had been streamlined.</p><p>Dwight Eschliman</p><p>That’s how it went with all the current giants of tech: Google and Facebook and Twitter and Pinterest. Google wasn’t remotely profitable for a long time. They only started making real money when they figured out AdWords. Facebook decided to capture eyeballs, then figure out the business model later. So did Pinterest and Twitter. They created a V1 product, scaled it for V2, then optimized the business in V3.</p><p>The Nest Learning Thermostat followed the same pattern.</p><p>It was all so much easier for V2. There was less need to predict the future and more dealing with reality. We knew what customers liked and what they didn’t. We knew what they wanted and which features would help them most. And we got to attack the long list of things that we couldn’t quite manage to fit into the first version but that we were dying to fix for the second. V2 came out just a year after V1—we couldn’t wait to launch it.</p><p>The third-generation Nest Learning Thermostat arrived three years later. It’s also visibly different from the second gen, but the updates are more subtle. A slimmer profile. A larger screen. Most of the changes happened behind the scenes.</p><p>Gen 3 is when we really locked in our channel partners. With V1 we couldn’t properly break into retail. All we could do was sell our thermostats on nest.com to prove that people wanted to buy them. V2 made retailers sit up and consider us: Oh, maybe we should stock it.</p><p>But with V3 we were in Target and Best Buy and Home Depot and Lowe’s and Walmart and Costco—and not just on some distant shelf. We created completely new sections of each store dedicated to connected home products, creating a space not only for Nest but for the burgeoning smart home ecosystem that started to spring up around us.</p><p>All our partners saw that we were getting traction and wanted to keep our business, so we got better deals, better contracts. We improved customer support, got our price per call way down, and fixed up our knowledge base.</p><p>So when we started work on the Nest Protect smoke and CO alarm, our second product, you’d think it would be easier. That everything we’d built already would let us skip a few steps. But the second you start a new product, you have to hit the restart button—even if you’re at a big company. Sometimes it’s even harder the second time around because all the infrastructure that’s been built up for the first product gets in the way. So you’ll still need to go through at least three generations before you get it right.</p><p>You make the product. You fix the product. You build the business.</p><p>You make the product. You fix the product. You build the business.</p><p>You make the product. You fix the product. You build the business.</p><p>Every product. Every company. Every time.</p><p>Part IV
Build Your Business
I have to start this company, don’t I?</p><p>Shit.</p><p>A startup was not the plan. The plan was a break. A long one. I needed it—I’d finally left Apple in 2010 after almost a decade of heads-down sprinting. We had launched the first three generations of the iPhone and now the big swings were over. After eighteen generations of iPod, I knew how this would go—we’d make tweak after tweak after tweak ad infinitum. Or I could start on the iPad, which had basically the same guts as the iPod Touch, which was basically an iPhone.</p><p>But the bigger reason I quit was my family. I’d met my wife at Apple—Dani was vice president of HR. We had two very young children. And although we always made time for them, we also worked a ton. This was a chance to live differently. So Dani and I both left Apple. Then we left the country.</p><p>We traveled all over the globe and worked hard not to think about work. But no matter where we went, we could not escape one thing: the goddamn thermostat. The infuriating, inaccurate, energy-hogging, thoughtlessly stupid, impossible-to-program, always-too-hot-or-too-cold-in-some-part-of-the-house thermostat.</p><p>Someone needed to fix it. And eventually I realized that someone was going to be me.</p><p>The big companies weren’t going to do it. Honeywell and the other white-box competitors hadn’t truly innovated in thirty years. It was a dead, unloved market with less than $1 billion in total annual sales in the United States. And after a failed green innovation wave in 2007 and 2008, green-tech investors had firmly turned away from energy-saving devices. A small startup filled with fresh faces and few connections wouldn’t have the credibility to get funding. I could already hear the VCs sneer, “Thermostats? Really? You want to make thermostats? The market is tiny and boring and hard.”</p><p>But one day I was on a bike ride with Randy Komisar. Randy is a longtime friend, mentor, and a partner at the venerable venture firm Kleiner Perkins. We first met when I pitched him on investing in Fuse in 1999. Since I deeply trusted Randy, I decided to test my idea on him and floated the idea of a smart thermostat.</p><p>He offered to write me a check on the spot.</p><p>I was exactly the kind of founder investors like. Four failed startups and years of professional disappointment had paved the way for a decade of success. I was forty years old, knew exactly how hard this was going to be and which mistakes not to make again. I’d worked on hardware and software at tiny and enormous companies. I had contacts, credibility, and enough experience to know what I didn’t know. And I had an idea.</p><p>Your thermostat should learn the temperatures you like and when you like them. It should connect to your smartphone so you can control it from anywhere. It should turn itself down when you’re not home to save energy. And of course it should be beautiful—something you’d be proud to put on your wall.</p><p>The only thing missing was the will to take the plunge. I wasn’t ready to carry another startup on my back. Not then. Not alone.</p><p>Then, magically, Matt Rogers reached out to me. Matt had started as one of the first interns early on the iPod project and I’d watched him rocket ahead of everyone else on an already world-class handpicked team. We hired him full-time after graduation and he quickly became a fantastic manager—focused on team building, never afraid to ask questions or push boundaries, insatiably curious about every aspect of the business.</p><p>After I left Apple, he started getting frustrated with how things were going. So we had lunch and he asked what I was going to do next. I told him the idea. He was enthusiastic. And when I say enthusiastic, you should know that Matt is a perpetual motion machine of unstoppable energy. He immediately started digging in, offering suggestions and ideas, growing more and more excited the longer we talked.</p><p>That push was what I needed to commit. He was a real partner who could share the load, who’d work just as hard as me and care just as much. We already knew how to work together and saw eye-to-eye on how to make products. I didn’t need another middle-aged executive with decades of experience telling me what we couldn’t do. I needed a real cofounder. I needed Matt.</p><p>Together we took the idea and formed it into a vision. What we pitched to investors was a connected thermostat. But we knew the company we were really building—it wasn’t going to stop at thermostats. We would create a slew of products, reinventing unloved but important objects everyone needed at home. And, most importantly, we were going to create a platform. We were going to build the connected home.</p><p>The concept wasn’t new. Connected home systems had been around for a couple of decades by then. I remember Bill Atkinson from General Magic trying to build a connected home in the nineties. He tried to rig it himself, battling to make something useful. But over the years a lot of wealthy tech people just dropped a quarter million dollars to have an elaborate system built into their walls. There’d be sensors and screens and switches and controllers for thermostats, alarm systems, lights, music. All very shiny, very fancy. And complete crap. Garbage. None of it worked.</p><p>Our investors winced when we mentioned it in our pitch. Yes, they’d all been taken in. Yes, all their spouses were still pissed about it.</p><p>We wanted to take a different approach. Instead of trying to cram a fully formed platform with every possible gadget into someone’s house, we were going to start with just one really good product—a beautiful thermostat that would live on people’s walls for a decade or more. Once people fell in love with our thermostat, they’d buy more products that worked with it. Customers would be able to assemble a connected home piece by piece, creating a unique system that made sense for their house and their family.</p><p>The thermostat would be our way in.</p><p>But first we had to build the thermostat.</p><p>Making it beautiful wasn’t going to be hard. Gorgeous hardware, an intuitive interface—that we could do. We’d honed those skills at Apple. To make this product successful—and meaningful—we needed to solve two big problems:</p><p>It needed to save energy. And we needed to sell it.</p><p>In North America and Europe, thermostats control half a home’s energy bill—something like $2,500/year. Every previous attempt to reduce that number—by thermostat manufacturers, by energy companies, by government bodies—had failed miserably for a host of different reasons. We had to do it for real, while keeping it dead simple for customers.</p><p>Then we needed to sell it. Almost all thermostats at that point were sold and installed by professional HVAC technicians. We were never going to break into that old boys’ club. We had to find a way into people’s minds first, then their homes. And we had to make our thermostat so easy to install that literally anyone could do it themselves.</p><p>So we got to work.</p><p>image
Fig. 4.0.1</p><p>The Nest Learning Thermostat launched in October 2011 for $249. It had a unique round 2.75-inch screen and measured 3.2 x 3.2 x 1.6 inches. It came with its own mobile app and had a built-in AI that learned your schedule and turned itself down when you were away.</p><p>Dwight Eschliman</p><p>It was fatter than we wanted. The screen wasn’t quite what I imagined. Kind of like the first iPod, actually. But it worked. It connected to your phone. You could install it yourself. It learned what temperatures you liked. It turned itself down when nobody was home. It saved energy.</p><p>And people loved it.</p><p>Before we launched we didn’t know if anyone would be interested, so we didn’t want to spend all our money and have a ton of inventory sitting in warehouses. Incredibly, we sold out on the first day, then we were continually sold out for more than two years.</p><p>We quickly followed up with the second-generation thermostat, fixing all the things we hadn’t gotten quite right with the first one. And then we focused on our next product. What device existed in every single home and was even more infuriating than the thermostat?</p><p>Easy: the smoke alarm.</p><p>The annoying, false-alarming, constantly-going-off-while-you’re-cooking-and-chirping-at-2-a.m.-so-you-have-to-hunt-down-which-stupid-alarm-has-low-batteries-and-of-course-it-turns-out-to-be-the-one-you-can’t-reach smoke alarm.</p><p>Had we realized how hard it would be to innovate in the smoke and CO space, we probably wouldn’t have even started. But all we knew was that smoke alarms were everywhere, in every room of every house. And they were awful. Truly, monumentally terrible. They were required by law in every home, so smoke alarm manufacturers had no incentive to make them any better—awful or not, they had to be everywhere.</p><p>But their awfulness was so all-encompassing that people would literally risk their lives to make them shut up—removing batteries or tearing smoke detectors off the wall after one too many false alarms, knocking them off the ceiling with a golf club in the middle of the night just to stop the infernal chirping.</p><p>So in 2013 the Nest Protect smoke and CO alarm was born.</p><p>image
Fig. 4.0.2</p><p>The Nest Protect retailed for $119, was 5.28 x 5.28 inches, and offered protection from carbon monoxide and smoke. False alarms could be hushed from the app and you’d get an alert on your phone if there was danger.</p><p>Dwight Eschliman</p><p>I had made successful products before—the iPod, the iPhone—but Nest was my first time trying to truly build a large, successful business. It was the first time I started from scratch—from a single cell of an idea—and watched that cell divide and grow into a fully formed baby. Our baby. Our company.</p><p>So if you want to start a business or a new product or project within a big company—or if you’ve already started and are looking on in joy, fear, and amazement as it begins to take on a life of its own—then here’s what I’ve learned about choosing an idea, starting a company, finding investors, and almost passing out from stress.</p><p>This is what I’ve figured out so far about every stage of growth—and what you should do when your baby isn’t a baby anymore.</p><p>Chapter 4.1
How to Spot a Great Idea
There are three elements to every great idea:</p><ol><li><p>It solves for “why.” Long before you figure out what a product will do, you need to understand why people will want it. The “why” drives the “what.” <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 3.2: Why Storytelling.]</p></li><li><p>It solves a problem that a lot of people have in their daily lives.</p></li><li><p>It follows you around. Even after you research and learn about it and try it out and realize how hard it’ll be to get it right, you can’t stop thinking about it.</p></li></ol><p>Before you commit to executing on an idea—to starting a company or launching a new product—you should commit to researching it and trying it out first. Practice delayed intuition. This is a phrase coined by the brilliant, Nobel Prize–winning economist and psychologist Daniel Kahneman to describe the simple concept that to make better decisions, you need to slow down.</p><p>The more amazing an idea seems—the more it tugs at your gut, blinds you to everything else—the longer you should wait, prototype it, and gather as much information about it as possible before committing. If this idea is going to eat up years of your life, you should at least take a few months to research it, build out detailed (enough) business and product development plans, and see if you’re still excited about it. See if it will chase you.</p><p>And keep in mind that not all decisions rise to this level. Most day-to-day decisions can and should be made quickly, especially if you’re iterating on something that already exists. You should still take your time and consider your options and make sure you’re thinking through next steps, but not every idea has to chase you around for a month.</p><hr><p>The best ideas are painkillers, not vitamins.</p><p>Vitamin pills are good for you, but they’re not essential. You can skip your morning vitamin for a day, a month, a lifetime and never notice the difference.</p><p>But you’ll notice real quick if you forget a painkiller.</p><p>Painkillers eliminate something that’s constantly bothering you. A regular irritation you can’t get rid of. And the best pain—so to speak—is one you experience in your own life. Most startups are born from people getting so frustrated with something in their daily experience that they start digging in and trying to find a solution.</p><p>Not every product idea has to come from your own life, but the “why” always has to be crisp and easy to articulate. You have to be able to easily, clearly, persuasively explain why people will need it. That’s the only way to understand what features it should have, whether the timing is right for it to exist, whether the market for it will be tiny or enormous.</p><p>Once you have a really strong “why,” you have the germ of a great idea. But you can’t build a business on a germ. First you have to figure out if this idea is actually strong enough to carry a company. You need to build a business and implementation plan. And you have to understand if it’s something you want to work on for the next five to ten years of your life.</p><p>The only way to know is to see if it will chase you. And the chasing process is always the same:</p><p>First, you’re dumbstruck by how great an idea this is. How has nobody thought of this before?
Then you start looking into it. And oh, okay—they have thought of it. They tried it and failed. Or maybe you really have stumbled into something nobody has ever done before. And the reason is this insane, impossible obstacle that there’s no way to get around. You begin to understand how hard it would be to do this—there’s so much you don’t know. So you put it aside.
But you can’t get it out of your head. So you research it here and there. You start sketching or coding or writing, making little prototypes of what this thing could be. Napkin drawings constantly fall out of your bag. Your notebook is full of feature ideas, sales ideas, marketing ideas, business model ideas. You think that maybe the people who tried this idea before were taking the wrong approach. Or maybe an obstacle that was stopping others can now be solved with a new technology—maybe the moment for this idea has finally come.
That’s when it starts to get more real for you. So you decide to commit to really looking into it, to digging deep to make an informed decision. You need to figure out whether you should pursue this idea or not.
One day you realize there’s a way around that one impossible obstacle. You’re thrilled! Until you see the next huge roadblock in your way. Crap. It’ll never work. But you keep digging and trying things and getting advice from experts and friends and you realize, actually, maybe there’s a way around that, too.
People start asking you about your project—when are you going to start? Can I join? Are you taking angel investment? Each obstacle turns into an opportunity, each problem pushes you to find a new solution, and each solution gets you more excited about this idea.
Even though there are still a million unknowns—they’re not unknown unknowns anymore. You understand the space. You can see what this business could become. And you start to gain momentum from all the research you’ve done and barriers you’ve conquered. It feels like it’s all coming together. You feel in your gut that this is the right decision. So you bite the bullet and commit.
For me, this whole process took ten years. That’s how long the thermostat chased me.</p><p>That is pretty extreme, by the way. If you’ve got an idea for a business or a new product, you usually don’t have to wait a decade to make sure it’s worth doing.</p><p>But you should commit a month—or two, or six—to researching and poking around and making some rough prototypes, articulating your story of “why.” If during that month—or two, or six—you only get more excited about the idea and can’t stop thinking about it, then you can get more serious. Take at least another few months—possibly up to a year—to look at it from every angle and consult with people you trust, create some business plans and presentations, and prepare as well as you possibly can.</p><p>You do not want to start a company only to discover that your seemingly great idea is a shiny veneer over a hollow tooth, ready to crack at the slightest pressure.</p><p>A lot of startups have a “fail fast” mentality in Silicon Valley. It’s a trendy term that means instead of planning carefully for what you want to make, you build first and figure it out later. You iterate until you “find” success. This can manifest in two ways—either you knock out a product quickly then iterate even faster to get to something people want, or you quit your job, cut loose from your commitments, and sit around thinking up startup ideas until you find a business that works. The former approach sometimes works; the latter usually fails.</p><p>Throwing darts at a wall is not how you pick a great idea. Anything worth doing takes time. Time to understand. Time to prepare. Time to get it right. You can fast-track a lot of things and skimp on others, but you cannot cheat time.</p><p>That said, ten years is a little much. But for most of the ten years that I idly thought about thermostats, I had no intention of building one. I was at Apple making the first iPhone, leading a huge team. I was learning and growing, up to my eyeballs in work. And eventually I got married, had kids. I was busy.</p><p>But then again, I was also really cold. Bone-chillingly cold.</p><p>Every time my wife and I drove up to our Lake Tahoe ski cabin on Friday nights after work, we’d have to keep our snow jackets on until the next day. The house took all night to heat up since we kept it just above freezing when we were away to avoid wasting energy and money.</p><p>And I felt the pain. Walking into that frigid house drove me nuts. It was mind-boggling that there wasn’t a way to warm it up before we got there. I spent dozens of hours and thousands of dollars trying to hack security and computer equipment tied to an analog phone so I could fire up the thermostat remotely. Half my vacations were spent elbow-deep in wiring, electronics littering the floor. My wife rolled her eyes—you are on vacation! But nothing worked. So the first night of every trip was always the same: we’d huddle on the ice block of a bed, under the freezing sheets, watching our breath turn into fog until the house finally warmed up by morning.</p><p>Then on Monday I’d go back to Apple and work on the first iPhone.</p><p>Eventually I realized I was making a perfect remote control for a thermostat. If I could just connect the HVAC system to my iPhone, I could control it from anywhere. But the technology that I needed to make it happen—reliable low-cost communications, cheap screens and processors—didn’t exist yet. So I tried to set the idea aside. Focus on my work. Not think about the cold.</p><p>A year later we decided to build a new, super-efficient house in Tahoe. During the day I’d work on the iPhone, then I’d come home and pore over specs for our house, choosing finishes and materials and solar panels and, eventually, tackling the HVAC system. And once again, the thermostat came to haunt me. All the top-of-the-line thermostats were hideous beige boxes with bizarrely confusing user interfaces. They touted the fact that they had touchscreens and clocks and calendars and showed digital photos. None of them saved energy. None could be controlled remotely. And they cost around $400. The iPhone was selling for $499.</p><p>How did these ugly, piece-of-crap thermostats cost almost as much as Apple’s most cutting-edge technology?</p><p>The architects and engineers on the Tahoe project heard me complaining over and over about how insane it was. I told them, “One day, I’m going to fix this—mark my words!” They all rolled their eyes—there goes Tony complaining again!</p><p>At first they were just idle words born of frustration. But then things started to change. The success of the iPhone drove down costs for the sophisticated components I couldn’t get my hands on earlier. Suddenly high-quality connectors and screens and processors were being manufactured by the millions, cheaply, and could be repurposed for other technology.</p><p>And my life was changing, too. I quit Apple and began traveling the world with my family. And in every hotel room, every house, every country, every continent—every thermostat sucked. We were too hot, or too cold, or just couldn’t figure out how to use them. The entire world had the same problem—this forgotten, unloved product that everyone had to have in their home was costing people tons of money on their bills and wasting untold amounts of energy while the planet just kept warming.</p><p>After that, the chase kicked into high gear. I couldn’t shake the idea of making a connected thermostat. An actually smart thermostat. One that would solve my problem and save energy. One that would allow me to build on everything I had previously made.</p><p>So I let the idea catch me. I came back to Silicon Valley and got to work. I researched the technology, then the opportunity, the business, the competition, the people, the financing, the history. If I was going to upend my life and my family, take a huge risk, dedicate five to ten years to creating a device unlike anything I’d ever made in a space I knew nothing about, then I needed to give myself time to learn. I needed to sketch out designs. I needed to plan out features and think about the sales and business model.</p><p>During this time, I’d also play a little game with myself and people I truly respected. They’d ask me, “What’s keeping you busy now? What’s interesting to you?” So I’d tell them I had an idea—maybe a great idea—and share a few details to get their reactions and thoughts and questions. I was developing my pitch, figuring out the story of the product just like Steve would do. Then as the weeks of research and strategy began to come together, I stopped saying it was an idea and started saying I was building a product. Even though it wasn’t quite true yet. But I wanted it to feel real—to get them, and especially me, to really dive to the details. I wanted to convince them and I wanted them to challenge it and I wanted to tell the story. To figure out if it held together.</p><p>It took around nine to twelve months of making prototypes and interactive models, building bits of software, talking to users and experts, and testing it with friends before Matt and I decided to take the plunge and actually pitch investors.</p><p>We didn’t have perfect data that we’d succeed. No amount of research or delayed intuition will ever guarantee that. We probably had 40–50 percent of the risks of starting this company identified, with ideas for how to mitigate them. But there were still vast, yawning unknowns before us. In the end, even with all our hard work and preparation, this was an opinion-driven decision. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 2.2: Data Versus Opinion.]<!-- --> So we went with our gut. It felt scary as hell, but it also felt right.</p><p>The interesting thing is that delayed intuition generally doesn’t make it less scary. If anything, the more you understand it, the more butterflies in your stomach it’ll give you. Because you’ll uncover all the ways it can go wrong; you’ll know the million things that might kill this idea and your business and your time.</p><p>But knowing what can kill you makes you stronger.</p><p>And knowing that you’ve already deflected some major bullets makes you stronger still.</p><p>That’s why we didn’t just present our vision when we pitched investors. We presented the why—told our story—and then we presented the risks. Too many startups don’t know what they’re getting into or, worse, try to cover up the risks of failure. But if investors can spot holes in your plan that you completely missed or ignored or carefully avoided, they won’t have the confidence to fund you. So we listed our risks: building an AI, compatibility with hundreds of different (and ancient) HVAC systems, customer installation, retail, and the really big one—would anyone even care? Would the world want a smart thermostat? The potential company-destroying problems—and the steps to mitigate them—went on and on. But listing them out, breaking them down, talking honestly about them, that’s what ultimately convinced investors that we really knew what we were getting into. And that we could make it work.</p><p>Eventually, each of those risks became a rallying cry for the team—instead of avoiding them, we embraced them. We continually said to ourselves, “If it were easy, everyone else would be doing it!” We were innovating. The risks and our ability to solve for them was what set us apart. We would do something nobody else thought possible.</p><p>That’s ultimately what made this company worth starting.</p><p>Of course, all this is not to say that you should wait and research endlessly to make every little decision in your life. If you’re not starting from scratch—if you’re iterating—then everything speeds up.</p><p>It took me a decade to decide to build my first thermostat. Deciding to build a second version probably took a week. In fact, we already knew what the second version should be before we even finished the first one. We’d proven the market potential and the technology—now we just needed to refine it. Of course we’d make a second-generation thermostat. We’d already done the hard part. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 3.4: Your First Adventure—and Your Second.]</p><p>If you’re optimizing, you have data, constraints, and experience to lead you. You’ll already know what it takes to get to V1, so reaching V2 won’t be as much of a stretch. Or a mystery. V2 is never as scary as V1.</p><p>V1 is always completely, utterly terrifying. Always. Big, great, new ideas scare the living crap out of everyone who has them. That’s one of the signs that they’re great.</p><p>If you’re reading this book, you’re probably curious and engaged. And that means you will encounter many, many, many good ideas in your life. It seems like good ideas are everywhere. But the only way to know if they’re truly great—meaningful, disruptive, important, worth your time—is to learn enough about them to see their huge potential risks, the vast downsides, the icy blue Titanic-sized shitshow that lurks just below the surface. At that point you’ll probably set that idea aside. You’ll move on to other opportunities, other jobs and journeys. Until you realize that no matter what you do, you can’t stop thinking about that one idea. That’s when you stop running from it and start chipping away at the risks, one by one, until you’re confident enough that they’re worth taking.</p><p>If that does not happen, then it’s not a great idea. It’s a distraction. Keep going until you find an idea that won’t let you go.*</p><p>Chapter 4.2
Are You Ready?
The world is full of people who have an idea and want to start a company. Often they ask me if they’re ready. Do I have what it takes to create a successful startup? Should I launch my project within a big company instead?</p><p>The answer is that you’ll never know until you take the leap and try. But here’s how to get as ready as you’ll ever be:</p><ol><li><p>Work at a startup.</p></li><li><p>Work at a big company.</p></li><li><p>Get a mentor to help you navigate it all.</p></li><li><p>Find a cofounder to balance you out and share the load.</p></li><li><p>Convince people to join you. Your founding team should be anchored by seed crystals—great people who bring in more great people.</p></li></ol><hr><p>The archetypal entrepreneur is a twenty-year-old kid who lucks into a brilliant idea in their mom’s basement and watches it turn into a thriving company overnight. In the movie version, they parlay their technical genius into a flawed but effective leadership approach and watch the millions roll in. Then they buy a fancy car before learning the true value of friendship.</p><p>But that is not reality.</p><p>There’s always an exception, an incredible wunderkind who rides a unicorn to the moon, but most successful entrepreneurs are in their late thirties and forties. There’s a reason why investors prefer to back second-time entrepreneurs even if they failed the first time around. It’s because these founders spent their twenties screwing up and learning. Most follow the same path I did: they work hard, fail and fail, take risks and go to doomed startups and try out giant companies and take the wrong job and luck into an amazing team and quit too early or don’t quit soon enough. They bounce around like a pinball, constantly smacking their heads into something. They learn. Trial by fire.</p><p>According to the book Super Founder, by Ali Tamaseb, around 60 percent of the founders of billion-dollar startups started another company before their wild success and many lost a ton of money. Just 42 percent of them had a previous exit of $10 million or more, so the majority “failed” by the standards of venture capital.</p><p>But they came out on the other side with a basic mental model of a startup. They understood the operational details and what it might look like if that tiny startup became successful. That’s it. That’s the magical key to success.</p><p>The problem is that it takes years to get there. And everyone wants a shortcut.</p><p>But there’s nothing that prepares you for starting a startup except working at a startup. So go get a job. Find a startup or small, nimble company with founders who know (more or less) what they’re doing. You need a role model to mimic or an anti–role model to avoid. Stand in an office (or videoconference), watch it all come together, and get a feel for the basic building blocks:</p><p>What does an org chart look like?</p><p>What is sales?</p><p>How should marketing work?</p><p>What about HR, finance, legal?</p><p>You need a working knowledge of each discipline—not to be an expert in each, but to understand who you should hire, what their qualifications should be, where to find them, and when you’ll need them. For example, you probably don’t need HR at the start. You just need recruiting. You don’t need finance, you need accounting. You can outsource legal for now, but what about creative? When do you need operations? When do you need customer support? And what kind? Customer support for a brick-and-mortar store looks very different from customer support for e-commerce.</p><p>Spend your time at your startup job understanding the business you’re helping to build. And then go get another job—this time at a big company. That’s the only way to get a handle on the problems and challenges that bigger companies face, especially those beyond the product—the organization, the processes, the governance, the politics. The more you can observe how each type of company operates, the fewer questions you’ll have when you start your own.</p><p>Even if you have a brilliant idea for a world-changing product, when you’re starting a business, you need to run that business. Making something new is hard enough—the unknown unknowns that keep you up at night should be focused on the problem you’re trying to solve, not on whether to get a marketing agency or what kind of lawyer to hire. You won’t have time to screw up the basics, to waste time learning the fundamentals.</p><p>Money burns fast. If you don’t have the confidence to move forward quickly, you’ll have to continually slow down to consult a hundred people about a thousand decisions. You’ll get mired in options and opinions. “What’s the best? What’s the latest?” will rattle in your head endlessly. You’ll lose sight of where you’re trying to go in the face of all the different ways to get there.</p><p>Of course, that doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t consult with anyone. Doing it alone is impossible.</p><p>You’re going to need a mentor or a coach.</p><p>You’re going to need an incredible founding team.</p><p>And you’ll probably need a cofounder.</p><p>Starting a company is unfathomably stressful and a truly ungodly amount of work and sacrifice. You need a partner who can balance you out, who you can call at 2 a.m. because you know they’ll be awake, working on your startup, too. And who can call you when they’re down and need support. This is going to be lonely and painful and exhilarating and exhausting and sharing the load is the only way to keep from being crushed by it.</p><p>But be careful—even if you have a cofounder, there can only be one CEO. And if you pile on the cofounders, you’re asking for trouble. Having two founders works well. Three can work sometimes. I’ve never seen it work with more.</p><p>I remember one startup we worked with that had four cofounders. Every decision was made by consensus, which meant every decision took forever. They’d never started a company before, so even the most basic questions were endlessly debated—hiring, product changes, who to take money from, and how to structure the agreement. If they couldn’t agree they would hem and haw, trying to be nice, trying to be reasonable, watering down their opinions until the company fell behind the competition, ran out of money, and the board had to swoop in, remove some founders, and change the whole team around.</p><p>Sharing the load is one thing; unloading it altogether is another. If you’re going to lead a team, you need to be ready to lead.</p><p>When you close your eyes, you should already know exactly who your first employees will be. You should be able to write down a list of five names without a second thought. If you don’t have that list of names ready before you start, you probably shouldn’t be starting.</p><p>However, just having the list isn’t enough. You actually need to hire them. At least a few. And having them commit, really commit, is very different from just hearing them say, “Yeah! That’s cool. I’d love to work with you.” If you can’t get them to sign on the dotted line, you may need to rethink the whole thing.</p><p>Because in the beginning you’re not going to have HR to help you find and hire a world-class team. You won’t even have a recruiter. For the first twenty-five or so employees it’ll all come down to you and your cofounder—your vision, your network, your ability to convince people that you know what you’re doing. You can lean on your mentors and board (and hopefully early investors), you can put them to work to prop up your reputation, but ultimately you’re selling yourself and your vision for success.</p><p>You need a story people can get behind. <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 3.2: Why Storytelling.]<!-- --> People you respect. People who will help you create something great. Your team is your company. And your first hires are crucial—they’ll help you architect what your business and culture will become.</p><p>Every member of your founding team should be proven and great at what they do (consider any failed startups in their past a bonus—that means they know what to avoid this time around), but they also need to have the right mindset. Getting from 0 to 1 is a huge lift that asks a lot of everyone, especially considering it may not pay off. So you need individual contributors who will enthusiastically take the leap with you, either because they’re as excited by the idea as you are, or because they’re simply young or ambitious, or because they’ve already had some financial success and aren’t worried about paying rent for a while.</p><p>Titles, pay, and perks should never be your main draw, but that doesn’t mean you should be cheap. Try to be reasonably flexible and structure compensation so it fits the individuals you’re hiring. Some people may prefer cash over equity and that should always be an option. But most of your team should get generous equity packages—they are owners of the idea, too, so they should also be owners of the company. You want your team to have a vested interest in your success so when things go wrong—and they definitely will—those people will stick with you.</p><p>In those very, very early days you want people who are there for the mission above all. You’re looking for passion, enthusiasm, and mindset. And you’re looking for seed crystals.</p><p>Seed crystals are people who are so good and so well loved that they can almost single-handedly build large parts of your org. Typically they’re experienced leaders, either managers of large teams or super-ICs who everyone listens to. Once they’re in, a tidal wave of other awesome people will typically follow.</p><p>That’s how we built our core team at Nest. We sought out the best of the best, and they created their own gravity—pulling in more and more talent.</p><p>I remember looking around the office in those early days with my mentor, the gritty, boisterous, wise Bill Campbell. We stood there just grinning.</p><p>I first met Bill when he was on the board of directors at Apple. I got in touch again when I needed help as I was starting Nest. I remember he looked directly into my eyes with a dead stare, watching for any microexpressions, and asked, “Are you coachable?” Which meant, “Will you listen? Are you ready to learn?” That was the only qualification you needed to be coached by Bill—the ability to admit that you don’t know everything. That you’re going to screw up. And that you’re ready to learn from those screwups, listen to advice, and act on it.</p><p>Bill wasn’t remotely technical, had never been an engineer, but he knew people. He knew how to work with them and get the best out of them. He could tell me how to run a board meeting. He could tell me what to do if my team got stuck. And he could always see issues coming a mile away. When he saw I was about to take a wrong turn, he’d put his finger in his mouth, make a popping noise, and say, “You know what that is? That’s the sound of you pulling your head out of your ass.”</p><p>That’s what you need when you’re going to start a company or start a huge new project—a coach. A mentor. A source of wisdom and aid. Someone who can recognize a brewing problem and warn you about it before it happens. And someone who will quietly inform you that it’s dark right now because your head is jammed up your own ass, and who will give you a few tips to quickly remove it.</p><p>You can make do without a cofounder. You can survive for a while without a team. But you can’t make it without a mentor.</p><p>Find at least one person who you deeply trust and who believes in you. Not a life coach or an executive leadership consultant, not an agency, not someone who’s read a lot of case studies and is ready to charge you by the hour. And not your parents—they love you too much to be impartial. Find an operational, smart, useful mentor who has done it before, who likes you and wants to help.</p><p>You will need to lean on them when you start a company. Or even when you launch a project within a big company.</p><p>Just don’t think the latter option will be easier, that you’ll be able to skirt the difficulties of a startup by starting it within someone else’s corporation. Big companies are not a shortcut. Their spacious, attractive offices are littered with the skeletons of innovative little projects that died because they were set up for failure from the start.</p><p>You should only create a “startup” within a big company if they can offer you something unique—some technology, some resources that you can’t get access to anywhere else. And you have to make sure that you have the right incentives, org structure, and management air cover in place to give you a fighting chance of success.</p><p>You have to remember that you’ll be the proverbial gnat on the elephant’s ass, in competition with other vastly larger revenue streams, trying to earn a place at the table. Even if you’re at a billion-dollar company with nearly infinite resources, you can’t expect those resources to be funneled your way without a fight. And you can’t expect people at the company to take a risk on your project—to join your team and leave another, more established and respected area of the business—without some real reward. Same goes when you’re recruiting outside the business—when you’re trying to get someone to join your small new project at a big company versus going to a startup, you’ll need a really good explanation for why it’ll work and be worth their while. The calculus of risk and reward will have to make sense.</p><p>One reason we managed to put together an outstanding team to create the iPod was that our team could get relatively outsized stock and bonus plans that they couldn’t get anywhere else at Apple. The other important reason was that we had Steve Jobs fully behind us. Those two things allowed us to recruit amazing people—even though we couldn’t tell them what they’d be working on before they signed on—and survive the internal antibodies. Steve gave our tiny team an unfair advantage—gave us air cover and dropped bombs if anyone messed with us. There were times when the internal antibodies at Apple tried to expel us from the organization—we’d constantly hear “We have other priorities, we’ll help you if we have time.” Or “Why are we doing this project—it’s not core to our business.” But as long as our team was making reasonable (or unreasonable but important) requests, the teams who were stalling us would get a call from Steve. “If they’re asking for something, then give it to them for Christ’s sake! This is very important for the company!”</p><p>Nobody wanted to get that call. They learned not to throw themselves in front of a speeding train.</p><p>So if you don’t have a CEO who will go to bat for you, if you don’t have compensation packages that will attract a great team, if you don’t have the resources of a giant company but all of the overhead, then don’t try to start your project inside someone else’s business. Your best option is probably to go it alone. Either let your idea die or start a real startup.</p><p>Many startups are founded by entrepreneurs who just left big companies. They saw a need, pitched their bosses, got rejected, then struck out on their own. I watched it happen with Pierre Omidyar at General Magic. In his spare time, he wrote up some code to let people auction off collectibles to each other. When it started picking up steam, he asked if General Magic would be interested in it. No, thank you, was the answer; that’s a ridiculous idea. So he got a waiver from General Magic that said they claimed no rights to his work, quit, and started a small startup called eBay.</p><p>There were a lot of reasons for Pierre’s success—perfect timing, a great idea, the will to follow it, the skill to implement it, the ability to lead. He also had one huge advantage that many people don’t think about: he came from a startup. He knew how it worked, had plenty of examples of what to do—and what not to do.</p><p>I’ve seen way too many people come out of the corporate world, decide to start a company, and be completely unprepared for what it takes. If they’ve never been on a small team starting from scratch, they’re often a fish out of water. They spend too much money too fast. Hire too many people. Don’t put in the time, don’t have the startup mentality, can’t make hard decisions, are buried by consensus thinking. They end up making mediocre products or nothing at all.</p><p>Don’t let that be your story. If you want to start a company, if you want to start anything, to create something new, then you need to be ready to push for greatness. And greatness doesn’t come from nothing. You have to prepare. You have to know where you’re headed and remember where you came from. You have to make hard decisions and be the mission-driven “asshole.” <!-- -->[See also: Chapter 2.3: Assholes: Mission-driven “assholes.”]</p><p>So do the work. Know what you’re getting into. Trust your gut.</p><p>And when the time comes, you’ll be ready.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/xiong321123/personal-page/edit/main/docs/看书/build1.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_Z9Sw" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_vwxv"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/publicPage/docs/看书/How to win friends and influence people2"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">How to win friends and influence people2</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/publicPage/docs/看书/build2"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">build2</div></a></nav></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">文档</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/publicPage/docs/intro">介绍</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">交流</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/JcuDDQ2wpINoTdbsCT1kfQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">微信公众号<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/docusaurus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">个人微信号<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">更多</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/publicPage/blog">Blog</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2024 王雄.</div></div></div></footer></div>
