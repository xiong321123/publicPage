Preface
to Revised Edition
How to Win Friends and Influence People was first published
in 1937 in an edition of only five thousand copies.
Neither Dale Carnegie nor the publishers, Simon and
Schuster, anticipated more than this modest sale. To
their amazement, the book became an overnight sensation,
and edition after edition rolled off the presses to
keep up with the increasing public demand. Now to Win
Friends and InfEuence People took its place in publishing
history as one of the all-time international best-sellers.
It touched a nerve and filled a human need that was
more than a faddish phenomenon of post-Depression
days, as evidenced by its continued and uninterrupted
sales into the eighties, almost half a century later.
Dale Carnegie used to say that it was easier to make a
million dollars than to put a phrase into the English language.
How to Win Friends and Influence People became
such a phrase, quoted, paraphrased, parodied,
used in innumerable contexts from political cartoon to
novels. The book itself was translated into almost every
known written language. Each generation has discovered
it anew and has found it relevant.
Which brings us to the logical question: Why revise a
book that has proven and continues to prove its vigorous
and universal appeal? Why tamper with success?
To answer that, we must realize that Dale Carnegie
himself was a tireless reviser of his own work during his
lifetime. How to Win Friends and Influence People was
written to be used as a textbook for his courses in Effective
Speaking and Human Relations and is still used in
those courses today. Until his death in 1955 he constantly
improved and revised the course itself to make it
applicable to the evolving needs of an every-growing
public. No one was more sensitive to the changing currents
of present-day life than Dale Carnegie. He constantly
improved and refined his methods of teaching;
he updated his book on Effective Speaking several
times. Had he lived longer, he himself would have revised
How to Win Friends and Influence People to better
reflect the changes that have taken place in the world
since the thirties.
Many of the names of prominent people in the book,
well known at the time of first publication, are no longer
recognized by many of today’s readers. Certain examples
and phrases seem as quaint and dated in our social
climate as those in a Victorian novel. The important message
and overall impact of the book is weakened to that
extent.
Our purpose, therefore, in this revision is to clarify
and strengthen the book for a modern reader without
tampering with the content. We have not “changed”
Howto Win Friends and Influence People except to
make a few excisions and add a few more contemporary
examples. The brash, breezy Carnegie style is intact-even
the thirties slang is still there. Dale Carnegie wrote
as he spoke, in an intensively exuberant, colloquial,
conversational manner.
So his voice still speaks as forcefully as ever, in the
book and in his work. Thousands of people all over the
world are being trained in Carnegie courses in increasing
numbers each year. And other thousands are reading
and studying How to Win Friends and lnfluence People
and being inspired to use its principles to better their
lives. To all of them, we offer this revision in the spirit
of the honing and polishing of a finely made tool.

How This Book Was
Written-And Why
Dale Carnegie
During the first thirty-five years of the twentieth century,
the publishing houses of America printed more
than a fifth of a million different books. Most of them
were deadly dull, and many were financial failures.
“Many,” did I say? The president of one of the largest
publishing houses in the world confessed to me that his
company, after seventy-five years of publishing experience,
still lost money on seven out of every eight books
it published.
Why, then, did I have the temerity to write another
book? And, after I had written it, why should you bother
to read it?
Fair questions, both; and I&#x27;ll try to answer them.
I have, since 1912, been conducting educational
courses for business and professional men and women
in New York. At first, I conducted courses in public
speaking only - courses designed to train adults, by actual
experience, to think on their feet and express their
ideas with more clarity, more effectiveness and more
poise, both in business interviews and before groups.
But gradually, as the seasons passed, I realized that as
sorely as these adults needed training in effective speaking,
they needed still more training in the fine art of
getting along with people in everyday business and social
contacts.
I also gradually realized that I was sorely in need of
such training myself. As I look back across the years, I
am appalled at my own frequent lack of finesse and
understanding. How I wish a book such as this had been
placed in my hands twenty years ago! What a priceless
boon it would have been.
Dealing with people is probably the biggest problem
you face, especially if you are in business. Yes, and that
is also true if you are a housewife, architect or engineer.
Research done a few years ago under the auspices of the
Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching
uncovered a most important and significant fact - a fact
later confirmed by additional studies made at the Carnegie
Institute of Technology. These investigations revealed
that even in such technical lines as engineering,
about 15 percent of one&#x27;s financial success is due to
one’s technical knowledge and about 85 percent is due
to skill in human engineering-to personality and the
ability to lead people.
For many years, I conducted courses each season at
the Engineers’ Club of Philadelphia, and also courses
for the New York Chapter of the American Institute of
Electrical Engineers. A total of probably more than fifteen
hundred engineers have passed through my
classes. They came to me because they had finally realized,
after years of observation and experience, that the
highest-paid personnel in engineering are frequently
not those who know the most about engineering. One
can for example, hire mere technical ability in engineering,
accountancy, architecture or any other profession
at nominal salaries. But the person who has
technical knowledge plus the ability to express ideas, to
assume leadership, and to arouse enthusiasm among
people-that person is headed for higher earning power.
In the heyday of his activity, John D. Rockefeller said
that “the ability to deal with people is as purchasable a
commodity as sugar or coffee.” “And I will pay more for
that ability,” said John D., “than for any other under the
sun.”
Wouldn’t you suppose that every college in the land
would conduct courses to develop the highest-priced
ability under the sun? But if there is just one practical,
common-sense course of that kind given for adults in
even one college in the land, it has escaped my attention
up to the present writing.
The University of Chicago and the United Y.M.C.A.
Schools conducted a survey to determine what adults
want to study.
That survey cost $25,000 and took two years. The last
part of the survey was made in Meriden, Connecticut. It
had been chosen as a typical American town. Every
adult in Meriden was interviewed and requested to answer
156 questions-questions such as “What is your
business or profession? Your education? How do you
spend your spare time? What is your income? Your hobbies?
Your ambitions? Your problems? What subjects are
you most interested in studying?” And so on. That survey
revealed that health is the prime interest of adults
and that their second interest is people; how to understand
and get along with people; how to make people
like you; and how to win others to your way of thinking.
So the committee conducting this survey resolved to
conduct such a course for adults in Meriden. They
searched diligently for a practical textbook on the subject
and found-not one. Finally they approached one of
the world’s outstanding authorities on adult education
and asked him if he knew of any book that met the needs
of this group. “No,” he replied, &quot;I know what those
adults want. But the book they need has never been
written.”
I knew from experience that this statement was true,
for I myself had been searching for years to discover a
practical, working handbook on human relations.
Since no such book existed, I have tried to write one
for use in my own courses. And here it is. I hope you
like it.
In preparation for this book, I read everything that I
could find on the subject- everything from newspaper
columns, magazine articles, records of the family courts,
the writings of the old philosophers and the new
psychologists. In addition, I hired a trained researcher to
spend one and a half years in various libraries reading
everything I had missed, plowing through erudite tomes
on psychology, poring over hundreds of magazine articles,
searching through countless biographies, trying to
ascertain how the great leaders of all ages had dealt with
people. We read their biographies, We read the life stories
of all great leaders from Julius Caesar to Thomas Edison.
I recall that we read over one hundred biographies
of Theodore Roosevelt alone. We were determined
to spare no time, no expense, to discover every
practical idea that anyone had ever used throughout the
ages for winning friends and influencing people.
I personally interviewed scores of successful people,
some of them world-famous-inventors like Marconi
and Edison; political leaders like Franklin D. Roosevelt
and James Farley; business leaders like Owen D.
Young; movie stars like Clark Gable and Mary Pickford;
and explorers like Martin Johnson-and tried to discover
the techniques they used in human relations.
From all this material, I prepared a short talk. I called
it “How to Win Friends and Influence People.” I say
“short.” It was short in the beginning, but it soon
expanded to a lecture that consumed one hour and thirty
minutes. For years, I gave this talk each season to the
adults in the Carnegie Institute courses in New York.
I gave the talk and urged the listeners to go out and
test it in their business and social contacts, and then
come back to class and speak about their experiences
and the results they had achieved. What an interesting
assignment! These men and women, hungry for self-
improvement, were fascinated by the idea of working in a
new kind of laboratory - the first and only laboratory of
human relationships for adults that had ever existed.
This book wasn’t written in the usual sense of the
word. It grew as a child grows. It grew and developed
out of that laboratory, out of the experiences of thousands
of adults.
Years ago, we started with a set of rules printed on a
card no larger than a postcard. The next season we
printed a larger card, then a leaflet, then a series of booklets,
each one expanding in size and scope. After fifteen
years of experiment and research came this book.
The rules we have set down here are not mere theories
or guesswork. They work like magic. Incredible as
it sounds, I have seen the application of these principles
literally revolutionize the lives of many people.
To illustrate: A man with 314 employees joined one of
these courses. For years, he had driven and criticized
and condemned his employees without stint or discretion.
Kindness, words of appreciation and encouragement
were alien to his lips. After studying the principles
discussed in this book, this employer sharply altered his
philosophy of life. His organization is now inspired with
a new loyalty, a new enthusiasm, a new spirit of team-
work. Three hundred and fourteen enemies have been
turned into 314 friends. As he proudly said in a speech
before the class: “When I used to walk through my establishment,
no one greeted me. My employees actually
looked the other way when they saw me approaching.
But now they are all my friends and even the janitor
calls me by my first name.”
This employer gained more profit, more leisure and
-what is infinitely more important-he found far more
happiness in his business and in his home.
Countless numbers of salespeople have sharply increased
their sales by the use of these principles. Many
have opened up new accounts - accounts that they had
formerly solicited in vain. Executives have been given
increased authority, increased pay. One executive reported
a large increase in salary because he applied
these truths. Another, an executive in the Philadelphia
Gas Works Company, was slated for demotion when he
was sixty-five because of his belligerence, because of his
inability to lead people skillfully. This training not only
saved him from the demotion but brought him a promotion
with increased pay.
On innumerable occasions, spouses attending the banquet
given at the end of the course have told me that
their homes have been much happier since their husbands
or wives started this training.
People are frequently astonished at the new results
they achieve. It all seems like magic. In some cases, in
their enthusiasm, they have telephoned me at my home
on Sundays because they couldn’t wait forty-eight hours
to report their achievements at the regular session of the
course.
One man was so stirred by a talk on these principles
that he sat far into the night discussing them with other
members of the class. At three o’clock in the morning,
the others went home. But he was so shaken by a realization
of his own mistakes, so inspired by the vista of a
new and richer world opening before him, that he was
unable to sleep. He didn’t sleep that night or the next
day or the next night.
Who was he? A naive, untrained individual ready to
gush over any new theory that came along? No, Far from
it. He was a sophisticated, blasé dealer in art, very much
the man about town, who spoke three languages fluently
and was a graduate of two European universities.
While writing this chapter, I received a letter from a
German of the old school, an aristocrat whose forebears
had served for generations as professional army officers
under the Hohenzollerns. His letter, written from a
transatlantic steamer, telling about the application of
these principles, rose almost to a religious fervor.
Another man, an old New Yorker, a Harvard graduate,
a wealthy man, the owner of a large carpet factory, declared
he had learned more in fourteen weeks through
this system of training about the fine art of influencing
people than he had learned about the same subject during
his four years in college. Absurd? Laughable? Fantastic?
Of course, you are privileged to dismiss this
statement with whatever adjective you wish. I am
merely reporting, without comment, a declaration made
by a conservative and eminently successful Harvard
graduate in a public address to approximately six
hundred people at the Yale Club in New York on the
evening of Thursday, February 23, 1933.
“Compared to what we ought to be,” said the famous
Professor William James of Harvard, “compared to what
we ought to be, we are only half awake. We are making
use of only a small part of our physical and mental resources.
Stating the thing broadly, the human individual
thus lives far within his limits. He possesses powers of
various sorts which he habitually fails to use,”
Those powers which you “habitually fail to use”! The
sole purpose of this book is to help you discover, develop
and profit by those dormant and unused assets,
“Education,” said Dr. John G. Hibben, former president
of Princeton University, “is the ability to meet life’s
situations,”
If by the time you have finished reading the first three
chapters of this book- if you aren’t then a little better
equipped to meet life’s situations, then I shall consider
this book to be a total failure so far as you are concerned.
For “the great aim of education,” said Herbert Spencer,
“is not knowledge but action.”
And this is an action book.
DALE CARNEGIENine Suggestions
on How to Get the Most
Out of This Book</li><li>If you wish to get the most out of this book, there is
one indispensable requirement, one essential infinitely
more important than any rule or technique. Unless you
have this one fundamental requisite, a thousand rules on
how to study will avail little, And if you do have this
cardinal endowment, then you can achieve wonders
without reading any suggestions for getting the most out
of a book.
What is this magic requirement? Just this: a deep,
driving desire to learn, a vigorous determination to increase
your ability to deal with people.
How can you develop such an urge? By constantly
reminding yourself how important these principles are
to you. Picture to yourself how their mastery will aid you
in leading a richer, fuller, happier and more fulfilling
life. Say to yourself over and over: &quot;My popularity, my
happiness and sense of worth depend to no small extent
upon my skill in dealing with people.”</li><li>Read each chapter rapidly at first to get a bird&#x27;s-eye
view of it. You will probably be tempted then to rush on
to the next one. But don’t - unless you are reading
merely for entertainment. But if you are reading because
you want to increase your skill in human relations, then
go back and reread each chapter thoroughly. In the long
run, this will mean saving time and getting results.</li><li>Stop frequently in your reading to think over what
you are reading. Ask yourself just how and when you can
apply each suggestion.</li><li>Read with a crayon, pencil, pen, magic marker or
highlighter in your hand. When you come across a suggestion
that you feel you can use, draw a line beside it.
If it is a four-star suggestion, then underscore every sentence
or highlight it, or mark it with “****.” Marking and
underscoring a book makes it more interesting, and far
easier to review rapidly.</li><li>I knew a woman who had been office manager for
a large insurance concern for fifteen years. Every month,
she read all the insurance contracts her company had
issued that month. Yes, she read many of the same contracts
over month after month, year after year. Why? Because
experience had taught her that that was the only
way she could keep their provisions clearly in mind.
I once spent almost two years writing a book on public
speaking and yet I found I had to keep going back over
it from time to time in order to remember what I had
written in my own book. The rapidity with which we
forget is astonishing.
So, if you want to get a real, lasting benefit out of this
book, don’t imagine that skimming through it once will
suffice. After reading it thoroughly, you ought to spend
a few hours reviewing it every month, Keep it on your
desk in front of you every day. Glance through it often.
Keep constantly impressing yourself with the rich possibilities
for improvement that still lie in the offing. Remember
that the use of these principles can be made
habitual only by a constant and vigorous campaign of
review and application. There is no other way.</li><li>Bernard Shaw once remarked: “If you teach a man
anything, he will never learn.” Shaw was right. Learning
is an active process. We learn by doing. So, if you desire
to master the principles you are studying in this
book, do something about them. Apply these rules at
every opportunity. If you don’t you will forget them
quickly. Only knowledge that is used sticks in your
mind.
You will probably find it difficult to apply these suggestions
all the time. I know because I wrote the book,
and yet frequently I found it difficult to apply everything
I advocated. For example, when you are displeased, it is
much easier to criticize and condemn than it is to try to
understand the other person’s viewpoint. It is frequently
easier to find fault than to find praise. It is more natural
to talk about what vou want than to talk about what the
other person wants. And so on, So, as you read this book,
remember that you are not merely trying to acquire information.
You are attempting to form new habits. Ah
yes, you are attempting a new way of life. That will require
time and persistence and daily application.
So refer to these pages often. Regard this as a working
handbook on human relations; and whenever you are
confronted with some specific problem - such as handling
a child, winning your spouse to your way of thinking,
or satisfying an irritated customer - hesitate about
doing the natural thing, the impulsive thing. This is usually
wrong. Instead, turn to these pages and review the
paragraphs you have underscored. Then try these new
ways and watch them achieve magic for you.</li><li>Offer your spouse, your child or some business
associate a dime or a dollar every time he or she catches
you violating a certain principle. Make a lively game out
of mastering these rules.</li><li>The president of an important Wall Street bank
once described, in a talk before one of my classes, a
highly efficient system he used for self-improvement.
This man had little formal schooling; yet he had become
one of the most important financiers in America, and he
confessed that he owed most of his success to the constant
application of his homemade system. This is what
he does, I’ll put it in his own words as accurately as I
can remember.
“For years I have kept an engagement book showing
all the appointments I had during the day. My family
never made any plans for me on Saturday night, for the
family knew that I devoted a part of each Saturday evening
to the illuminating process of self-examination and
review and appraisal. After dinner I went off by myself,
opened my engagement book, and thought over all the
interviews, discussions and meetings that had taken
place during the week. I asked myself:
‘What mistakes did I make that time?’
‘What did I do that was right-and in what way
could I have improved my performance?’
‘What lessons can I learn from that experience?’
“I often found that this weekly review made me very
unhappy. I was frequently astonished at my own blunders.
Of course, as the years passed, these blunders became
less frequent. Sometimes I was inclined to pat
myself on the back a little after one of these sessions.
This system of self-analysis, self-education, continued
year after year, did more for me than any other one thing
I have ever attempted.
“It helped me improve my ability to make decisions</li></ol><ul><li>and it aided me enormously in all my contacts with
people. I cannot recommend it too highly.”
Why not use a similar system to check up on your
application of the principles discussed in this book? If
you do, two things will result.
First, you will find yourself engaged in an educational
process that is both intriguing and priceless.
Second, you will find that your ability to meet and
deal with people will grow enormously.</li></ul><ol start="9"><li>You will find at the end of this book several blank
pages on which you should record your triumphs in the
application of these principles. Be specific. Give names,
dates, results. Keeping such a record will inspire you to
greater efforts; and how fascinating these entries will be
when you chance upon them some evening years from
now!
In order to get the most out of this book:
a. Develop a deep, driving desire to master the principles
of human relations,
b. Read each chapter twice before going on to the next
one.
c. As you read, stop frequently to ask yourself how
you can apply each suggestion.
d. Underscore each important idea.
e. Review this book each month.
f . Apply these principles at every opportunity. Use
this volume as a working handbook to help you
solve your daily problems.
g. Make a lively game out of your learning by offering
some friend a dime or a dollar every time he or she
catches you violating one of these principles.
h. Check up each week on the progress you are mak-ing.
Ask yourself what mistakes you have made,
what improvement, what lessons you have learned
for the future.
i. Keep notes in the back of this book showing how
and when you have applied these principles.
PART O N E
Fundamental Techniques in
Handling People
“IF YOU WANT TO GATHERHONEY, DON’T KICK OVER THEBEEHIVE”On May 7, 1931, the most sensational manhunt New
York City had ever known had come to its climax. After
weeks of search, “Two Gun” Crowley - the killer, the
gunman who didn’t smoke or drink - was at bay, trapped
in his sweetheart’s apartment on West End Avenue.
One hundred and fifty policemen and detectives laid
siege to his top-floor hideway. They chopped holes in
the roof; they tried to smoke out Crowley, the “cop
killer,” with teargas. Then they mounted their machine
guns on surrounding buildings, and for more than an
hour one of New York’s fine residential areas reverberated
with the crack of pistol fire and the rut-tat-tat of
machine guns. Crowley, crouching behind an over-
stuffed chair, fired incessantly at the police. Ten thousand
excited people watched the battle. Nothing like it
ever been seen before on the sidewalks of New
York.
When Crowley was captured, Police Commissioner
E. P. Mulrooney declared that the two-gun desperado
was one of the most dangerous criminals ever encountered
in the history of New York. “He will kill,” said the
Commissioner, “at the drop of a feather.”
But how did “Two Gun” Crowley regard himself? We
know, because while the police were firing into his
apartment, he wrote a letter addressed “To whom it may
concern, ” And, as he wrote, the blood flowing from his
wounds left a crimson trail on the paper. In this letter
Crowley said: “Under my coat is a weary heart, but a
kind one - one that would do nobody any harm.”
A short time before this, Crowley had been having a
necking party with his girl friend on a country road out
on Long Island. Suddenly a policeman walked up to the
car and said: “Let me see your license.”
Without saying a word, Crowley drew his gun and cut
the policeman down with a shower of lead. As the dying
officer fell, Crowley leaped out of the car, grabbed the
officer’s revolver, and fired another bullet into the prostrate
body. And that was the killer who said: “Under my
coat is a weary heart, but a kind one - one that would do
nobody any harm.’
Crowley was sentenced to the electric chair. When he
arrived at the death house in Sing Sing, did he say, “This
is what I get for killing people”? No, he said: “This is
what I get for defending myself.”
The point of the story is this: “Two Gun” Crowley
didn’t blame himself for anything.
Is that an unusual attitude among criminals? If you
think so, listen to this:
“I have spent the best years of my life giving people
the lighter pleasures, helping them have a good time,
and all I get is abuse, the existence of a hunted man.”
That’s Al Capone speaking. Yes, America’s most notorious
Public Enemy- the most sinister gang leader who
ever shot up Chicago. Capone didn’t condemn himself.
He actually regarded himself as a public benefactor - an
unappreciated and misunderstood public benefactor.
And so did Dutch Schultz before he crumpled up
under gangster bullets in Newark. Dutch Schultz, one of
New York’s most notorious rats, said in a newspaper interview
that he was a public benefactor. And he believed
it.
I have had some interesting correspondence with
Lewis Lawes, who was warden of New York’s infamous
Sing Sing prison for many years, on this subject, and he
declared that “few of the criminals in Sing Sing regard
themselves as bad men. They are just as human as you
and I. So they rationalize, they explain. They can tell
you why they had to crack a safe or be quick on the
trigger finger. Most of them attempt by a form of reasoning,
fallacious or logical, to justify their antisocial acts
even to themselves, consequently stoutly maintaining
that they should never have been imprisoned at all.”
If Al Capone, “Two Gun” Crowley, Dutch Schultz,
and the desperate men and women behind prison walls
don’t blame themselves for anything - what about the
people with whom you and I come in contact?
John Wanamaker, founder of the stores that bear his
name, once confessed: “I learned thirty years ago that it
is foolish to scold. I have enough trouble overcoming my
own limitations without fretting over the fact that God
has not seen fit to distribute evenly the gift of intelligence.”
Wanamaker learned this lesson early, but I personally
had to blunder through this old world for a third of a
century before it even began to dawn upon me that
ninety-nine times out of a hundred, people don’t criticize
themselves for anything, no matter how wrong it
may be.
Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive
and usually makes him strive to justify himself.
Criticism is dangerous, because it wounds a person’s
precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and
arouses resentment.
B. F. Skinner, the world-famous psychologist, proved
through his experiments that an animal rewarded for
good behavior will learn much more rapidly and retain
what it learns far more effectively than an animal punished
for bad behavior. Later studies have shown that
the same applies to humans. By criticizing, we do not
make lasting changes and often incur resentment.
Hans Selye, another great psychologist, said, “As
much as we thirst for approval, we dread condemnation,”
The resentment that criticism engenders can demoralize
employees, family members and friends, and still
not correct the situation that has been condemned.
George B. Johnston of Enid, Oklahoma, is the safety
coordinator for an engineering company, One of his re-sponsibilities
is to see that employees wear their hard
hats whenever they are on the job in the field. He reported
that whenever he came across workers who were
not wearing hard hats, he would tell them with a lot of
authority of the regulation and that they must comply.
As a result he would get sullen acceptance, and often
after he left, the workers would remove the hats.
He decided to try a different approach. The next time
he found some of the workers not wearing their hard hat,
he asked if the hats were uncomfortable or did not fit
properly. Then he reminded the men in a pleasant tone
of voice that the hat was designed to protect them from
injury and suggested that it always be worn on the job.
The result was increased compliance with the regulation
with no resentment or emotional upset.
You will find examples of the futility of criticism bristling
on a thousand pages of history, Take, for example,
the famous quarrel between Theodore Roosevelt and
President Taft - a quarrel that split the Republican
party, put Woodrow Wilson in the White House, and
wrote bold, luminous lines across the First World War
and altered the flow of history. Let’s review the facts
quickly. When Theodore Roosevelt stepped out of the
White House in 1908, he supported Taft, who was
elected President. Then Theodore Roosevelt went off to
Africa to shoot lions. When he returned, he exploded.
He denounced Taft for his conservatism, tried to secure
the nomination for a third term himself, formed the Bull
Moose party, and all but demolished the G.O.P. In the
election that followed, William Howard Taft and the Republican
party carried only two states - Vermont and
Utah. The most disastrous defeat the party had ever
known.
Theodore Roosevelt blamed Taft, but did President
Taft blame himself? Of course not, With tears in his
eyes, Taft said: “I don’t see how I could have done any
differently from what I have.”
Who was to blame? Roosevelt or Taft? Frankly, I don’t
know, and I don’t care. The point I am trying to make is
that all of Theodore Roosevelt’s criticism didn’t persuade
Taft that he was wrong. It merely made Taft strive
to justify himself and to reiterate with tears in his eyes:
“I don’t see how I could have done any differently from
what I have.”
Or, take the Teapot Dome oil scandal. It kept the
newspapers ringing with indignation in the early 1920s.
It rocked the nation! Within the memory of living men,
nothing like it had ever happened before in American
public life. Here are the bare facts of the scandal: Albert
B. Fall, secretary of the interior in Harding’s cabinet,
was entrusted with the leasing of government oil reserves
at Elk Hill and Teapot Dome - oil reserves that
had been set aside for the future use of the Navy. Did
secretary Fall permit competitive bidding? No sir. He
handed the fat, juicy contract outright to his friend Edward
L. Doheny. And what did Doheny do? He gave
Secretary Fall what he was pleased to call a “loan” of
one hundred thousand dollars. Then, in a high-handed
manner, Secretary Fall ordered United States Marines
into the district to drive off competitors whose adjacent
wells were sapping oil out of the Elk Hill reserves.
These competitors, driven off their ground at the ends of
guns and bayonets, rushed into court - and blew the lid
off the Teapot Dome scandal. A stench arose so vile that
it ruined the Harding Administration, nauseated an entire
nation, threatened to wreck the Republican party,
and put Albert B. Fall behind prison bars.
Fall was condemned viciously - condemned as few
men in public life have ever been. Did he repent?
Never! Years later Herbert Hoover intimated in a public
speech that President Harding’s death had been due to
mental anxiety and worry because a friend had betrayed
him. When Mrs. Fall heard that, she sprang from her
chair, she wept, she shook her fists at fate and screamed:
&quot;What! Harding betrayed by Fall? No! My husband
never betrayed anyone. This whole house full of gold
would not tempt my husband to do wrong. He is the one
who has been betrayed and led to the slaughter and crucified.”
There you are; human nature in action, wrongdoers,
blaming everybody but themselves. We are all like that.
So when you and I are tempted to criticize someone
tomorrow, let’s remember Al Capone, “Two Gun”
Crowley and Albert Fall. Let’s realize that criticisms are
like homing pigeons. They always return home. Let’s
realize that the person we are going to correct and condemn
will probably justify himself or herself, and condemn
us in return; or, like the gentle Taft, will say: “I
don’t see how I could have done any differently from
what I have.”
On the morning of April 15, 1865, Abraham Lincoln
lay dying in a hall bedroom of a cheap lodging house
directly across the street from Ford’s Theater, where
John Wilkes Booth had shot him. Lincoln’s long body
lay stretched diagonally across a sagging bed that was
too short for him. A cheap reproduction of Rosa Bonheur’s
famous painting The Horse Fair hung above the
bed, and a dismal gas jet flickered yellow light.
As Lincoln lay dying, Secretary of War Stanton said,
“There lies the most perfect ruler of men that the world
has ever seen.”
What was the secret of Lincoln’s success in dealing
with people? I studied the life of Abraham Lincoln for
ten years and devoted all of three years to writing and
rewriting a book entitled Lincoln the Unknown. I believe
I have made as detailed and exhaustive a study of
Lincoln’s personality and home life as it is possible for
any being to make. I made a special study of Lincoln’s
method of dealing with people. Did he indulge in criticism?
Oh, yes. As a young man in the Pigeon Creek
Valley of Indiana, he not only criticized but he wrote
letters and poems ridiculing people and dropped these
letters on the country roads where they were sure to be
found. One of these letters aroused resentments that
burned for a lifetime.
Even after Lincoln had become a practicing lawyer in
Springfield, Illinois, he attacked his opponents openly
in letters published in the newspapers. But he did this
just once too often.
In the autumn of 1842 he ridiculed a vain, pugnacious
politician by the name of James Shields. Lincoln lamned
him through an anonymous letter published in
Springfield Journal. The town roared with laughter.
Shields, sensitive and proud, boiled with indignation.
He found out who wrote the letter, leaped on his horse,
started after Lincoln, and challenged him to fight a duel.
Lincoln didn’t want to fight. He was opposed to dueling,
but he couldn’t get out of it and save his honor. He was
given the choice of weapons. Since he had very long
arms, he chose cavalry broadswords and took lessons in
sword fighting from a West Point graduate; and, on the
appointed day, he and Shields met on a sandbar in the
Mississippi River, prepared to fight to the death; but, at
the last minute, their seconds interrupted and stopped
the duel.
That was the most lurid personal incident in Lincoln’s
life. It taught him an invaluable lesson in the art of dealing
with people. Never again did he write an insulting
letter. Never again did he ridicule anyone. And from that
time on, he almost never criticized anybody for anything.
Time after time, during the Civil War, Lincoln put a
new general at the head of the Army of the Potomac, and
each one in turn - McClellan, Pope, Burnside, Hooker,
Meade - blundered tragically and drove Lincoln to pacing
the floor in despair. Half the nation savagely condemned
these incompetent generals, but Lincoln, “with
malice toward none, with charity for all,” held his peace.
One of his favorite quotations was “Judge not, that ye be
not judged.”
And when Mrs. Lincoln and others spoke harshly of
the southern people, Lincoln replied: “Don’t criticize
them; they are just what we would be under similar
circumstances.”
Yet if any man ever had occasion to criticize, surely it
was Lincoln. Let’s take just one illustration:
The Battle of Gettysburg was fought during the first
three days of July 1863. During the night of July 4, Lee
began to retreat southward while storm clouds deluged
the country with rain. When Lee reached the Potomac
with his defeated army, he found a swollen, impassable
river in front of him, and a victorious Union Army behind
him. Lee was in a trap. He couldn’t escape. Lincoln
saw that. Here was a golden, heaven-sent opportunity-
the opportunity to capture Lee’s army and end the war
immediately. So, with a surge of high hope, Lincoln ordered
Meade not to call a council of war but to attack
Lee immediately. Lincoln telegraphed his orders and
then sent a special messenger to Meade demanding immediate
action.
And what did General Meade do? He did the very
opposite of what he was told to do. He called a council
of war in direct violation of Lincoln’s orders. He hesitated.
He procrastinated. He telegraphed all manner of
excuses. He refused point-blank to attack Lee. Finally
the waters receded and Lee escaped over the Potomac
with his forces.
Lincoln was furious, “ What does this mean?” Lincoln
cried to his son Robert. “Great God! What does this
mean? We had them within our grasp, and had only to
stretch forth our hands and they were ours; yet nothing
that I could say or do could make the army move. Under
the circumstances, almost any general could have defeated
Lee. If I had gone up there, I could have whipped
him myself.”
In bitter disappointment, Lincoln sat down and wrote
Meade this letter. And remember, at this period of his
life Lincoln was extremely conservative and restrained
in his phraseology. So this letter coming from Lincoln in
1863 was tantamount to the severest rebuke.
My dear General,
I do not believe you appreciate the magnitude of the misfortune
involved in Lee’s escape. He was within our easy
grasp, and to have closed upon him would, in connection
With our other late successes, have ended the war. As it is,
the war will be prolonged indefinitely. If you could not
safely attack Lee last Monday, how can you possibly do so
south of the river, when you can take with you very few-
no more than two-thirds of the force you then had in hand?
It would be unreasonable to expect and I do not expect that
you can now effect much. Your golden opportunity is gone,
and I am distressed immeasurably because of it.
What do you suppose Meade did when he read the
letter?
Meade never saw that letter. Lincoln never mailed it.
It was found among his papers after his death.
My guess is - and this is only a guess - that after writing
that letter, Lincoln looked out of the window and
said to himself, “Just a minute. Maybe I ought not to be
so hasty. It is easy enough for me to sit here in the quiet
of the White House and order Meade to attack; but if I
had been up at Gettysburg, and if I had seen as much
blood as Meade has seen during the last week, and if my
ears had been pierced with the screams and shrieks of
the wounded and dying, maybe I wouldn’t be so anxious
to attack either. If I had Meade’s timid temperament,
perhaps I would have done just what he had done. Anyhow,
it is water under the bridge now. If I send this
letter, it will relieve my feelings, but it will make Meade
try to justify himself. It will make him condemn me. It
will arouse hard feelings, impair all his further usefulness
as a commander, and perhaps force him to resign
from the army.”
So, as I have already said, Lincoln put the letter aside,
for he had learned by bitter experience that sharp criticisms
and rebukes almost invariably end in futility.
Theodore Roosevelt said that when he, as President,
was confronted with a perplexing problem, he used to
lean back and look up at a large painting of Lincoln
which hung above his desk in the White House and ask
himself, “What would Lincoln do if he were in my
shoes? How would he solve this problem?”
The next time we are tempted to admonish somebody,
/let’s pull a five-dollar bill out of our pocket, look at Lincoln’s
picture on the bill, and ask. “How would Lincoln
handle this problem if he had it?”
Mark Twain lost his temper occasionally and wrote
letters that turned the Paper brown. For example, he
once wrote to a man who had aroused his ire: “The thing
for you is a burial permit. You have only to speak and I
will see that you get it.” On another occasion he wrote
to an editor about a proofreader’s attempts to “improve
my spelling and punctuation.” He ordered: “Set the
matter according to my copy hereafter and see that the
proofreader retains his suggestions in the mush of his
decayed brain.”
The writing of these stinging letters made Mark Twain
feel better. They allowed him to blow off steam, and the
letters didn’t do any real harm, because Mark’s wife
secretly lifted them out of the mail. They were never
sent.
Do you know someone you would like to change and
regulate and improve? Good! That is fine. I am all in
favor of it, But why not begin on yourself? From a purely
selfish standpoint, that is a lot more profitable than
trying to improve others - yes, and a lot less dangerous.
“Don’t complain about the snow on your neighbor’s
roof,” said Confucius, “when your own doorstep is unclean.”
When I was still young and trying hard to impress
people, I wrote a foolish letter to Richard Harding
Davis, an author who once loomed large on the literary
horizon of America. I was preparing a magazine article
about authors, and I asked Davis to tell me about his
method of work. A few weeks earlier, I had received a
letter from someone with this notation at the bottom:
“Dictated but not read.” I was quite impressed. I felt
that the writer must be very big and busy and important.
I wasn’t the slightest bit busy, but I was eager to make
an impression on Richard Harding Davis, so I ended my
short note with the words: “Dictated but not read.”
He never troubled to answer the letter. He simply
returned it to me with this scribbled across the bottom:
“Your bad manners are exceeded only by your bad manners.”
True, I had blundered, and perhaps I deserved
this rebuke. But, being human, I resented it. I resented
it so sharply that when I read of the death of Richard
Harding Davis ten years later, the one thought that still
persisted in my mind - I am ashamed to admit - was the
hurt he had given me.
If you and I want to stir up a resentment tomorrow
that may rankle across the decades and endure until
death, just let us indulge in a little stinging criticism-
no matter how certain we are that it is justified.
When dealing with people, let us remember we are
not dealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing with
creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices
and motivated by pride and vanity.
Bitter criticism caused the sensitive Thomas Hardy,
one of the finest novelists ever to enrich English literature,
to give up forever the writing of fiction. Criticism
drove Thomas Chatterton, the English poet, to suicide.
Benjamin Franklin, tactless in his youth, became so
diplomatic, so adroit at handling people, that he was
made American Ambassador to France. The secret of his
success? “I will speak ill of no man,” he said, &quot; . . and
speak all the good I know of everybody.”
Any fool can criticize, condemn and complain - and
most fools do.
But it takes character and self-control to be under-standing
and forgiving.
“A great man shows his greatness,” said Carlyle, “by
the way he treats little men.”
Bob Hoover, a famous test pilot and frequent per-former
at air shows, was returning to his home in Los
Angeles from an air show in San Diego. As described in
the magazine Flight Operations, at three hundred feet
in the air, both engines suddenly stopped. By deft maneuvering
he managed to land the plane, but it was
badly damaged although nobody was hurt.
Hoover’s first act after the emergency landing was to
inspect the airplane’s fuel. Just as he suspected, the
World War II propeller plane he had been flying had
been fueled with jet fuel rather than gasoline.
Upon returning to the airport, he asked to see the mechanic
who had serviced his airplane. The young man
was sick with the agony of his mistake. Tears streamed
down his face as Hoover approached. He had just caused
the loss of a very expensive plane and could have caused
the loss of three lives as well.
You can imagine Hoover’s anger. One could anticipate
the tongue-lashing that this proud and precise pilot
would unleash for that carelessness. But Hoover didn’t
scold the mechanic; he didn’t even criticize him. Instead,
he put his big arm around the man’s shoulder and
said, “To show you I’m sure that you’ll never do this
again, I want you to service my F-51 tomorrow.”
Often parents are tempted to criticize their children.
You would expect me to say “don’t.” But I will not, I am
merely going to say, “Before you criticize them, read
one of the classics of American journalism, ‘Father Forgets.’ ”
It originally appeared as an editorial in the People&#x27;s
Home Journnl. We are reprinting it here with the
author’s permission, as condensed in the Reader’s Digest:
“Father Forgets” is one of those little pieces which-
dashed of in a moment of sincere feeling - strikes an
echoing chord in so many readers as to become a perenial
reprint favorite. Since its first appearance, “Father
Forgets&quot; has been reproduced, writes the author,
W, Livingston Larned, “in hundreds of magazines and
house organs, and in newspapers the country over. It has
been reprinted almost as extensively in many foreign
languages. I have given personal permission to thousands
who wished to read it from school, church, and
lecture platforms. It has been ‘on the air’ on countless
occasions and programs. Oddly enough, college periodicals
have used it, and high-school magazines. Sometimes
a little piece seems mysteriously to ‘click.’ This
one certainly did.”
FATHER FORGETS
W. Livingston Larned
Listen, son: I am saying this as you lie asleep, one little
paw crumpled under your cheek and the blond curls stickily
wet on your damp forehead. I have stolen into your room
alone. Just a few minutes ago, as I sat reading my paper
in the library, a stifling wave of remorse swept over me.
Guiltily I came to your bedside.
There are the things I was thinking, son: I had been cross
to you. I scolded you as you were dressing for school because
you gave your face merely a dab with a towel. I took
you to task for not cleaning your shoes. I called out angrily
when you threw some of your things on the floor.
At breakfast I found fault, too. You spilled things. You
gulped down your food. You put your elbows on the table.
You spread butter too thick on your bread. And as you
started off to play and I made for my train, you turned
and waved a hand and called, “Goodbye, Daddy!” and
I frowned, and said in reply, “Hold your shoulders
back!”
Then it began all over again in the late afternoon. As I
came up the road I spied you, down on your knees, playing
marbles. There were holes in your stockings. I humiliated
you before your boyfriends by marching you ahead of me to
the house. Stockings were expensive - and if you had to
buy them you would be more careful! Imagine that, son,
from a father!
Do you remember, later, when I was reading in the library,
how you came in timidly, with a sort of hurt look in
your eyes? When I glanced up over my paper, impatient at
the interruption, you hesitated at the door. “What is it you
want?” I snapped.
You said nothing, but ran across in one tempestuous
plunge, and threw your arms around my neck and kissed
me, and your small arms tightened with an affection that
God had set blooming in your heart and which even neglect
could not wither. And then you were gone, pattering up the
stairs.
Well, son, it was shortly afterwards that my paper slipped
from my hands and a terrible sickening fear came over me.
What has habit been doing to me? The habit of finding fault,
of reprimanding - this was my reward to you for being a
boy. It was not that I did not love you; it was that I expected
too much of youth. I was measuring you by the yardstick of
my own years.
And there was so much that was good and fine and true in
your character. The little heart of you was as big as the
dawn itself over the wide hills. This was shown by your
spontaneous impulse to rush in and kiss me good night.
Nothing else matters tonight, son. I have come to your bed-side
in the darkness, and I have knelt there, ashamed!
It is a feeble atonement; I know you would not understand
these things if I told them to you during your waking
hours. But tomorrow I will be a real daddy! I will chum
with you, and suffer when you suffer, and laugh when you
laugh. I will bite my tongue when impatient words come. I
will keep saying as if it were a ritual: “He is nothing but a
boy - a little boy!”
I am afraid I have visualized you as a man. Yet as I see
you now, son, crumpled and weary in your cot, I see that
you are still a baby. Yesterday you were in your mother’s
arms, your head on her shoulder. I have asked too much,
too much.
Instead of condemning people, let’s try to understand
them. Let’s try to figure out why they do what they do.
That’s a lot more profitable and intriguing than criticism;
and it breeds sympathy, tolerance and kindness. “To
know all is to forgive all.”
As Dr. Johnson said: “God himself, sir, does not propose
to judge man until the end of his days.”
Why should you and I?
PRINCIPLE 1Don’t criticize, condemn or complain.THE BIG SECRET OF DEALING WITHPEOPLEThere is only one way under high heaven to get anybody
to do anything. Did you ever stop to think of that? Yes,
just one way. And that is by making the other person want to do it.
Remember, there is no other way.
Of course, you can make someone want to give you his
watch by sticking a revolver in his ribs. YOU can make
your employees give you cooperation - until your back
is turned - by threatening to fire them. You can make a
child do what you want it to do by a whip or a threat. But
these crude methods have sharply undesirable repercussions.
The only way I can get you to do anything is by giving
you what you want.
What do you want?
Sigmund Freud said that everything you and I do
springs from two motives: the sex urge and the desire to
be great.
John Dewey, one of America’s most profound philosophers,
phrased it a bit differently. Dr. Dewey said that
the deepest urge in human nature is “the desire to be
important.&quot; Remember that phrase: “the desire to be
important.&quot; It is significant. You are going to hear a lot
about it in this book.
What do you want? Not many things, but the few
that you do wish, you crave with an insistence
that will not be denied. Some of the things most people
want include:</li><li>Health and the preservation of life.</li><li>Food.</li><li>Sleep.</li><li>Money and the things money will buy.</li><li>Life in the hereafter.</li><li>Sexual gratification.</li><li>The well-being of our children.</li><li>A feeling of importance.
Almost all these wants are usually gratified-all except
one. But there is one longing - almost as deep, almost
as imperious, as the desire for food or sleep - which
is seldom gratified. It is what Freud calls “the
desire to be great.” It is what Dewey calls the “desire to
be important.”
Lincoln once began a letter saying: “Everybody likes
a compliment.” William James said: &quot;The deepest principle
in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.&quot;
He didn’t speak, mind you, of the “wish” or the “desire”
or the “longing” to be appreciated. He said the &quot;craving”
to be appreciated.
Here is a gnawing and unfaltering human hunger, and
the rare individual who honestly satisfies this heart hunger
will hold people in the palm of his or her hand and
“even the undertaker will be sorry when he dies.”
The desire for a feeling of importance is one of the
chief distinguishing differences between mankind and
the animals. To illustrate: When I was a farm boy out in
Missouri, my father bred fine Duroc-Jersey hogs and .
pedigreed white - faced cattle. We used to exhibit our
hogs and white-faced cattle at the country fairs and live-stock
shows throughout the Middle West. We won first
prizes by the score. My father pinned his blue ribbons
on a sheet of white muslin, and when friends or visitors
came to the house, he would get out the long sheet of
muslin. He would hold one end and I would hold the
other while he exhibited the blue ribbons.
The hogs didn’t care about the ribbons they had won.
But Father did. These prizes gave him a feeling of importance.
If our ancestors hadn’t had this flaming urge for a feeling
of importance, civilization would have been impossible.
Without it, we should have been just about like
animals.
It was this desire for a feeling of importance that led
an uneducated, poverty-stricken grocery clerk to study
some law books he found in the bottom of a barrel of
household plunder that he had bought for fifty cents.
You have probably heard of this grocery clerk. His name
was Lincoln.
It was this desire for a feeling of importance that inspired
Dickens to write his immortal novels. This desire
inspired Sir Christoper Wren to design his symphonies
in stone. This desire made Rockefeller amass millions
that he never spent! And this same desire made the richest
family in your town build a house far too large for its
requirements.
This desire makes you want to wear the latest styles,
drive the latest cars, and talk about your brilliant children.
It is this desire that lures many boys and girls into
joining gangs and engaging in criminal activities. The
average young criminal, according to E. P. Mulrooney,
onetime police commissioner of New York, is filled with
ego, and his first request after arrest is for those lurid
newspapers that make him out a hero. The disagreeable
prospect of serving time seems remote so long as he can
gloat over his likeness sharing space with pictures of
sports figures, movie and TV stars and politicians.
If you tell me how you get your feeling of importance,
I’ll tell you what you are. That determines your character.
That is the most significant thing about you. For
example, John D. Rockefeller got his feeling of importance
by giving money to erect a modern hospital in
Peking, China, to care for millions of poor people whom
he had never seen and never would see. Dillinger, on
the other hand, got his feeling of importance by being a
bandit, a bank robber and killer. When the FBI agents
were hunting him, he dashed into a farmhouse up in
Minnesota and said, “I’m Dillinger!” He was proud of
the fact that he was Public Enemy Number One. “I’m
not going to hurt you, but I’m Dillinger!” he said.
Yes, the one significant difference between Dillinger
and Rockefeller is how they got their feeling of importance.
History sparkles with amusing examples of famous
people struggling for a feeling of importance. Even
George Washington wanted to be called “His Mightiness,
the President of the United States”; and Columbus
pleaded for the title “Admiral of the Ocean and Viceroy
of India.” Catherine the Great refused to open letters
that were not addressed to “Her Imperial Majesty”; and
Mrs. Lincoln, in the White House, turned upon Mrs.
Grant like a tigress and shouted, “How dare you be
seated in my presence until I invite you!”
Our millionaires helped finance Admiral Byrd’s expedition
to the Antarctic in 1928 with the understanding
that ranges of icy mountains would be named after them;
and Victor Hugo aspired to have nothing less than the
city of Paris renamed in his honor. Even Shakespeare,
mightiest of the mighty, tried to add luster to his name
by procuring a coat of arms for his family.
People sometimes became invalids in order to win
sympathy and attention, and get a feeling of importance.
For example, take Mrs. McKinley. She got a feeling of
importance by forcing her husband, the President of the
United States, to neglect important affairs of state while
he reclined on the bed beside her for hours at a time, his
arm about her, soothing her to sleep. She fed her gnawing
desire for attention by insisting that he remain with
her while she was having her teeth fixed, and once created
a stormy scene when he had to leave her alone with
the dentist while he kept an appointment with John
Hay, his secretary of state.
The writer Mary Roberts Rinehart once told me of a
bright, vigorous young woman who became an invalid
in order to get a feeling of importance. “One day,” said
Mrs. Rinehart, “this woman had been obliged to face
something, her age perhaps. The lonely years were
stretching ahead and there was little left for her to anticipate.
“She took to her bed; and for ten years her old mother
traveled to the third floor and back, carrying trays, nursing
her. Then one day the old mother, weary with service,
lay down and died. For some weeks, the invalid
languished; then she got up, put on her clothing, and
resumed living again.”
Some authorities declare that people may actually go
insane in order to find, in the dreamland of insanity, the
feeling of importance that has been denied them in the
harsh world of reality. There are more patients suffering
from mental diseases in the United States than from all
other diseases combined.
What is the cause of insanity?
Nobody can answer such a sweeping question, but we
know that certain diseases, such as syphilis, break down
and destroy the brain cells and result in insanity. In fact,
about one-half of all mental diseases can be attributed to
such physical causes as brain lesions, alcohol, toxins and
injuries. But the other half - and this is the appalling
part of the story - the other half of the people who go
insane apparently have nothing organically wrong with
their brain cells. In post-mortem examinations, when
their brain tissues are studied under the highest-powered
microscopes, these tissues are found to be apparently
just as healthy as yours and mine.
Why do these people go insane?
I put that question to the head physician of one of our
most important psychiatric hospitals. This doctor, who
has received the highest honors and the most coveted
awards for his knowledge of this subject, told me frankly
that he didn’t know why people went insane. Nobody
knows for sure But he did say that many people who go
insane find in insanity a feeling of importance that they
were unable to achieve in the world of reality. Then he
told me this story:
&quot;I have a patient right now whose marriage proved to
be a tragedy. She wanted love, sexual gratification, children
and social prestige, but life blasted all her hopes.
Her husband didn’t love her. He refused even to eat
with her and forced her to serve his meals in his room
upstairs. She had no children, no social standing. She
went insane; and, in her imagination, she divorced her
husband and resumed her maiden name. She now believes
she has married into English aristocracy, and she
insists on being called Lady Smith.
“And as for children, she imagines now that she has
had a new child every night. Each time I call on her she
says: ‘Doctor, I had a baby last night.’ &quot;
Life once wrecked all her dream ships on the sharp
rocks of reality; but in the sunny, fantasy isles of insanity,
all her barkentines race into port with canvas billowing
and winds singing through the masts.
&quot; Tragic? Oh, I don’t know. Her physician said to me:
If I could stretch out my hand and restore her sanity, I
wouldn’t do it. She’s much happier as she is.&quot;
If some people are so hungry for a feeling of importance
that they actually go insane to get it, imagine what
miracle you and I can achieve by giving people honest
appreciation this side of insanity.
One of the first people in American business to be
paid a salary of over a million dollars a year (when there
was no income tax and a person earning fifty dollars a
week was considered well off) was Charles Schwab, He
had been picked by Andrew Carnegie to become the
first president of the newly formed United States Steel
Company in 1921, when Schwab was only thirty-eight
years old. (Schwab later left U.S. Steel to take over the
then-troubled Bethlehem Steel Company, and he rebuilt
it into one of the most profitable companies in America.)
Why did Andrew Carnegie pay a million dollars a
year, or more than three thousand dollars a day, to
Charles Schwab? Why? Because Schwab was a genius?
No. Because he knew more about the manufacture of
steel than other people? Nonsense. Charles Schwab told
me himself that he had many men working for him who
knew more about the manufacture of steel than he did.
Schwab says that he was paid this salary largely because
of his ability to deal with people. I asked him how
he did it. Here is his secret set down in his own words</li></ol><ul><li>words that ought to be cast in eternal bronze and hung
in every home and school, every shop and office in the
land - words that children ought to memorize instead of
wasting their time memorizing the conjugation of Latin
verbs or the amount of the annual rainfall in Brazil - words
that will all but transform your life and mine if we
will only live them:
“I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my
people,” said Schwab, “the greatest asset I possess, and
the way to develop the best that is in a person is by
appreciation and encouragement.
“There is nothing else that so kills the ambitions of a
person as criticisms from superiors. I never criticize any-
one. I believe in giving a person incentive to work. So I
am anxious to praise but loath to find fault. If I like anything,
I am hearty in my approbation and lavish in my
praise. &quot;
That is what Schwab did. But what do average people
do? The exact opposite. If they don’t like a thing, they
bawl out their subordinates; if they do like it, they say
nothing. As the old couplet says: “Once I did bad and
that I heard ever/Twice I did good, but that I heard
never.”
“In my wide association in life, meeting with many
and great people in various parts of the world,” Schwab
declared, “I have yet to find the person, however great
or exalted his station, who did not do better work and
put forth greater effort under a spirit of approval than he
would ever do under a spirit of criticism.”
That he said, frankly, was one of the outstanding reasons
for the phenomenal success of Andrew Carnegie.
Carnegie praised his associates publicly as well as pr-vately.
Carnegie wanted to praise his assistants even on his
tombstone. He wrote an epitaph for himself which read:
“Here lies one who knew how to get around him men
who were cleverer than himself:”
Sincere appreciation was one of the secrets of the first
John D. Rockefeller’s success in handling men. For example,
when one of his partners, Edward T. Bedford,
lost a million dollars for the firm by a bad buy in South
America, John D. might have criticized; but he knew
Bedford had done his best - and the incident was
closed. So Rockefeller found something to praise; he
congratulated Bedford because he had been able to save
60 percent of the money he had invested. “That’s splendid,&quot;
said Rockefeller. “We don’t always do as well as
that upstairs.”
I have among my clippings a story that I know never
happened, but it illustrates a truth, so I’ll repeat it:
According to this silly story, a farm woman, at the end
of a heavy day’s work, set before her menfolks a heaping
pile of hay. And when they indignantly demanded
whether she had gone crazy, she replied: “Why, how
did I know you’d notice? I’ve been cooking for you men
for the last twenty years and in all that time I ain’t heard
no word to let me know you wasn’t just eating hay.”
When a study was made a few years ago on runaway
wives, what do you think was discovered to be the main
reason wives ran away? It was “lack of appreciation.”
And I’d bet that a similar study made of runaway husbands
would come out the same way. We often take our
spouses so much for granted that we never let them
know we appreciate them.
A member of one of our classes told of a request made
by his wife. She and a group of other women in her
church were involved in a self-improvement program.
She asked her husband to help her by listing six things
he believed she could do to help her become a better
wife. He reported to the class: “I was surprised by such
a request. Frankly, it would have been easy for me to list
six things I would like to change about her - my heavens,
she could have listed a thousand things she would
like to change about me - but I didn’t. I said to her, ‘Let
me think about it and give you an answer in the morning.’
“The next morning I got up very early and called the
florist and had them send six red roses to my wife with a
note saying: ‘I can’t think of six things I would like to
change about you. I love you the way you are.’
“When I arrived at home that evening, who do you
think greeted me at the door: That’s right. My wife! She
was almost in tears. Needless to say, I was extremely
glad I had not criticized her as she had requested.
“The following Sunday at church, after she had reported
the results of her assignment, several women
with whom she had been studying came up to me and
said, ‘That was the most considerate thing I have ever
heard.’ It was then I realized the power of appreciation.”
Florenz Ziegfeld, the most spectacular producer who
ever dazzled Broadway, gained his reputation by his
subtle ability to “glorify the American girl.” Time after
time, he took drab little creatures that no one ever
looked at twice and transformed them on the stage into
glamorous visions of mystery and seduction. Knowing
the value of appreciation and confidence, he made
women feel beautiful by the sheer power of his gallantry
and consideration. He was practical: he raised the salary
of chorus girls from thirty dollars a week to as high as
one hundred and seventy-five. And he was also chivalrous;
on opening night at the Follies, he sent telegrams
to the stars in the cast, and he deluged every chorus girl
in the show with American Beauty roses.
I once succumbed to the fad of fasting and went for six
days and nights without eating. It wasn’t difficult. I was
less hungry at the end of the sixth day than I was at the
end of the second. Yet I know, as you know, people who
would think they had committed a crime if they let their
families or employees go for six days without food; but
they will let them go for six days, and six weeks, and
sometimes sixty years without giving them the hearty
appreciation that they crave almost as much as they
crave food.
When Alfred Lunt, one of the great actors of his time,
played the leading role in Reunion in Vienna,he said,
“There is nothing I need so much as nourishment for my
self-esteem.”
We nourish the bodies of our children and friends and
employees, but how seldom do we nourish their selfesteem?
We provide them with roast beef and potatoes
to build energy, but we neglect to give them kind words
of appreciation that would sing in their memories for
years like the music of the morning stars.
Paul Harvey, in one of his radio broadcasts, “The Rest
of the Story,” told how showing sincere appreciation can
change a person’s life. He reported that years ago a
teacher in Detroit asked Stevie Morris to help her find a
mouse that was lost in the classroom. You see, she appreciated
the fact that nature had given Stevie something
no one else in the room had. Nature had given Stevie a
remarkable pair of ears to compensate for his blind eyes.
But this was really the first time Stevie had been shown
appreciation for those talented ears. Now, years later, he
says that this act of appreciation was the beginning of a
new life. You see, from that time on he developed his
gift of hearing and went on to become, under the stage
name of Stevie Wonder, one of the great pop singers and
and songwriters of the seventies.*</li></ul><ul><li>Paul Aurandt, Paul Harvey’s The Rest the Story (New York: Doubleday,

Some readers are saying right now as they read these
lines: “Oh, phooey! Flattery! Bear oil! I’ve tried that
stuff. It doesn’t work - not with intelligent people.”
Of course flattery seldom works with discerning people.
It is shallow, selfish and insincere. It ought to fail
and it usually does. True, some people are so hungry, so
thirsty, for appreciation that they will swallow anything,
just as a starving man will eat grass and fishworms.
Even Queen Victoria was susceptible to flattery.
Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli confessed that he put
it on thick in dealing with the Queen. To use his exact
words, he said he “spread it on with a trowel.” But Disraeli
was one of the most polished, deft and adroit men
who ever ruled the far-flung British Empire. He was a
genius in his line. What would work for him wouldn’t
necessarily work for you and me. In the long run, flattery
will do you more harm than good. Flattery is counterfeit,
and like counterfeit money, it will eventually get you
into trouble if you pass it to someone else.
The difference between appreciation and flattery?
That is simple. One is sincere and the other insincere.
One comes from the heart out; the other from the teeth
out. One is unselfish; the other selfish. One is universally
admired; the other universally condemned.
I recently saw a bust of Mexican hero General Alvaro
Obregon in the Chapultepec palace in Mexico City.
Below the bust are carved these wise words from General
Obregon’s philosophy: “Don’t be afraid of enemies
who attack you. Be afraid of the friends who flatter you.”
No! No! No! I am not suggesting flattery! Far from it.
I’m talking about a new way of life. Let me repeat. Iam
talking about a new way of life.
King George V had a set of six maxims displayed on
the walls of his study at Buckingham Palace. One of
these maxims said: “Teach me neither to proffer nor receive
cheap praise.” That’s all flattery is - cheap praise.
I once read a definition of flattery that may be worth
repeating: “Flattery is telling the other person precisely
what he thinks about himself.”
“Use what language you will,” said Ralph Waldo
Emerson, “you can never say anything but what you
are .&quot;
If all we had to do was flatter, everybody would catch
on and we should all be experts in human relations.
When we are not engaged in thinking about some definite
problem, we usually spend about 95 percent of our
time thinking about ourselves. Now, if we stop thinking
about ourselves for a while and begin to think of the
other person’s good points, we won’t have to resort to
flattery so cheap and false that it can be spotted almost
before it is out of the mouth,
One of the most neglected virtues of our daily existence
is appreciation, Somehow, we neglect to praise
our son or daughter when he or she brings home a good
report card, and we fail to encourage our children when
they first succeed in baking a cake or building a birdhouse.
Nothing pleases children more than this kind of
parental interest and approval.
The next time you enjoy filet mignon at the club, send
word to the chef that it was excellently prepared, and
when a tired salesperson shows you unusual courtesy,
please mention it.
Every minister, lecturer and public speaker knows the
discouragement of pouring himself or herself out to an
audience and not receiving a single ripple of appreciative
comment. What applies to professionals applies
doubly to workers in offices, shops and factories and our
families and friends. In our interpersonal relations we
should never forget that all our associates are human
beings and hunger for appreciation. It is the legal tender
that all souls enjoy.
Try leaving a friendly trail of little sparks of gratitude
on your daily trips. You will be surprised how they will
set small flames of friendship that will be rose beacons
on your next visit.
Pamela Dunham of New Fairfield, Connecticut, had
among her responsibilities on her job the supervision of
a janitor who was doing a very poor job. The other employees
would jeer at him and litter the hallways to show
him what a bad job he was doing. It was so bad, productive
time was being lost in the shop.
Without success, Pam tried various ways to motivate
this person. She noticed that occasionally he did a particularly
good piece of work. She made a point to praise
him for it in front of the other people. Each day the job
he did all around got better, and pretty soon he started
doing all his work efficiently. Now he does an excellent
job and other people give him appreciation and recognition.
Honest appreciation got results where criticism
and ridicule failed.
Hurting people not only does not change them, it is
never called for. There is an old saying that I have cut
out and pasted on my mirror where I cannot help but
see it every day:
I shall pass this way but once; any good, therefore, that I
can do or any kindness that I can show to any human being,
let me do it now. Let me not defer nor neglect it, for I shall
not pass this way again.
Emerson said: “Every man I meet is my superior in
some way, In that, I learn of him.”
If that was true of Emerson, isn’t it likely to be a thousand
times more true of you and me? Let’s cease thinking
of our accomplishments, our wants. Let’s try to figure
out the other person’s good points. Then forget flattery.
Give honest, sincere appreciation. Be “hearty in your
approbation and lavish in your praise,” and people will
cherish your words and treasure them and repeat them
over a lifetime - repeat them years after you have forgotten
them.
PRINCIPLE 2Give honest and sincere appreciation.“HE WHO CAN DO THIS HAS THEWHOLE WORLD WITH HIM.HE WHO CANNOT WALKSA LONELY WAY”
I often went fishing up in Maine during the summer.
Personally I am very fond of strawberries and cream, but
I have found that for some strange reason, fish prefer
worms. So when I went fishing, I didn’t think about what
I wanted. I thought about what they wanted. I didn’t
bait the hook with strawberries and cream. Rather, I dangled
a worm or a grasshopper in front of the fish and
said: “Wouldn’t you like to have that?”
Why not use the same common sense when fishing for
people?
That is what Lloyd George, Great Britain’s Prime Minister
during World War I, did. When someone asked him
how he managed to stay in power after the other wartime
leaders - Wilson, Orlando and Clemenceau - had been
forgotten, he replied that if his staying on top might be
attributed to any one thing, it would be to his having
learned that it was necessary to bait the hook to suit the
fish .
Why talk about what we want? That is childish. Absurd.
Of course, you are interested in what you want.
You are eternally interested in it. But no one else is. The
rest of us are just like you: we are interested in what we
want.So the only way cm earth to influence other people is
to talk about what they want and show them how to get
it.
Remember that tomorrow when you are trying to get
somebody to do something. If, for example, you don’t
want your children to smoke, don’t preach at them, and
don’t talk about what you want; but show them that cigarettes
may keep them from making the basketball team
or winning the hundred-yard dash.
This is a good thing to remember regardless of
whether you are dealing with children or calves or chimpanzees.
For example: one day Ralph Waldo Emerson
and his son tried to get a calf into the barn. But they
made the common mistake of thinking only of what they
wanted: Emerson pushed and his son pulled. But the
calf was doing just what they were doing; he was thinking
only of what he wanted; so he stiffened his legs and
stubbornly refused to leave the pasture. The Irish housemaid
saw their predicament. She couldn’t write essays
and books; but, on this occasion at least, she had more
horse sense, or calf sense, than Emerson had. She
thought of what the calf wanted; so she put her maternal
finger in the calf’s mouth and let the calf suck her finger
as she gently led him into the barn.
Every act you have ever performed since the day you
were born was performed because you wanted something.
How about the time you gave a large contribution
to the Red Cross? Yes, that is no exception to the rule.
You gave the Red Cross the donation because you
wanted to lend a helping hand; you wanted to do a beautiful,
unselfish, divine act. &quot; Inasmuch as ye have done it
unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done
it unto me.”
If you hadn’t wanted that feeling more than you
wanted your money, you would not have made the contribution.
Of course, you might have made the contribution
because you were ashamed to refuse or because a
customer asked you to do it. But one thing is certain. You
made the contribution because you wanted something.
Harry A, Overstreet in his illuminating book Influencing
Human Behavior said; “Action springs out of what
we fundamentally desire . . . and the best piece of advice
which can be given to would-be persuaders,
whether in business, in the home, in the school, in politics,
is: First, arouse in the other person an eager want.
He who can do this has the whole world with him. He
who cannot walks a lonely way.”
Andrew Carnegie, the poverty-stricken Scotch lad
who started to work at two cents an hour and finally gave
away $365 million, learned early in life that the only
way to influence people is to talk in terms of what the
other person wants. He attended school only four years;
yet he learned how to handle people.
To illustrate: His sister-in-law was worried sick over
her two boys. They were at Yale, and they were so busy
with their own affairs that they neglected to write home
and paid no attention whatever to their mother’s frantic
letters.
Then Carnegie offered to wager a hundred dollars that
he could get an answer by return mail, without even
asking for it. Someone called his bet; so he wrote his
nephews a chatty letter, mentioning casually in a post-script
that he was sending each one a five-dollar bill.
He neglected, however, to enclose the money.
Back came replies by return mail thanking “Dear
Uncle Andrew” for his kind note and-you can finish
the sentence yourself.
Another example of persuading comes from Stan
Novak of Cleveland, Ohio, a participant in our course.
Stan came home from work one evening to find his
youngest son, Tim, kicking and screaming on the living
room floor. He was to start kindergarten the next day and
was protesting that he would not go. Stan’s normal reaction
would have been to banish the child to his room
and tell him he’d just better make up his mind to go. He
had no choice. But tonight, recognizing that this would
not really help Tim start kindergarten in the best frame
of mind, Stan sat down and thought, “If I were Tim, why
would I be excited about going to kindergarten?” He
and his wife made a list of all the fun things Tim would
do such as finger painting, singing songs, making new
friends. Then they put them into action. “We all started
finger-painting on the kitchen table-my wife, Lil, my
other son Bob, and myself, all having fun. Soon Tim was
peeping around the corner. Next he was begging to participate.
‘Oh, no! You have to go to kindergarten first to
learn how to finger-paint.’ With all the enthusiasm I
could muster I went through the list talking in terms he
could understand-telling him all the fun he would
have in kindergarten. The next morning, I thought I was
the first one up. I went downstairs and found Tim sitting
sound asleep in the living room chair. ‘What are you
doing here?’ I asked. ‘I’m waiting to go to kindergarten.
I don’t want to be late.’ The enthusiasm of our entire
family had aroused in Tim an eager want that no amount
of discussion or threat could have possibly accomplished.”
Tomorrow you may want to persuade somebody to do
something. Before you speak, pause and ask yourself:
“How can I make this person want to do it?”
That question will stop us from rushing into a situation
heedlessly, with futile chatter about our desires.
At one time I rented the grand ballroom of a certain
New York hotel for twenty nights in each season in order
to hold a series of lectures.
At the beginning of one season, I was suddenly informed
that I should have to pay almost three times as
much rent as formerly. This news reached me after the
tickets had been printed and distributed and all announcements
had been made.
Naturally, I didn’t want to pay the increase, but what
was the use of talking to the hotel about what I wanted?
They were interested only in what they wanted. So a
couple of days later I went to see the manager.
&quot;I was a bit shocked when I got your letter,” I said,
“but I don’t blame you at all. If I had been in your position,
I should probably have written a similar letter myself.
Your duty as the manager of the hotel is to make all
the profit possible. If you don’t do that, you will be fired
and you ought to be fired. Now, let’s take a piece of
paper and write down the advantages and the disadvantages
that will accrue to you, if you insist on this increase
in rent.”
Then I took a letterhead and ran a line through the
center and headed one column “Advantages” and the
other column “Disadvantages.”
I wrote down under the head “Advantages” these
words: “Ballroom free.” Then I went on to say: “You
will have the advantage of having the ballroom free to
rent for dances and conventions. That is a big advantage,
for affairs like that will pay you much more than you can
get for a series of lectures. If I tie your ballroom up
for twenty nights during the course of the season, it is
sure to mean a loss of some very profitable business to
you.
“Now, let’s ‘consider the disadvantages. First, instead
of increasing your income from me, you are going to
decrease it. In fact, you are going to wipe it out because
I cannot pay the rent you are asking. I shall be forced to
hold these lectures at some other place.
“There’s another disadvantage to you also. These lectures
attract crowds of educated and cultured people to
your hotel. That is good advertising for you, isn’t it? In
fact, if you spent five thousand dollars advertising in the
newspapers, you couldn’t bring as many people to look
at your hotel as I can bring by these lectures. That is
worth a lot to a hotel, isn’t it?”
As I talked, I wrote these two “disadvantages” under
the proper heading, and handed the sheet of paper to
the manager, saying: &quot;I wish you would carefully consider
both the advantages and disadvantages that are
going to accrue to you and then give me your final decision.”
I received a letter the next day, informing me that my
rent would be increased only 50 percent instead of 300
percent.
Mind you, I got this reduction without saying a word
about what I wanted. I talked all the time about what
the other person wanted and how he could get it.
Suppose I had done the human, natural thing; suppose
I had stormed into his office and said, “What do you
mean by raising my rent three hundred percent when
you know the tickets have been printed and the announcements
made? Three hundred percent! Ridiculous!
Absurd! I won’t pay it!”
What would have happened then? An argument would
have begun to steam and boil and sputter - and you
know how arguments end. Even if I had convinced him
that he was wrong, his pride would have made it difficult
for him to back down and give in.
Here is one of the best bits of advice ever given about
the fine art of human relationships. “If there is any one
secret of success,” said Henry Ford, “it lies in the ability
to get the other person’s point of view and see things
from that person’s angle as well as from your own.”
That is so good, I want to repeat it:&quot;If there is any one
secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other
person&#x27;s point of view and see things from that person’s
angle as well as from your own.”
That is so simple, so obvious, that anyone ought to see
the truth of it at a glance; yet 90 percent of the people
on this earth ignore it 90 percent of the time.
An example? Look at the letters that come across your
desk tomorrow morning, and you will find that most of
them violate this important canon of common sense.
Take this one, a letter written by the head of the radio
department of an advertising agency with offices scattered
across the continent. This letter was sent to the
managers of local radio stations throughout the country.
(I have set down, in brackets, my reactions to each paragraph.)
Mr. John Blank,
Blankville,
Indiana
Dear Mr. Blank:
The ------ company desires to retain its position in advertising
agency leadership in the radio field.
<!-- -->[Who cares what your company desires? I am worried
about my own problems. The bank is foreclosing the
mortage on my house, the bugs are destroying the hollyhocks,
the stock market tumbled yesterday. I missed
the eight-fifteen this morning, I wasn’t invited to the
Jones’s dance last night, the doctor tells me I have high
blood pressure and neuritis and dandruff. And then what
happens? I come down to the office this morning worried,
open my mail and here is some little whippersnapper
off in New York yapping about what his company
wants. Bah! If he only realized what sort of impression
his letter makes, he would get out of the advertising
business and start manufacturing sheep dip.]<!-- -->
This agency’s national advertising accounts were the
bulwark of the network. Our subsequent clearances of
station time have kept us at the top of agencies year after
year.
<!-- -->[You are big and rich and right at the top, are you? So
what? I don’t give two whoops in Hades if you are as big
as General Motors and General Electric and the General
Staff of the U.S. Army all combined. If you had as much
sense as a half-witted hummingbird, you would realize
that I am interested in how big I am - not how big you
are. All this talk about your enormous success makes me
feel small and unimportant.]<!-- -->
We desire to service our accounts with the last word on
radio station information
<!-- -->[You desire! You desire. You unmitigated ass. I’m not
interested in what you desire or what the President of
the United States desires. Let me tell you once and for
all that I am interested in what I desire - and you
haven’t said a word about that yet in this absurd letter of
yours .]<!-- -->
Will you, therefore, put the ---------- company on your
preferred list for weekly station information - every single
detail that will be useful to an agency in intelligently booking
time.
[“Preferred list.” You have your nerve! You make me
feel insignificant by your big talk about your company</li></ul><ul><li>nd then you ask me to put you on a “preferred” list,
and you don’t even say “please” when you ask it.]
A prompt acknowledgment of this letter, giving us your
latest “doings,” will be mutually helpful.
<!-- -->[You fool! You mail me a cheap form letter - a letter
scattered far and wide like the autumn leaves - and you
have the gall to ask me, when I am worried about the
mortgage and the hollyhocks and my blood pressure, to
sit down and dictate a personal note acknowledging your
form letter - and you ask me to do it “promptly.” What
do you mean, “promptly”.? Don’t you know I am just as
busy as you are - or, at least, I like to think I am. And
while we are on the subject, who gave you the lordly
right to order me around? . . . You say it will be “mutually
helpful.” At last, at last, you have begun to see my
viewpoint. But you are vague about how it will be to my
advantage.]<!-- -->
Very truly yours,
John Doe
Manager Radio Department
P.S. The enclosed reprint from the Blankville Journal will
be of interest to you, and you may want to broadcast it over
your station.
<!-- -->[Finally, down here in the postscript, you mention
something that may help me solve one of my problems.
Why didn’t you begin your letter with - but what’s the
use? Any advertising man who is guilty of perpetrating
such drivel as you have sent me has something wrong
with his medulla oblongata. You don’t need a letter giving
our latest doings. What you need is a quart of iodine
in your thyroid gland.]<!-- -->
Now, if people who devote their lives to advertising
and who pose as experts in the art of influencing people
to buy - if they write a letter like that, what can we expect
from the butcher and baker or the auto mechanic?
Here is another letter, written by the superintendent
of a large freight terminal to a student of this course,
Edward Vermylen. What effect did this letter have on
the man to whom it was addressed? Read it and then I&#x27;ll
tell you.
A. Zerega’s Sons, Inc.
28 Front St.
Brooklyn, N.Y. 11201
Attention: Mr. Edward Vermylen
Gentlemen:
The operations at our outbound-rail-receiving station are
handicapped because a material percentage of the total
business is delivered us in the late afternoon. This condition
results in congestion, overtime on the part of our forces,
delays to trucks, and in some cases delays to freight. On
November 10, we received from your company a lot of 510
pieces, which reached here at 4:20 P.M.
We solicit your cooperation toward overcoming the undesirable
effects arising from late receipt of freight. May we
ask that, on days on which you ship the volume which was
received on the above date, effort be made either to get the
truck here earlier or to deliver us part of the freight during
the morning?
The advantage that would accrue to you under such an
arrangement would be that of more expeditious discharge
of your trucks and the assurance that your business would
go forward on the date of its receipt.
Very truly yours,
J----- B ----- Supt.
After reading this letter, Mr. Vermylen, sales manager
for A. Zerega’s Sons, Inc., sent it to me with the following
comment:
This letter had the reverse effect from that which was
intended. The letter begins by describing the Terminal’s
difficulties, in which we are not interested, generally speaking.
Our cooperation is then requested without any thought
as to whether it would inconvenience us, and then, finally,
in the last paragraph, the fact is mentioned that if we do
cooperate it will mean more expeditious discharge of our
trucks with the assurance that our freight will go forward on
the date of its receipt.
In other words, that in which we are most interested is
mentioned last and the whole effect is one of raising a spirit
of antagonism rather than of cooperation.
Let’s see if we can’t rewrite and improve this letter.
Let’s not waste any time talking about our problems. As
Henry Ford admonishes, let’s “get the other person’s
point of view and see things from his or her angle, as
well as from our own.”
Here is one way of revising the letter. It may not be
the best way, but isn’t it an improvement?
Mr. Edward Vermylen
% A. Zerega’s Sons, Inc.
28 Front St.
Brooklyn, N.Y. 11201
Dear Mr. Vermylen:
Your company has been one of our good customers for
fourteen years. Naturally, we are very grateful for your patronage
and are eager to give you the speedy, efficient service
you deserve. However, we regret to say that it isn’t
possible for us to do that when your trucks bring us a large
shipment late in the afternoon, as they did on November</li></ul><ol start="10"><li>Why? Because many other customers make late afternoon
deliveries also. Naturally, that causes congestion. That
means your trucks are held up unavoidably at the pier and
sometimes even your freight is delayed.
That’s bad, but it can be avoided. If you make your deliveries
at the pier in the morning when possible, your trucks
will be able to keep moving, your freight will get immediate
attention, and our workers will get home early at night to
enjoy a dinner of the delicious macaroni and noodles that
you manufacture.
Regardless of when your shipments arrive, we shall always
cheerfully do all in our power to serve you promptly.
You are busy. Please don’t trouble to answer this note.
Yours truly,
J----- B-----, supt.
Barbara Anderson, who worked in a bank in New
York, desired to move to Phoenix, Arizona, because of
the health of her son. Using the principles she had
learned in our course, she wrote the following letter to
twelve banks in Phoenix:
Dear Sir:
My ten years of bank experience should be of interest to
a rapidly growing bank like yours.
In various capacities in bank operations with the Bankers
Trust Company in New York, leading to my present assignment
as Branch Manager, I have acquired skills in all
phases of banking including depositor relations, credits,
loans and administration.
I will be relocating to Phoenix in May and I am sure I can
contribute to your growth and profit. I will be in Phoenix
the week of April 3 and would appreciate the opportunity
to show you how I can help your bank meet its goals.
Sincerely,
Barbara L. Anderson
Do you think Mrs. Anderson received any response
from that letter? Eleven of the twelve banks invited her
to be interviewed, and she had a choice of which bank’s
offer to accept. Why? Mrs. Anderson did not state what
she wanted, but wrote in the letter how she could help
them, and focused on their wants, not her own.
Thousands of salespeople are pounding the pavements
today, tired, discouraged and underpaid. Why?
Because they are always thinking only of what they
want. They don’t realize that neither you nor I want to
buy anything. If we did, we would go out and buy it. But
both of us are eternally interested in solving our problems.
And if salespeople can show us how their services
or merchandise will help us solve our problems, they
won’t need to sell us. We’ll buy. And customers like to
feel that they are buying - not being sold.
Yet many salespeople spend a lifetime in selling without
seeing things from the customer’s angle. For example,
for many years I lived in Forest Hills, a little
community of private homes in the center of Greater
New York. One day as I was rushing to the station, I
chanced to meet a real-estate operator who had bought
and sold property in that area for many years. He knew
Forest Hills well, so I hurriedly asked him whether or
not my stucco house was built with metal lath or hollow
tile. He said he didn’t know and told me what I already
knew - that I could find out by calling the Forest Hills
Garden Association. The following morning, I received
a letter from him. Did he give me the information I
wanted? He could have gotten it in sixty seconds by a
telephone call. But he didn’t. He told me again that I
could get it by telephoning, and then asked me to let
him handle my insurance.
He was not interested in helping me. He was interested
only in helping himself.
J. Howard Lucas of Birmingham, Alabama, tells how
two salespeople from the same company handled the
same type of situation, He reported:
“Several years ago I was on the management team of
a small company. Headquartered near us was the district
office of a large insurance company. Their agents were
assigned territories, and our company was assigned to
two agents, whom I shall refer to as Carl and John.
“One morning, Carl dropped by our office and casually
mentioned that his company had just introduced a
new life insurance policy for executives and thought we
might be interested later on and he would get back to us
when he had more information on it.
“The same day, John saw us on the sidewalk while
returning from a coffee break, and he shouted: ‘Hey
Luke, hold up, I have some great news for you fellows.’
He hurried over and very excitedly told us about an executive
life insurance policy his company had introduced
that very day. (It was the same policy that Carl
had casually mentioned.) He wanted us to have one of
the first issued. He gave us a few important facts about
the coverage and ended saying, ‘The policy is so new,
I’m going to have someone from the home office come
out tomorrow and explain it. Now, in the meantime, let’s
get the applications signed and on the way so he can
have more information to work with.’ His enthusiasm
aroused in us an eager want for this policy even though
we still did not have details, When they were made
available to us, they confirmed John’s initial understanding
of the policy, and he not only sold each of us a policy,
but later doubled our coverage.
“Carl could have had those sales, but he made no effort
to arouse in us any desire for the policies.”
The world is full of people who are grabbing and self-seeking.
So the rare individual who unselfishly tries to
serve others has an enormous advantage. He has little
competition. Owen D. Young, a noted lawyer and one of
America’s great business leaders, once said: “People
who can put themselves in the place of other people
who can understand the workings of their minds, need
never worry about what the future has in store for
them.”
If out of reading this book you get just one thing - an
increased tendency to think always in terms of other
people’s point of view, and see things from their angle</li></ol><ul><li>if you get that one thing out of this book, it may
easily prove to be one of the building blocks of your
career.
Looking at the other person’s point of view and arousing
in him an eager want for something is not to be
construed as manipulating that person so that he will do
something that is only for your benefit and his detriment.
Each party should gain from the negotiation. In the letters
to Mr. Vermylen, both the sender and the receiver
of the correspondence gained by implementing what
was suggested. Both the bank and Mrs. Anderson won
by her letter in that the bank obtained a valuable employee
and Mrs. Anderson a suitable job. And in the
example of John’s sale of insurance to Mr. Lucas, both
gained through this transaction.
Another example in which everybody gains through
this principle of arousing an eager want comes from Michael
E. Whidden of Warwick, Rhode Island, who is a
territory salesman for the Shell Oil Company. Mike
wanted to become the Number One salesperson in his
district, but one service station was holding him back. It
was run by an older man who could not be motivated to
clean up his station. It was in such poor shape that sales
were declining significantly.
This manager would not listen to any of Mike’s pleas
to upgrade the station. After many exhortations and
heart-to-heart talks - all of which had no impact - Mike
decided to invite the manager to visit the newest Shell
station in his territory.
The manager was so impressed by the facilities at the
new station that when Mike visited him the next time,
his station was cleaned up and had recorded a sales increase.
This enabled Mike to reach the Number One
spot in his district. All his talking and discussion hadn’t
helped, but by arousing an eager want in the manager,
by showing him the modern station, he had accomplished
his goal, and both the manager and Mike benefited.
Most people go through college and learn to read Virgil
and master the mysteries of calculus without ever
discovering how their own minds function. For instance:
I once gave a course in Effective Speaking for the young
college graduates who were entering the employ of the
Carrier Corporation, the large air-conditioner manufacturer.
One of the participants wanted to persuade the
others to play basketball in their free time, and this is
about what he said: &quot;I want you to come out and play
basketball. I like to play basketball, but the last few
times I’ve been to the gymnasium there haven’t been
enough people to get up a game. Two or three of us got
to throwing the ball around the other night - and I got a
black eye. I wish all of you would come down tomorrow
night. I want to play basketball.”
Did he talk about anything you want? You don’t want
to go to a gymnasium that no one else goes to, do you?
You don’t care about what he wants. You don’t want to
get a black eye.
Could he have shown you how to get the things you
want by using the gymnasium? Surely. More pep.
Keener edge to the appetite. Clearer brain. Fun. Games.
Basketball.
To repeat Professor Overstreet’s wise advice: First,
arouse in the other person an eager want He who can
do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot
walks a lonely way.
One of the students in the author’s training course was
worried about his little boy. The child was underweight
and refused to eat properly. His parents used the usual
method. They scolded and nagged. “Mother wants you
to eat this and that.” &quot;Father wants you to grow up to be
a big man.”
Did the boy pay any attention to these pleas? Just
about as much as you pay to one fleck of sand on a sandy
beach.
No one with a trace of horse sense would expect a
child three years old to react to the viewpoint of a father
thirty years old. Yet that was precisely what that father
had expected. It was absurd. He finally saw that. So he
said to himself: “What does that boy want? How can I
tie up what I want to what he wants?”
It was easy for the father when he starting thinking
about it. His boy had a tricycle that he loved to ride up
and down the sidewalk in front of the house in Brooklyn.
A few doors down the street lived a bully - a bigger boy
who would pull the little boy off his tricycle and ride it
himself.
Naturally, the little boy would run screaming to his
mother, and she would have to come out and take the
bully off the tricycle and put her little boy on again, This
happened almost every day.
What did the little boy want? It didn’t take a Sherlock
Holmes to answer that one. His pride, his anger, his
desire for a feeling of importance - all the strongest
emotions in his makeup - goaded him to get revenge, to
smash the bully in the nose. And when his father explained
that the boy would be able to wallop the daylights
out of the bigger kid someday if he would only eat
the things his mother wanted him to eat - when his father
promised him that - there was no longer any problem
of dietetics. That boy would have eaten spinach,
sauerkraut, salt mackerel - anything in order to be big
enough to whip the bully who had humiliated him so
often.
After solving that problem, the parents tackled another:
the little boy had the unholy habit of wetting his bed.
He slept with his grandmother. In the morning, his
grandmother would wake up and feel the sheet and say:
“Look, Johnny, what you did again last night.”
He would say: “No, I didn’t do it. You did it.”
Scolding, spanking, shaming him, reiterating that the
parents didn’t want him to do it - none of these things
kept the bed dry. So the parents asked: “How can we
make this boy want to stop wetting his bed?”
What were his wants? First, he wanted to wear pajamas
like Daddy instead of wearing a nightgown like
Grandmother. Grandmother was getting fed up with his
nocturnal iniquities, so she gladly offered to buy him a
pair of pajamas if he would reform. Second, he wanted a
bed of his own. Grandma didn’t object.
His mother took him to a department store in Brooklyn,
winked at the salesgirl, and said: “Here is a little
gentleman who would like to do some shopping.”
The salesgirl made him feel important by saying:
“Young man, what can I show you?”
He stood a couple of inches taller and said: “I want to
buy a bed for myself.”
When he was shown the one his mother wanted him
to buy, she winked at the salesgirl and the boy was persuaded
to buy it.
The bed was delivered the next day; and that night,
when Father came home, the little boy ran to the door
shouting: “Daddy! Daddy! Come upstairs and see my
bed that I bought!”
The father, looking at the bed, obeyed Charles
Schwab’s injunction: he was “hearty in his approbation
and lavish in his praise.”
“You are not going to wet this bed, are you?” the father
said. &quot; Oh, no, no! I am not going to wet this bed.” The boy
kept his promise, for his pride was involved. That was
his bed. He and he alone had bought it. And he was
wearing pajamas now like a little man. He wanted to act
like a man. And he did.
Another father, K. T. Dutschmann, a telephone engineer,
a student of this course, couldn’t get his three-year
old daughter to eat breakfast food. The usual scolding,
pleading, coaxing methods had all ended in futility. So
the parents asked themselves: “How can we make her
want to do it?”
The little girl loved to imitate her mother, to feel big
and grown up; so one morning they put her on a chair
and let her make the breakfast food. At just the psychological
moment, Father drifted into the kitchen while
she was stirring the cereal and she said: “Oh, look,
Daddy, I am making the cereal this morning.”
She ate two helpings of the cereal without any coaxing,
because she was interested in it. She had achieved
a feeling of importance; she had found in making the
cereal an avenue of self-expression.
William Winter once remarked that &quot;self-expression is
the dominant necessity of human nature.” Why can’t we
adapt this same psychology to business dealings? When
we have a brilliant idea, instead of making others think
it is ours, why not let them cook and stir the idea themselves.
They will then regard it as their own; they will
like it and maybe eat a couple of helpings of it.

When I was five years old, my father bought a little
yellow-haired pup for fifty cents. He was the light and
joy of my childhood. Every afternoon about four-thirty,
he would sit in the front yard with his beautiful eyes
staring steadfastly at the path, and as soon as he heard
my voice or saw me swinging my dinner pail through
the buck brush, he was off like a shot, racing breathlessly
up the hill to greet me with leaps of joy and barks of
sheer ecstasy.
Tippy was my constant companion for five years. Then
one tragic night - I shall never forget it - he was killed
within ten feet of my head, killed by lightning. Tippy’s
death was the tragedy of my boyhood.
You never read a book on psychology, Tippy. You
didn’t need to. You knew by some divine instinct that
you can make more friends in two months by becoming
genuinely interested in other people than you can in two
years by trying to get other people interested in you. Let
me repeat that. You can make more friends in two
months by becoming interested in other people than you
can in two years by trying to get other people interested
in you.
Yet I know and you know people who blunder through
life trying to wigwag other people into becoming interested
in them.
Of course, it doesn’t work. People are not interested
in you. They are not interested in me. They are interested
in themselves - morning, noon and after dinner.
The New York Telephone Company made a detailed
study of telephone conversations to find out which word
is the most frequently used. You have guessed it: it is
the personal pronoun “I.” “I.” I.” It was used 3,900
times in 500 telephone conversations. &quot;I.” “I.” “I.” &quot;I.”
When you see a group photograph that you are in,
whose picture do you look for first?
If we merely try to impress people and get people
interested in us, we will never have many true, sincere
friends. Friends, real friends, are not made that way.
Napoleon tried it, and in his last meeting with Josephine
he said: “Josephine, I have been as fortunate as
any man ever was on this earth; and yet, at this hour, you
are the only person in the world on whom I can rely.”
And historians doubt whether he could rely even on
her.
Alfred Adler, the famous Viennese psychologist, wrote
a book entitled What Life Should Mean to You. In that
book he says: “It is the individual who is not interested
in his fellow men who has the greatest difficulties in life
and provides the greatest injury to others. It is from
among such individuals that all human failures spring.”
You may read scores of erudite tomes on psychology
without coming across a statement more significant for
you and for me. Adler’s statement is so rich with meaning
that I am going to repeat it in italics:
It is the individual who is not interested in his fellow
men who has the greatest difjculties in life and provides
the greutest injury to others. It is from umong such individuals
that all humun failures spring.
I once took a course in short-story writing at New York
University, and during that course the editor of a leading
magazine talked to our class. He said he could pick up
any one of the dozens of stories that drifted across his
desk every day and after reading a few paragraphs he
could feel whether or not the author liked people. “If
the author doesn’t like people,” he said, “people won’t
like his or her stories.”
This hard-boiled editor stopped twice in the course of
his talk on fiction writing and apologized for preaching
a sermon. “I am telling you,” he said, “the same things
your preacher would tell you, but remember, you have
to be interested in people if you want to be a successful
writer of stories.”
If that is true of writing fiction, you can be sure it is
true of dealing with people face-to-face.
I spent an evening in the dressing room of Howard
Thurston the last time he appeared on Broadway -
Thurston was the acknowledged dean of magicians. For forty
years he had traveled all over the world, time and again,
creating illusions, mystifying audiences, and making
people gasp with astonishment. More than 60 million
people had paid admission to his show, and he had made
almost $2 million in profit.
I asked Mr. Thurston to tell me the secret of his success.
His schooling certainly had nothing to do with it,
for he ran away from home as a small boy, became a
hobo, rode in boxcars, slept in haystacks, begged his
food from door to door, and learned to read by looking
out of boxcars at signs along the railway.
Did he have a superior knowledge of magic? No, he
told me hundreds of books had been written about legerdemain
and scores of people knew as much about it as
he did. But he had two things that the others didn’t have.
First, he had the ability to put his personality across the
footlights. He was a master showman. He knew human
nature. Everything he did, every gesture, every intonation
of his voice, every lifting of an eyebrow had been
carefully rehearsed in advance, and his actions were
timed to split seconds. But, in addition to that, Thurston
had a genuine interest in people. He told me that many
magicians would look at the audience and say to themselves,
“Well, there is a bunch of suckers out there, a
bunch of hicks; I’ll fool them all right.” But Thurston’s
method was totally different. He told me that every time
he went on stage he said to himself: “I am grateful because
these people come to see me, They make it possible
for me to make my living in a very agreeable way.
I’m going to give them the very best I possibly can.”
He declared he never stepped in front of the footlights
without first saying to himself over and over: “I love my
audience. I love my audience.” Ridiculous? Absurd?
You are privileged to think anything you like. I am
merely passing it on to you without comment as a recipe
used by one of the most famous magicians of all time.
George Dyke of North Warren, Pennsylvania, was
forced to retire from his service station business after
thirty years when a new highway was constructed over
the site of his station. It wasn’t long before the idle days
of retirement began to bore him, so he started filling in
his time trying to play music on his old fiddle. Soon he
was traveling the area to listen to music and talk with
many of the accomplished fiddlers. In his humble and
friendly way he became generally interested in learning
the background and interests of every musician he met.
Although he was not a great fiddler himself, he made
many friends in this pursuit. He attended competitions
and soon became known to the country music fans in the
eastern part of the United States as “Uncle George, the
Fiddle Scraper from Kinzua County.” When we heard
Uncle George, he was seventy-two and enjoying every
minute of his life. By having a sustained interest in other
people, he created a new life for himself at a time when
most people consider their productive years over.
That, too, was one of the secrets of Theodore Roosevelt’s
astonishing popularity. Even his servants loved
him. His valet, James E. Amos, wrote a book about him
entitled Theodore Roosevelt, Hero to His Valet. In that
book Amos relates this illuminating incident:
My wife one time asked the President about a bobwhite.
She had never seen one and he described it to her fully.
Sometime later, the telephone at our cottage rang. <!-- -->[Amos
and his wife lived in a little cottage on the Roosevelt estate
at Oyster Bay.]<!-- --> My wife answered it and it was Mr. Roosevelt
himself. He had called her, he said, to tell her that there
was a bobwhite outside her window and that if she would
look out she might see it. Little things like that were so
characteristic of him. Whenever he went by our cottage,
even though we were out of sight, we would hear him call
out: “Oo-oo-oo, Annie?” or “Oo-oo-oo, James!” It was just a
friendly greeting as he went by.
How could employees keep from liking a man like
that? How could anyone keep from liking him?
Roosevelt called at the White House one day when
the President and Mrs. Taft were away. His honest liking
for humble people was shown by the fact that he
greeted all the old White House servants by name, even
the scullery maids.
“When he saw Alice, the kitchen maid,” writes Archie
Butt, “he asked her if she still made corn bread. Alice
told him that she sometimes made it for the servants, but
no one ate it upstairs.
&quot;‘They show bad taste,’ Roosevelt boomed, ‘and I’ll
tell the President so when I see him.’
“Alice brought a piece to him on a plate, and he went
over to the office eating it as he went and greeting gardeners
and laborers as he passed. . .
“He addressed each person just as he had addressed
them in the past. Ike Hoover, who had been head usher
at the White House for forty years, said with tears in his
eyes: ‘It is the only happy day we had in nearly two
years, and not one of us would exchange it for a hundred-dollar
bill.’ ”
The same concern for the seemingly unimportant people
helped sales representative Edward M. Sykes, Jr., of
Chatham, New Jersey, retain an account. “Many years
ago,” he reported, “I called on customers for Johnson
and Johnson in the Massachusetts area. One account was
a drug store in Hingham. Whenever I went into this
store I would always talk to the soda clerk and sales
clerk for a few minutes before talking to the owner to
obtain his order. One day I went up to the owner of the
store, and he told me to leave as he was not interested in
buying J&amp;J products anymore because he felt they were
concentrating their activities on food and discount stores
to the detriment of the small drugstore. I left with my
tail between my legs and drove around the town for several
hours. Finally, I decided to go back and try at least
to explain our position to the owner of the store.
“When I returned I walked in and as usual said hello
to the soda clerk and sales clerk. When I walked up to
the owner, he smiled at me and welcomed me back. He
then gave me double the usual order, I looked at him
with surprise and asked him what had happened since
my visit only a few hours earlier. He pointed to the
young man at the soda fountain and said that after I had
left, the boy had come over and said that I was one of the
few salespeople that called on the store that even bothered
to say hello to him and to the others in the store. He
told the owner that if any salesperson deserved his business,
it was I. The owner agreed and remained a loyal
customer. I never forgot that to be genuinely interested
in other people is a most important quality for a sales-person
to possess - for any person, for that matter.”
I have discovered from personal experience that one
can win the attention and time and cooperation of even
the most sought-after people by becoming genuinely interested
in them. Let me illustrate.
Years ago I conducted a course in fiction writing at the
Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, and we wanted
such distinguished and busy authors as Kathleen Norris,
Fannie Hurst, Ida Tarbell, Albert Payson Terhune and
Rupert Hughes to come to Brooklyn and give us the
benefit of their experiences. So we wrote them, saying
we admired their work and were deeply interested in
getting their advice and learning the secrets of their success.
Each of these letters was signed by about a hundred
and fifty students. We said we realized that these authors
were busy - too busy to prepare a lecture. So we enclosed
a list of questions for them to answer about themselves
and their methods of work. They liked that. Who
wouldn’t like it? So they left their homes and traveled to
Brooklyn to give us a helping hand.
By using the same method, I persuaded Leslie M.
Shaw, secretary of the treasury in Theodore Roosevelt’s
cabinet; George W. Wickersham, attorney general in
Taft’s cabinet; William Jennings Bryan; Franklin D.
Roosevelt and many other prominent men to come to
talk to the students of my courses in public speaking.
All of us, be we workers in a factory, clerks in an office
or even a king upon his throne - all of us like people
who admire us. Take the German Kaiser, for example. At
the close of World War I he was probably the most savagely
and universally despised man on this earth. Even
his own nation turned against him when he fled over
into Holland to save his neck. The hatred against him
was so intense that millions of people would have loved
to tear him limb from limb or burn him at the stake. In
the midst of all this forest fire of fury, one little boy wrote
the Kaiser a simple, sincere letter glowing with kindliness
and admiration. This little boy said that no matter
what the others thought, he would always love Wilhelm
as his Emperor. The Kaiser was deeply touched by his
letter and invited the little boy to come to see him. The
boy came, so did his mother - and the Kaiser married
her. That little boy didn’t need to read a book on how to
win friends and influence people. He knew how instinctively.
If we want to make friends, let’s put ourselves out to
do things for other people - things that require time, energy,
unselfishness and thoughtfulness. When the Duke
of Windsor was Prince of Wales, he was scheduled to
tour South America, and before he started out on that
tour he spent months studying Spanish so that he could
make public talks in the language of the country; and
the South Americans loved him for it.
For years I made it a point to find out the birthdays of
my friends. How? Although I haven’t the foggiest bit of
faith in astrology, I began by asking the other party
whether he believed the date of one’s birth has anything
to do with character and disposition. I then asked him or
her to tell me the month and day of birth. If he or she
said November 24, for example, I kept repeating to myself,
“November 24, November 24.” The minute my
friend’s back was turned, I wrote down the name and
birthday and later would transfer it to a birthday book.
At the beginning of each year, I had these birthday dates
scheduled in my calendar pad so that they came to my
attention automatically. When the natal day arrived,
there was my letter or telegram. What a hit it made! I
was frequently the only person on earth who remembered.
If we want to make friends, let’s greet people with
animation and enthusiasm. When somebody calls you on
the telephone use the same psychology. Say “Hello” in
tones that bespeak how pleased YOU are to have the person
call. Many companies train their telephone operatars
to greet all callers in a tone of voice that radiates
interest and enthusiasm. The caller feels the company is
concerned about them. Let’s remember that when we
answer the telephone tomorrow.
Showing a genuine interest in others not only wins
friends for you, but may develop in its customers a loyalty
to your company. In an issue of the publication of
the National Bank of North America of New York, the
following letter from Madeline Rosedale, a depositor,
was published: *</li></ul><ul><li>Eagle, publication of the Natirmal Bank of North America, h-ew York,
March 31, 1978.
“I would like you to know how much I appreciate
your staff. Everyone is so courteous, polite and helpful.
What a pleasure it is, after waiting on a long line, to have
the teller greet you pleasantly.
“Last year my mother was hospitalized for five
months. Frequently I went to Marie Petrucello, a teller.
She was concerned about my mother and inquired about
her progress.”
Is there any doubt that Mrs. Rosedale will continue to
use this bank?
Charles R. Walters, of one of the large banks in New
York City, was assigned to prepare a confidential report
on a certain corporation. He knew of only one person
who possessed the facts he needed so urgently. As Mr.
Walters was ushered into the president’s office, a young
woman stuck her head through a door and told the president
that she didn’t have any stamps for him that day.
&quot;I am collecting stamps for my twelve-year-old son,”
the president explained to Mr. Walters.
Mr. Walters stated his mission and began asking questions.
The president was vague, general, nebulous. He
didn’t want to talk, and apparently nothing could persuade
him to talk. The interview was brief and barren.
“Frankly, I didn’t know what to do,” Mr. Walters said
as he related the story to the class. “Then I remembered
what his secretary had said to him - stamps, twelve-year-
old son. . . And I also recalled that the foreign department
of our bank collected stamps - stamps taken
from letters pouring in from every continent washed by
the seven seas.
“The next afternoon I called on this man and sent in
word that I had some stamps for his boy. Was I ushered
in with enthusiasm? Yes sir, He couldn’t have shaken
my hand with more enthusiasm if he had been running
for Congress. He radiated smiles and good will. ‘My
George will love this one,’ he kept saying as he fondled
the stamps. ‘And look at this! This is a treasure.’
“We spent half an hour talking stamps and looking at
a picture of his boy, and he then devoted more than an
hour of his time to giving me every bit of information I
wanted - without my even suggesting that he do it. He
told me all he knew, and then called in his subordinates
and questioned them. He telephoned some of his associates.
He loaded me down with facts, figures, reports
and correspondence. In the parlance of newspaper reporters,
I had a scoop.”
Here is another illustration:
C. M. Knaphle, Jr., of Philadelphia had tried for years
to sell fuel to a large chain-store organization. But the
chain-store company continued to purchase its fuel from
an out-of-town dealer and haul it right past the door of
Knaphle’s office. Mr, Knaphle made a speech one night
before one of my classes, pouring out his hot wrath
upon chain stores, branding them as a curse to the
nation.
And still he wondered why he couldn’t sell them.
I suggested that he try different tactics. To put it
briefly, this is what happened. We staged a debate between
members of the course on whether the spread of
the chain store is doing the country more harm than
good.
Knaphle, at my suggestion, took the negative side; he
agreed to defend the chain stores, and then went straight
to an executive of the chain-store organization that he
despised and said: “I am not here to try to sell fuel. I
have come to ask you to do me a favor.” He then told
about his debate and said, “I have come to you for help
because I can’t think of anyone else who would be more
capable of giving me the facts I want. I’m anxious to win
this debate, and I’ll deeply appreciate whatever help
you can give me.”
Here is the rest of the story in Mr. Knaphle’s own
words:
I had asked this man for precisely one minute of his time.
It was with that understanding that he consented to see me.
After I had stated my case, he motioned me to a chair and
talked to me for exactly one hour and forty-seven minutes.
He called in another executive who had written a book on
chain stores. He wrote to the National Chain Store Association
and secured for me a copy of a debate on the subject.
He feels that the chain store is rendering a real service to
humanity. He is proud of what he is doing for hundreds of
communities. His eyes fairly glowed as he talked, and I
must confess that he opened my eyes to things I had never
even dreamed of. He changed my whole mental attitude.
As I was leaving, he walked with me to the door, put his
arm around my shoulder, wished me well in my debate, and
asked me to stop in and see him again and let him know
how I made out. The last words he said to me were: “Please
see me again later in the spring. I should like to place an
order with you for fuel.”
To me that was almost a miracle. Here he was offering to
buy fuel without my even suggesting it. I had made more
headway in two hours by becoming genuinely interested in
him and his problems than I could have made in ten years
trying to get him interested in me and my product.
You didn’t discover a new truth, Mr. Knaphle, for a
long time ago, a hundred years before Christ was born
a famous old Roman poet, Publilius Syrus, remarked;
“We are interested in others when they are interested in us.&quot;
A show of interest, as with every other principle of
human relations, must be sincere. It must pay off not
only for the person showing the interest, but for the person
receiving the attention. It is a two-way street-both
parties benefit.
Martin Ginsberg, who took our Course in Long Island
New York, reported how the special interest a nurse took
in him profoundly affected his life:
“It was Thanksgiving Day and I was ten years old. I
was in a welfare ward of a city hospital and was scheduled
to undergo major orthopedic surgery the next day.
I knew that I could only look forward to months of confinement,
convalescence and pain. My father was dead;
my mother and I lived alone in a small apartment and
we were on welfare. My mother was unable to visit me
that day.
“As the day went on, I became overwhelmed with the
feeling of loneliness, despair and fear. I knew my
mother was home alone worrying about me, not having
anyone to be with, not having anyone to eat with and not
even having enough money to afford a Thanksgiving
Day dinner.
“The tears welled up in my eyes, and I stuck my head
under the pillow and pulled the covers over it, I cried
silently, but oh so bitterly, so much that my body racked
with pain.
“A young student nurse heard my sobbing and came
over to me. She took the covers off my face and started
wiping my tears. She told me how lonely she was, having
to work that day and not being able to be with her
family. She asked me whether I would have dinner with
her. She brought two trays of food: sliced turkey, mashed
a potatoes, cranberry sauce and ice cream for dessert. She
talked to me and tried to calm my fears. Even though
she was scheduled to go off duty at 4 P.M., she stayed on
her own time until almost 11 P.M. She played games
with me, talked to me and stayed with me until I finally
fell asleep.
“Many Thanksgivings have come and gone since I
was ten, but one never passes without me remembering
that particular one and my feelings of frustration, fear,
loneliness and the warmth and tenderness of the
stranger that somehow made it all bearable.”
If you want others to like you, if you want to develop
real friendships, if you want to help others at the
same time as you help yourself, keep this principle in
mind:
PRINCIPLE 1Become genuinely interested in other people.A SIMPLE WAY TO MAKE A GOODFIRST IMPRESSION
At a dinner party in New York, one of the guests, a
woman who had inherited money, was eager to make
a pleasing impression on everyone. She had squandered
a modest fortune on sables, diamonds and pearls. But
she hadn’t done anything whatever about her face. It
radiated sourness and selfishness. She didn’t realize
what everyone knows: namely, that the expression one
wears on one’s face is far more important than the
clothes one wears on one’s back.
Charles Schwab told me his smile had been worth a
million dollars. And he was probably understating the
truth. For Schwab’s personality, his charm, his ability to
make people like him, were almost wholly responsible
for his extraordinary success; and one of the most delightful
factors in his personality was his captivating
smile.
Actions speak louder than words, and a smile says, “I
like you, You make me happy. I am glad to see you.”
That is why dogs make such a hit. They are so glad to
see us that they almost jump out of their skins. So, naturally,
we are glad to see them.
A baby’s smile has the same effect.
Have you ever been in a doctor’s waiting room and
looked around at all the glum faces waiting impatiently
to be seen? Dr, Stephen K. Sproul, a veterinarian in Raytown,
Missouri, told of a typical spring day when his
waiting room was full of clients waiting to have their
pets inoculated. No one was talking to anyone else, and
all were probably thinking of a dozen other things they
would rather be doing than “wasting time” sitting in that
office. He told one of our classes: “There were six or
seven clients waiting when a young woman came in
with a nine-month-old baby and a kitten. As luck would
have it, she sat down next to a gentleman who was more
than a little distraught about the long wait for service.
The next thing he knew, the baby just looked up at him
with that great big smile that is so characteristic of babies.
What did that gentleman do? Just what you and I
would do, of course; he-smiled back at the baby. Soon
he struck up a conversation with the woman about her
baby and his grandchildren, and soon the entire reception
room joined in, and the boredom and tension were
converted into a pleasant and enjoyable experience.”
An insincere grin? No. That doesn’t fool anybody. We
know it is mechanical and we resent it. I am talking
about a real smile, a heartwarming smile, a smile that
comes from within, the kind of smile that will bring a
good price in the marketplace.
Professor James V. McConnell, a psychologist at the
University of Michigan, expressed his feelings about a
smile. “People who smile,” he said, “tend to manage
teach and sell more effectively, and to raise happier
children. There’s far more information in a smile than a
frown. That’s why encouragement is a much more effective
teaching device than punishment.”
The employment manager of a large New York department
store told me she would rather hire a sales clerk
who hadn’t finished grade school, if he or she has a
pleasant smile, than to hire a doctor of philosophy with
a somber face.
The effect of a smile is powerful - even when it is
unseen. Telephone companies throughout the United
States have a program called “phone power” which is
offered to employees who use the telephone for selling
their services or products. In this program they suggest
that you smile when talking on the phone. Your “smile”
comes through in your voice.
Robert Cryer, manager of a computer department for a
Cincinnati, Ohio, company, told how he had successfully
found the right applicant for a hard-to-fill position:
“I was desperately trying to recruit a Ph.D. in computer
science for my department. I finally located a
young man with ideal qualifications who was about to
be graduated from Purdue University. After several
phone conversations I learned that he had several offers
from other companies, many of them larger and better
known than mine. I was delighted when he accepted my
offer. After he started on the job, I asked him why he
had chosen us over the others. He paused for a moment
and then he said: ‘I think it was because managers in the
other companies spoke on the phone in a cold, business-like
manner, which made me feel like just another business
transaction, Your voice sounded as if you were glad
to hear from me . . . that you really wanted me to be part
of your organization. ’ You can be assured, I am still answering
my phone with a smile.”
The chairman of the board of directors of one of the
largest rubber companies ‘in the United States told me
that, according to his observations, people rarely succeed
at anything unless they have fun doing it. This
industrial leader doesn’t put much faith in the old adage
that hard work alone is the magic key that will unlock
the door to our desires, “I have known people,” he said,
“who succeeded because they had a rip-roaring good
time conducting their business. Later, I saw those people
change as the fun became work. The business had
grown dull, They lost all joy in it, and they failed.”
You must have a good time meeting people if you expect
them to have a good time meeting you.
I have asked thousands of business people to smile at
someone every hour of the day for a week and then come
to class and talk about the results. How did it work?
Let’s see. . . Here is a letter from William B. Steinhardt,
a New York stockbroker. His case isn’t isolated. In fact,
it is typical of hundreds of cases.
“1 have been married for over eighteen years,” wrote
Mr. Steinhardt, “and in all that time I seldom smiled at
my wife or spoke two dozen words to her from the time
I got up until I was ready to leave for business. I was
one of the worst grouches who ever walked down Broadway.
“When you asked me to make a talk about my experience
with smiles, I thought I would try it for a week. So
the next morning, while combing my hair, I looked at
my glum mug in the mirror and said to myself, ‘Bill, you
are going to wipe the scowl off that sour puss of yours
today. You are going to smile. And you are going to begin
right now.’ As I sat down to breakfast, I greeted my wife
with a ‘Good morning, my dear,’ and smiled as I said
it.
“You warned me that she might be surprised. Well,
you underestimated her reaction. She was bewildered.
She was shocked. I told her that in the future she could
expect this as a regular occurrence, and I kept it up every
morning.
“This changed attitude of mine brought more happiness
into our home in the two months since I started
than there was during the last year.
“As I leave for my office, I greet the elevator operator
in the apartment house with a ‘Good morning’ and a
smile, I greet the doorman with a smile. I smile at the
cashier in the subway booth when I ask for change. As I
stand on the floor of the Stock Exchange, I smile at people
who until recently never saw me smile.
“I soon found that everybody was smiling back at me,
I treat those who come to me with complaints or grievances
in a cheerful manner, I smile as I listen to them
and I find that adjustments are accomplished much easier.
I find that smiles are bringing me dollars, many dollars
every day.
“I share my office with another broker. One of his
clerks is a likable young chap, and I was so elated about
the results I was getting that I told him recently about
my new philosophy of human relations. He then confessed
that when I first came to share my office with his
firm he thought me a terrible grouch - and only recently
changed his mind. He said I was really human when I
smiled.
“I have also eliminated criticism from my system. I
give appreciation and praise now instead of condemnation.
I have stopped talking about what I want. I am now
trying to see the other person’s viewpoint. And these
things have literally revolutionized my life. I am a totally
different man, a happier man, a richer man, richer in
friendships and happiness - the only things that matter
much after all.”
You don’t feel like smiling? Then what? Two things.
First, force yourself to smile. If you are alone, force yourself
to whistle or hum a tune or sing. Act as if you were
already happy, and that will tend to make you happy.
Here is the way the psychologist and philosopher William
James put it:
“Action seems to follow feeling, but really action and
feeling go together; and by regulating the action, which
is under the more direct control of the will, we can indirectly
regulate the feeling, which is not.
“Thus the sovereign voluntary path to cheerfulness, if
our cheerfulness be lost, is to sit up cheerfully and to act
and speak as if cheerfulness were already there. . . .”
Every body in the world is seeking happiness - and
there is one sure way to find it. That is by controlling
your thoughts. Happiness doesn’t depend on outward
conditions. It depends on inner conditions.
It isn’t what you have or who you are or where you are
or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy.
It is what you think about it. For example, two people
may be in the same place, doing the same thing; both
may have about an equal amount of money and prestige</li></ul><ul><li>and yet one may be miserable and the other happy.
Why? Because of a different mental attitude. I have seen
just as many happy faces among the poor peasants toiling
with their primitive tools in the devastating heat of the
tropics as I have seen in air-conditioned offices in New
York, Chicago or Los Angeles.
“There is nothing either good or bad,” said Shakespeare,
“but thinking makes it so.”
Abe Lincoln once remarked that “most folks are about
as happy as they make up their minds to be.” He was
right. I saw a vivid illustration of that truth as I was
walking up the stairs of the Long Island Railroad station
in New York. Directly in front of me thirty or forty crippled
boys on canes and crutches were struggling up the
stairs. One boy had to be carried up. I was astonished at
their laughter and gaiety. I spoke about it to one of.the
men in charge of the boys. “Oh, yes,” he said, “when a
boy realizes that he is going to be a cripple for life, he is
shocked at first; but after he gets over the shock, he usually
resigns himself to his fate and then becomes as
happy as normal boys.”
I felt like taking my hat off to those boys. They taught
me a lesson I hope I shall never forget.
Working all by oneself in a closed-off room in an office
not only is lonely, but it denies one the opportunity of
making friends with other employees in the company.
Señora Maria Gonzalez of Guadalajara, Mexico, had
such a job. She envied the shared comradeship of other
people in the company as she heard their chatter and
laughter. As she passed them in the hall during the first
weeks of her employment, she shyly looked the other
way.
After a few weeks, she said to herself, “Maria, you
can’t expect those women to come to you. You have to
go out and meet them. ” The next time she walked to the
water cooler, she put on her brightest smile and said,
“Hi, how are you today” to each of the people she met.
The effect was immediate. Smiles and hellos were returned,
the hallway seemed brighter, the job friendlier.
Acquaintanceships developed and some ripened into
friendships. Her job and her life became more pleasant
and interesting.
Peruse this bit of sage advice from the essayist and
publisher Elbert Hubbard - but remember, perusing it
won’t do you any good unless you apply it:
Whenever you go out-of-doors, draw the chin in, carry the
crown of the head high, and fill the lungs to the utmost;
drink in the sunshine; greet your friends with a smile, and
put soul into every handclasp. Do not fear being misunderstood
and do not waste a minute thinking about your enemies.
Try to fix firmly in your mind what you would like to
do; and then, without veering off direction, you will move
straight to the goal. Keep your mind on the great and splendid
things you would like to do, and then, as the days go
gliding away, you will find yourself unconsciously seizing
upon the opportunities that are required for the fulfillment
of your desire, just as the coral insect takes from the running
tide the element it needs. Picture in your mind the able,
earnest, useful person you desire to be, and the thought you
hold is hourly transforming you into that particular individual.
. . . Thought is supreme. Preserve a right mental attitude -
the attitude of courage, frankness, and good cheer.
To think rightly is to create. All things come through desire
and every sincere prayer is answered. We become like that
on which our hearts are fixed. Carry your chin in and the
crown of your head high. We are gods in the chrysalis.
The ancient Chinese were a wise lot - wise in the
ways of the world; and they had a proverb that you and
I ought to cut out and paste inside our hats. It goes like
this: “A man without a smiling face must not open a
shop.”
Your smile is a messenger of your good will. Your
smile brightens the lives of all who see it. To someone
who has seen a dozen people frown, scowl or turn their
faces away, your smile is like the sun breaking through
the clouds. Especially when that someone is under pressure
from his bosses, his customers, his teachers or parents
or children, a smile can help him realize that all is
not hopeless - that there is joy in the world.
Some years ago, a department store in New York City,
in recognition of the pressures its sales clerks were
under during the Christmas rush, presented the readers
of its advertisements with the following homely philosophy:
THE VALUE OF A SMILE AT CHRISTMAS
It costs nothing, but creates much.
It enriches those who receive, without impoverishing those
who give.
It happens in a flash and the memory of it sometimes lasts
forever,
None are so rich they can get along without it, and none so
poor but are richer for its benefits.
It creates happiness in the home, fosters good will in a
business, and is the countersign of friends.
It is rest to the weary, daylight to the discouraged, sunshine
to the sad, and Nature’s best antidote fee trouble.
Yet it cannot be bought, begged, borrowed, or stolen, for it
is something that is no earthly good to anybody till it is
given away.
And if in the last-minute rush of Christmas buying some of
our salespeople should be too tired to give you a smile,
may we ask you to leave one of yours?
For nobody needs a smile so much as those who have none
left to give!
PRINCIPLE 2Smile.IF YOU DON’T DO THIS, YOU AREHEADED FOR TROUBLE
Back in 1898, a tragic thing happened in Rockland
County, New York. A child had died, and on this particular
day the neighbors were preparing to go to the funeral.
Jim Farley went out to the barn to hitch up his
horse. The ground was covered with snow, the air was
cold and snappy; the horse hadn’t been exercised for
days; and as he was led out to the watering trough, he
wheeled playfully, kicked both his heels high in the air,
and killed Jim Farley. So the little village of Stony Point
had two funerals that week instead of one.
Jim Farley left behind him a widow and three boys,
and a few hundred dollars in insurance.
His oldest boy, Jim, was ten, and he went to work in a
brickyard, wheeling sand and pouring it into the molds
and turning the brick on edge to be dried by the sun.
This boy Jim never had a chance to get much education.
But with his natural geniality, he had a flair for making
people like him, so he went into politics, and as the
years went by, he developed an uncanny ability for remembering
people’s names.
He never saw the inside of a high school; but before
he was forty-six years of age, four colleges had honored
him with degrees and he had become chairman of the
Democratic National Committee and Postmaster General
of the United States.
I once interviewed Jim Farley and asked him the secret
of his success. He said, “Hard work,” and I said,
“Don’t be funny.”
He then asked me what I thought was the reason for
his success. I replied: &quot;I understand you can call ten
thousand people by their first names.”
“No. You are wrong, &quot; he said. “I can call fifty thousand
people by their first names.”
Make no mistake about it. That ability helped Mr. Farley
put Franklin D. Roosevelt in the White House when
he managed Roosevelt’s campaign in 1932.
During the years that Jim Farley traveled as a salesman
for a gypsum concern, and during the years that he
held office as town clerk in Stony Point, he built up a
system for remembering names.
In the beginning, it was a very simple one. Whenever
he met a new acquaintance, he found out his or her complete
name and some facts about his or her family, business
and political opinions. He fixed all these facts well
in mind as part of the picture, and the next time he met
that person, even if it was a year later, he was able to
shake hands, inquire after the family, and ask about the
hollyhocks in the backyard. No wonder he developed a
following!
For months before Roosevelt’s campaign for President
began, Jim Farley wrote hundreds of letters a day to
people all over the western and northwestern states.
Then he hopped onto a train and in nineteen days covered
twenty states and twelve thousand miles, traveling
by buggy, train, automobile and boat. He would drop
into town, meet his people at lunch or breakfast, tea or
dinner, and give them a “heart-to-heart talk.” Then he’d
dash off again on another leg of his journey.
As soon as he arrived back East, he wrote to one person
in each town he had visited, asking for a list of all
the guests to whom he had talked. The final list contained
thousands and thousands of names; yet each person
on that list was paid the subtle flattery of getting a
personal letter from James Farley. These letters began
“Dear Bill” or “Dear Jane,” and they were always
signed &quot;Jim.&quot;
Jim Farley discovered early in life that the average
person is more interested in his or her own name than
in all the other names on earth put together. Remember
that name and call it easily, and you have paid a subtle
and very effective compliment. But forget it or misspell
it - and you have placed yourself at a sharp disadvantage.
For example, I once organized a public-speaking
course in Paris and sent form letters to all the American
residents in the city. French typists with apparently little
knowledge of English filled in the names and naturally
they made blunders. One man, the manager of a
large American bank in Paris, wrote me a scathing rebuke
because his name had been misspelled.
Sometimes it is difficult to remember a name, particularly
if it is hard to pronounce. Rather than even try to
learn it, many people ignore it or call the person by an
easy nickname. Sid Levy called on a customer for some
time whose name was Nicodemus Papadoulos. Most
people just called him “Nick.” Levy told us: “I made a
special effort to say his name over several times to myself
before I made my call. When I greeted him by his
full name: &#x27;Good afternoon, Mr. Nicodemus Papadoulos,’
he was shocked. For what seemed like several minutes
there was no reply from him at all. Finally, he said
with tears rolling down his cheeks, ‘Mr. Levy, in all the
fifteen years I have been in this country, nobody has
ever made the effort to call me by my right name.’ &quot;
What was the reason for Andrew Carnegie’s success?
He was called the Steel King; yet he himself knew
little about the manufacture of steel. He had hundreds
of people working for him who knew far more about
steel than he did.
But he knew how to handle people, and that is what
made him rich. Early in life, he showed a flair for organization,
a genius for leadership. By the time he was ten,
he too had discovered the astounding importance people
place on their own name. And he used that discovery to
win cooperation. To illustrate: When he was a boy back
in Scotland, he got hold of a rabbit, a mother rabbit.
Presto! He soon had a whole nest of little rabbits - and
nothing to feed them. But he had a brilliant idea. He told
the boys and girls in the neighborhood that if they would
go out and pull enough clover and dandelions to feed
the rabbits, he would name the bunnies in their honor.
The plan worked like magic, and Carnegie never forgot
it.
Years later, he made millions by using the same psychology
in business. For example, he wanted to sell
steel rails to the Pennsylvania Railroad. J. Edgar Thomson
was the president of the Pennsylvania Railroad then.
So Andrew Carnegie built a huge steel mill in Pittsburgh
and called it the “Edgar Thomson Steel Works.”
Here is a riddle. See if you can guess it. When the
Pennsylvania Railroad needed steel rails, where do you
suppose J. Edgar Thomson bought them?. . , From
Sears, Roebuck? No. No. You’re wrong. Guess again.
When Carnegie and George Pullman were battling
each other for supremacy in the railroad sleeping-car
business, the Steel King again remembered the lesson
of the rabbits.
The Central Transportation Company, which Andrew
Carnegie controlled, was fighting with the company that
Pullman owned. Both were struggling to get the sleeping-
car business of the Union Pacific Railroad, bucking
each other, slashing prices, and destroving all chance of
profit. Both Carnegie and Pullman had gone to New
York to see the board of directors of the Union Pacific.
Meeting one evening in the St. Nicholas Hotel, Carnegie
said: “Good evening, Mr. Pullman, aren’t we making
a couple of fools of ourselves?”
“What do you mean.?&quot; Pullman demanded.
Then Carnegie expressed what he had on his mind - a
merger of their two interests. He pictured in glowing
terms the mutual advantages of working with, instead of
against, each other. Pullman listened attentively, but he
was not wholly convinced. Finally he asked, “What
would you call the new company?” and Carnegie replied
promptly: “Why, the Pullman Palace Car Company,
of course.”
Pullman’s face brightened. “Come into my room,” he
said. “Let’s talk it over.” That talk made industrial history.
This policy of remembering and honoring the names
of his friends and business associates was one of the
secrets of Andrew Carnegie’s leadership. He was proud
of the fact that he could call many of his factory workers
by their first names, and he boasted that while he was
personally in charge, no strike ever disturbed his flaming
steel mills.
Benton Love, chairman of Texas Commerce Banc-
shares, believes that the bigger a corporation gets, the
colder it becomes. &quot; One way to warm it up,” he said, “is
to remember people’s names. The executive who tells
me he can’t remember names is at the same time telling
me he can’t remember a significant part of his business
and is operating on quicksand.”
Karen Kirsech of Rancho Palos Verdes, California, a
flight attendant for TWA, made it a practice to learn the
names of as many passengers in her cabin as possible
and use the name when serving them. This resulted in
many compliments on her service expressed both to her
directly and to the airline. One passenger wrote: &quot;I
haven’t flown TWA for some time, but I’m going to start
flying nothing but TWA from now on. You make me feel
that your airline has become a very personalized airline
and that is important to me.”
People are so proud of their names that they strive to
perpetuate them at any cost. Even blustering, hard-boiled
old P. T. Barnum, the greatest showman of his
time, disappointed because he had no sons to carry on
his name, offered his grandson, C. H. Seeley, $25,000
dollars if he would call himself “Barnum” Seeley.
For many centuries, nobles and magnates supported
artists, musicians and authors so that their creative works
would be dedicated to them.
Libraries and museums owe their richest collections
to people who cannot bear to think that their names
might perish from the memory of the race. The New
York Public Library has its Astor and Lenox collections.
The Metropolitan Museum perpetuates the names of
Benjamin Altman and J. P. Morgan. And nearly every
church is beautified by stained-glass windows commemorating
the names of their donors. Many of the buildings
on the campus of most universities bear the names of
donors who contributed large sums of money for this
honor.
Most people don’t remember names, for the simple
reason that they don’t take the time and energy necessary
to concentrate and repeat and fix names indelibly in
their minds. They make excuses for themselves; they are
too busy.
But they were probably no busier than Franklin D.
Roosevelt, and he took time to remember and recall
even the names of mechanics with whom he came into
contact.
To illustrate: The Chrysler organization built a special
car for Mr. Roosevelt, who could not use a standard car
because his legs were paralyzed. W. F. Chamberlain and
a mechanic delivered it to the White House. I have in
front of me a letter from Mr. Chamberlain relating his
experiences. &quot;I taught President Roosevelt how to handle
a car with a lot of unusual gadgets, but he taught me
a lot about the fine art of handling people.
&quot;When I called at the White House,” Mr. Chamberlain
writes, “the President was extremely pleasant and
cheerful. He called me by name, made me feel very
comfortable, and particularly impressed me with the fact
that he was vitally interested in things I had to show him
and tell him. The car was so designed that it could be
operated entirely by hand. A crowd gathered around to
look at the car; and he remarked: ‘I think it is marvelous.
All you have to do is to touch a button and it moves away
and you can drive it without effort. I think it is grand - I
don’t know what makes it go. I’d love to have the time to
tear it down and see how it works.’
“When Roosevelt’s friends and associates admired the
machine, he said in their presence: ‘Mr. Chamberlain, I
certainly appreciate all the time and effort you have
spent in developing this car. It is a mighty fine job.’ He
admired the radiator, the special rear-vision mirror and
clock, the special spotlight, the kind of upholstery, the
sitting position of the driver’s seat, the special suitcases
in the trunk with his monogram on each suitcase. In
other words, he took notice of every detail to which he
knew I had given considerable thought. He made a point
of bringing these various pieces of equipment to the attention
of Mrs. Roosevelt, Miss Perkins, the Secretary of
Labor, and his secretary. He even brought the old White
House porter into the picture by saying, ‘George, you
want to take particularly good care of the suitcases.’
“When the driving lesson was finished, the President
turned to me and said: ‘Well, Mr. Chamberlain, I have
been keeping the Federal Reserve Board waiting thirty
minutes. I guess I had better get back to work.’
&quot;I took a mechanic with me to the White House. He
was introduced to Roosevelt when he arrived. He didn’t
talk to the President, and Roosevelt heard his name only
once. He was a shy chap, and he kept in the background.
But before leaving us, the President looked for the mechanic,
shook his hand, called him by name, and
thanked him for coming to Washington. And there was
nothing perfunctory about his thanks. He meant what he
said. I could feel that.
“A few days after returning to New York, I got an autographed
photograph of President Roosevelt and a little
note of thanks again expressing his appreciation for my
assistance. How he found time to do it is a mystery to
me .&quot;
Franklin D. Roosevelt knew that one of the simplest,
most obvious and most important ways of gaining good
will was by remembering names and making people feel
important - yet how many of us do it?
Half the time we are introduced to a stranger, we chat
a few minutes and can’t even remember his or her name
by the time we say goodbye.
One of the first lessons a politician learns is this: “To
recall a voter’s name is statesmanship. To forget it is
oblivion.”
And the ability to remember names is almost as important
in business and social contacts as it is in politics.
Napoleon the Third, Emperor of France and nephew
of the great Napoleon, boasted that in spite of all his
royal duties he could remember the name of every person
he met.
His technique? Simple. If he didn’t hear the name
distinctly, he said, “So sorry. I didn’t get the name
clearly.” Then, if it was an unusual name, he would say,
“How is it spelled?”
During the conversation, he took the trouble to repeat
the name several times, and tried to associate it in his
mind with the person’s features, expression and general
appearance.
If the person was someone of importance, Napoleon
went to even further pains. As soon as His Royal Highness
was alone, he wrote the name down on a piece of
paper, looked at it, concentrated on it, fixed it securely
in his mind, and then tore up the paper. In this way, he
gained an eye impression of the name as well as an ear
impression.
All this takes time, but “Good manners,” said Emerson,
&quot;are made up of petty sacrifices.”
The importance of remembering and using names is
not just the prerogative of kings and corporate executives.
It works for all of us. Ken Nottingham, an employee
of General Motors in Indiana, usually had lunch
at the company cafeteria. He noticed that the woman
who worked behind the counter always had a scowl on
her face. “She had been making sandwiches for about
two hours and I was just another sandwich to her. I told
her what I wanted. She weighed out the ham on a little
scale, then she gave me one leaf of lettuce, a few potato
chips and handed them to me.
“The next day I went through the same line. Same
woman, same scowl. The only difference was I noticed
her name tag. I smiled and said, ‘Hello, Eunice,’ and
then told her what I wanted. Well, she forgot the scale,
piled on the ham, gave me three leaves of lettuce and
heaped on the potato chips until they fell off the plate.”
We should be aware of the magic contained in a name
and realize that this single item is wholly and completely
owned by the person with whom we are dealing
and nobody else. The name sets the individual apart;
it makes him or her unique among all others. The information
we are imparting or the request we are making
takes on a special importance when we approach the
situation with the name of the individual. From the waitress
to the senior executive, the name will work magic
as we deal with others.
PRINCIPLE 3Remember that a person’s name is to thatperson the sweetest and most importantsound in any language.AN EASY WAY TO BECOME AGOOD CONVERSATIONALISTSome time ago, I attended a bridge party. I don’t play
bridge - and there was a woman there who didn’t play
bridge either. She had discovered that I had once been
Lowell Thomas’ manager before he went on the radio
and that I had traveled in Europe a great deal while
helping him prepare the illustrated travel talks he was
then delivering. So she said: “Oh, Mr. Carnegie, I do
want you to tell me about all the wonderful places you
have visited and the sights you have seen.”
As we sat down on the sofa, she remarked that she and
her husband had recently returned from a trip to Africa.
“Africa!” I exclaimed. “How interesting! I’ve always
wanted to see Africa, but I never got there except for a
twenty-four-hour stay once in Algiers. Tell me, did you
visit the big-game country? Yes? How fortunate. I envy
you. Do tell me about Africa.”
That kept her talking for forty-five minutes. She never
again asked me where I had been or what I had seen.
She didn’t want to hear me talk about my travels. All she
wanted was an interested listener, so she could expand
her ego and tell about where she had been.
Was she unusual? No. Many people are like that.
For example, I met a distinguished botanist at a dinner
party given by a New York book publisher. I had never
talked with a botanist before, and I found him fascinating.
I literally sat on the edge of my chair and listened
while he spoke of exotic plants and experiments in
developing new forms of plant life and indoor gardens (and
even told me astonishing facts about the humble potato).
I had a small indoor garden of my own - and he was
good enough to tell me how to solve some of my problems.
As I said, we were at a dinner party. There must have
been a dozen other guests, but I violated all the canons
of courtesy, ignored everyone else, and talked for hours
to the botanist.
Midnight came, I said good night to everyone and
departed. The botanist then turned to our host and
paid me several flattering compliments. I was “most
stimulating.” I was this and I was that, and he ended by
saying I was a “most interesting conversationalist.”
An interesting conversationalist? Why, I had said
hardly anything at all. I couldn’t have said anything if I
had wanted to without changing the subject, for I didn’t
know any more about botany than I knew about the anatomy
of a penguin. But I had done this: I had listened
intently. I had listened because I was genuinely interested.
And he felt it. Naturally that pleased him. That
kind of listening is one of the highest compliments we
can pay anyone. “Few human beings,” wrote Jack
Woodford in Strangers in Love, “few human beings are
proof against the implied flattery of rapt attention.” I
went even further than giving him rapt attention. I was
“hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise.”
I told him that I had been immensely entertained and
instructed - and I had. I told him I wished I had his
knoledge - and I did. I told him that I should love to
wander the fields with him - and I have. I told him I
must see him again - and I did.
And so I had him thinking of me as a good conversationalist
when, in reality, I had been merely a good listener
and had encouraged him to talk.
What is the secret, the mystery, of a successful business
interview? Well, according to former Harvard president
Charles W. Eliot, “There is no mystery about
successful business intercourse. . . . Exclusive attention
to the person who is speaking to you is very important.
Nothing else is so flattering as that.”
Eliot himself was a past master of the art of listening,
Henry James, one of America’s first great novelists, recalled:
“Dr. Eliot’s listening was not mere silence, but a
form of activity. Sitting very erect on the end of his spine
with hands joined in his lap, making no movement except
that he revolved his thumbs around each other
faster or slower, he faced his interlocutor and seemed to
be hearing with his eyes as well as his ears. He listened
with his mind and attentively considered what you had
to say while you said it. . . . At the end of an interview
the person who had talked to him felt that he had had
his say.”
Self-evident, isn’t it? You don’t have to study for four
years in Harvard to discover that. Yet I know and you
know department store owners who will rent expensive
space, buy their goods economically, dress their windows
appealingly, spend thousands of dollars in advertising
and then hire clerks who haven’t the sense to be
good listeners - clerks who interrupt customers, contradict
them, irritate them, and all but drive them from the
store.
A department store in Chicago almost lost a regular
customer who spent several thousand dollars each year
in that store because a sales clerk wouldn’t listen. Mrs.
Henrietta Douglas, who took our course in Chicago, had
purchased a coat at a special sale. After she had brought
it home she noticed that there was a tear in the lining.
She came back the next day and asked the sales clerk to
exchange it. The clerk refused even to listen to her complaint.
“You bought this at a special sale,” she said. She
pointed to a sign on the wall. “Read that,” she exclaimed.
&quot; &#x27;All sales are final.&#x27;Once you bought it, you
have to keep it. Sew up the lining yourself.”
“But this was damaged merchandise,” Mrs. Douglas
complained.
“Makes no difference,” the clerk interrupted. “Final’s
final &quot;
Mrs. Douglas was about to walk out indignantly,
swearing never to return to that store ever, when she
was greeted by the department manager, who knew her
from her many years of patronage. Mrs. Douglas told her
what had happened.
The manager listened attentively to the whole story,
examined the coat and then said: “Special sales are
‘final’ so we can dispose of merchandise at the end of
the season. But this &#x27;no return’ policy does not apply to
damaged goods. We will certainly repair or replace the
lining, or if you prefer, give you your money back.”
What a difference in treatment! If that manager had
not come along and listened to the Customer, a long-term
patron of that store could have been lost forever.
Listening is just as important in one&#x27;s home life as in
the world of business. Millie Esposito of Croton-on-Hudson,
New York, made it her business to listen carefully
when one of her children wanted to speak with her.
One evening she was sitting in the kitchen with her son,
Robert, and after a brief discussion of something that
was on his mind, Robert said: &quot;Mom, I know that you
love me very much.”
Mrs. Esposito was touched and said: “Of course I love
you very much. Did you doubt it?”
Robert responded: &quot;No, but I really know you love me
because whenever I want to talk to you about something
you stop whatever you are doing and listen to me.”
The chronic kicker, even the most violent critic, will
frequently soften and be subdued in the presence of a
patient, sympathetic listener - a listener who will he silent
while the irate fault-finder dilates like a king cobra
and spews the poison out of his system. To illustrate:
The New York Telephone Company discovered a few
years ago that it had to deal with one of the most vicious
customers who ever cursed a customer service representative.
And he did curse. He raved. He threatened to tear
the phone out by its roots. He refused to pay certain
charges that he declared were false. He wrote letters to
the newspapers. He filed innumerable complaints with
the Public Service Commission, and he started several
suits against the telephone company.
At last, one of the company’s most skillful “trouble-shooters”
was sent to interview this stormy petrel. This
“troubleshooter” listened and let the cantankerous customer
enjoy himself pouring out his tirade. The telephone
representative listened and said “yes” and
sympathized with his grievance.
“He raved on and I listened for nearlv three hours,”
the “troubleshooter” said as he related his experiences
before one of the author’s classes. “Then I went back
and listened some more. I interviewed him four times,
and before the fourth visit was over I had become a
charter member of an organization he was starting. He
called it the ‘Telephone Subscribers’ Protective Association.&#x27;
I am still a member of this organization, and, so
far as I know, I’m the only member in the world today
besides Mr. ----.
&quot;I listened and sympathized with him on every point
that he made during these interviews. He had never had
a telephone representative talk with him that way before,
and he became almost friendly. The point on which
I went to see him was not even mentioned on the first
visit, nor was it mentioned on the second or third, but
upon the fourth interview, I closed the case completely,
he paid all his bills in full, and for the first time in the
history of his difficulties with the telephone company he
voluntarily withdrew his complaints from the Public
Service Commission.”
Doubtless Mr. ----- had considered himself a holy
crusader, defending the public rights against callous exploitation.
But in reality, what he had really wanted was
a feeling of importance. He got this feeling of importance
at first by kicking and complaining. But as soon as
he got his feeling of importance from a representative of
the company, his imagined grievances vanished into
thin air.
One morning years ago, an angry customer stormed
into the office of Julian F. Detmer, founder of the Detmer
Woolen Company, which later became the world’s
largest distributor of woolens to the tailoring trade.
“This man owed us a small sum of money,” Mr. Detmer
explained to me. “The customer denied it, but we
knew he was wrong. So our credit department had insisted
that he pay. After getting a number of letters from
our credit department, he packed his grip, made a trip to
Chicago, and hurried into my office to inform me not
only that he was not going to pay that bill, but that he
was never going to buy another dollar’s worth of goods
from the Detmer Woolen Company.
&quot;I listened patiently to all he had to say. I was tempted
to interrupt, but I realized that would be bad policy, So
I let him talk himself out. When he finally simmered
down and got in a receptive mood, I said quietly: ‘I want
to thank vou for coming to Chicago to tell me about this.
You have done me a great favor, for if our credit department
has annoyed you, it may annoy other good customers,
and that would be just too bad. Believe me, I am far
more eager to hear this than you are to tell it.’
“That was the last thing in the world he expected me
to say. I think he was a trifle disappointed, because he
had come to Chicago to tell me a thing or two, but here
I was thanking him instead of scrapping with him. I assured
him we would wipe the charge off the books and
forget it, because he was a very careful man with only
one account to look after, while our clerks had to look
after thousands. Therefore, he was less likely to be
wrong than we were.
“I told him that I understood exactly how he felt and
that, if I were in his shoes, I should undoubtedly feel
precisely as he did. Since he wasn’t going to buy from
us anymore, I recommended some other woolen houses.
“In the past, we had usually lunched together when
he came to Chicago, so I invited him to have lunch with
me this day. He accepted reluctantly, but when we came
back to the office he placed a larger order than ever
before. He returned home in a softened mood and, wanting
to be just as fair with us as we had been with him,
looked over his bills, found one that had been mislaid,
and sent us a check with his apologies.
&quot;Later, when his wife presented him with a baby boy,
he gave his son the middle name of Detmer, and he
remained a friend and customer of the house until his
death twenty-two years afterwards.”
Years ago, a poor Dutch immigrant boy washed the
windows of a bakery shop after school to help support
his family. His people were so poor that in addition he
used to go out in the street with a basket every day and
collect stray bits of coal that had fallen in the gutter
where the coal wagons had delivered fuel. That boy,
Edward Bok, never got more than six years of schooling
in his life; yet eventually he made himself one of the
most successful magazine editors in the history of American
journalism. How did he do it? That is a long story,
but how he got his start can be told briefly. He got his
start by using the principles advocated in this chapter.
He left school when he was thirteen and became an
office boy for Western Union, but he didn’t for one moment
give up the idea of an education. Instead, he
started to educate himself, He saved his carfares and
went without lunch until he had enough money to buy
an encyclopedia of American biography - and then he
did an unheard-of thing. He read the lives of famous
people and wrote them asking for additional information
about their childhoods. He was a good listener. He
asked famous people to tell him more about themselves.
He wrote General James A. Garfield, who was then running
for President, and asked if it was true that he was
once a tow boy on a canal; and Garfield replied. He
wrote General Grant asking about a certain battle, and
Grant drew a map for him and invited this fourteen-year
old boy to dinner and spent the evening talking to him.
Soon our Western Union messenger boy was corresponding
with many of the most famous people in the
nation: Ralph Waldo Emerson, Oliver Wendell Holmes,
Longfellow, Mrs. Abraham Lincoln, Louisa May Alcott,
General Sherman and Jefferson Davis. Not only did he
correspond with these distinguished people, but as soon
as he got a vacation, he visited many of them as a welcome
guest in their homes. This experience imbued him
with a confidence that was invaluable. These men and
women fired him with a vision and ambition that shaped
his life. And all this, let me repeat, was made possible
solely by the application of the principles we are discussing
here.
Isaac F. Marcosson, a journalist who interviewed
hundreds of celebrities, declared that many people fail
to make a favorable impression because they don’t listen
attentively. “They have been so much concerned with
what they are going to say next that they do not keep
their ears open. . . . Very important people have told me
that they prefer good listeners to good talkers, but the
ability to listen seems rarer than almost any other good
trait .&quot;
And not only important personages crave a good listener,
but ordinary folk do too. As the Reader’s Digest
once said: “Many persons call a doctor when all they
want is an audience,”
During the darkest hours of the Civil War, Lincoln
wrote to an old friend in Springfield, Illinois, asking him
to come to Washington. Lincoln said he had some problems
he wanted to discuss with him. The old neighbor
called at the White House, and Lincoln talked to him for
hours about the advisability of issuing a proclamation
freeing the slaves. Lincoln went over all the arguments
for and against such a move, and then read letters and
newspaper articles, some denouncing him for not
freeing the slaves and others denouncing him for fear he
was going to free them. After talking for hours, Lincoln
shook hands with his old neighbor, said good night, and
sent him back to Illinois without even asking for his
opinion. Lincoln had done all the talking himself. That
seemed to clarify his mind. “He seemed to feel easier
after that talk,” the old friend said. Lincoln hadn’t
wanted advice, He had wanted merely a friendly, sympathetic
listener to whom he could unburden himself.
That’s what we all want when we are in trouble. That is
frequently all the irritated customer wants, and the dissatisfied
employee or the hurt friend.
One of the great listeners of modern times was Sigmund
Freud. A man who met Freud described his manner
of listening: “It struck me so forcibly that I shall
never forget him. He had qualities which I had never
seen in any other man. Never had I seen such concentrated
attention. There was none of that piercing ‘soul
penetrating gaze’ business. His eyes were mild and genial.
His voice was low and kind. His gestures were few.
But the attention he gave me, his appreciation of what I
said, even when I said it badly, was extraordinary,
You&#x27;ve no idea what it meant to be listened to like that.”
If you want to know how to make people shun you and
laugh at you behind your back and even despise you,
here is the recipe: Never listen to anyone for long. Talk
incessantly about yourself. If you have an idea while the
other person is talking, don’t wait for him or her to finish:
bust right in and interrupt in the middle of a sentence.
Do you know people like that? I do, unfortunately;
and the astonishing part of it is that some of them are
prominent.
Bores, that is all they are - bores intoxicated with their
own egos, drunk with a sense of their own importance.
People who talk only of themselves think only of
themselves. And “those people who think only of themselves,”
Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, longtime president
of Columbia University, said, &quot;are hopelessly uneducated.
They are not educated,” said Dr. Butler, “no matter
how instructed they may be.”
So if you aspire to be a good conversationalist, be an
attentive listener. To be interesting, be interested. Ask
questions that other persons will enjoy answering. Encourage
them to talk about themselves and their accomplishments.
Remember that the people you are talking to are a
hundred times more interested in themselves and their
wants and problems than they are in you and your problems.
A person’s toothache means more to that person
than a famine in China which kills a million people. A
boil on one’s neck interests one more than forty earthquakes
in Africa. Think of that the next time you start a
conversation.
PRINCIPLE 4Be a good listener. Encourage others to talkabout themselves.
HOW TO INTEREST PEOPLEEveryone who was ever a guest of Theodore Roosevelt
was astonished at the range and diversity of his knowledge.
Whether his visitor was a cowboy or a Rough
Rider, a New York politician or a diplomat, Roosevelt
knew what to say. And how was it done? The answer
was simple. Whenever Roosevelt expected a visitor, he
sat up late the night before, reading up on the subject in
which he knew his guest was particularly interested.
For Roosevelt knew, as all leaders know, that the royal
road to a person’s heart is to talk about the things he or
she treasures most.
The genial William Lyon Phelps, essayist and professor
of literature at Yale, learned this lesson early in life.
&quot;When I was eight years old and was spending a
weekend visiting my Aunt Libby Linsley at her home in
Stratford on the Housatonic,” he wrote in his essay on
Human Nature, “a middle-aged man called one evening,
and after a polite skirmish with my aunt, he devoted his
attention to me. At that time, I happened to be excited
about boats, and the visitor discussed the subject in a
way that seemed to me particularly interesting. After he
left, I spoke of him with enthusiasm. What a man! My
aunt informed me he was a New York lawyer, that he
cared nothing whatever about boats - that he took not
the slightest interest in the subject. ‘But why then did
he talk all the time about boats?’
&quot; ‘Because he is a gentleman. He saw you were interested
in boats, and he talked about the things he knew
would interest and please you. He made himself agreeable.’ &quot;
And William Lyon Phelps added: &quot;I never forgot my
aunt’s remark.”
As I write this chapter, I have before me a letter from
Edward L. Chalif, who was active in Boy Scout work.
“One day I found I needed a favor,” wrote Mr. Chalif.
“A big Scout jamboree was coming off in Europe, and I
wanted the president of one of the largest corporations
in America to pay the expenses of one of my boys for the
trip.
“Fortunately, just before I went to see this man, I
heard that he had drawn a check for a million dollars,
and that after it was canceled, he had had it framed.
“So the first thing I did when I entered his office was
to ask to see the check. A check for a million dollars! I
told him I never knew that anybody had ever written
such a check, and that I wanted to tell my boys that I had
actually seen a check for a million dollars. He gladly
showed it to me; I admired it and asked him to tell me
all about how it happened to be drawn.”
You notice, don’t you, that Mr. Chalif didn’t begin by
talking about the Boy Scouts, or the jamboree in Europe,
or what it was he wanted? He talked in terms of what
interested the other man. Here’s the result:
“Presently, the man I was interviewing said: ‘Oh, by
the way, what was it you wanted to see me about?’ So I
told him.
“To my vast surprise,” Mr. Chalif continues, “he not
only granted immediately what I asked for, but much
more. I had asked him to send only one boy to Europe,
but he sent five boys and myself, gave me a letter of
credit for a thousand dollars and told us to stay in Europe
for seven weeks. He also gave me letters of introduction
to his branch presidents, putting them at our service,
and he himself met us in Paris and showed us the town.
Since then, he has given jobs to some of the boys whose
parents were in want, and he is still active in our group.
“Yet I know if I hadn’t found out what he was interested
in, and got him warmed up first, I wouldn’t have
found him one-tenth as easy to approach.”
Is this a valuable technique to use in business? Is it?
Let’s see, Take Henry G. Duvernoy of Duvemoy and
Sons, a wholesale baking firm in New York.
Mr. Duvernoy had been trying to sell bread to a certain
New York hotel. He had called on the manager
every week for four years. He went to the same social
affairs the manager attended. He even took rooms in the
hotel and lived there in order to get the business. But he
failed.
“Then,” said Mr. Duvernoy, “after studying human
relations, I resolved to change my tactics. I decided to
find out what interested this man - what caught his enthusiasm.
“I discovered he belonged to a society of hotel executives
called the Hotel Greeters of America. He not only
belonged, but his bubbling enthusiasm had made him
president of the organization, and president of the International
Greeters. No matter where its conventions were
held, he would be there.
“So when I saw him the next day, I began talking
about the Greeters. What a response I got. What a response!
He talked to me for half an hour about the
Greeters, his tones vibrant with enthusiasm. I could
plainly see that this society was not only his hobby, it
was the passion of his life. Before I left his office, he had
‘sold’ me a membership in his organization.
“In the meantime, I had said nothing about bread. But
a few days later, the steward of his hotel phoned me to
come over with samples and prices.
&quot; ‘I don’t know what you did to the old boy,’ the steward
greeted me, ‘but he sure is sold on you!’
“Think of it! I had been drumming at that man for four
years - trying to get his business - and I’d still be drumming
at him if I hadn’t finally taken the trouble to find
out what he was interested in, and what he enjoyed talking
about.”
Edward E. Harriman of Hagerstown, Maryland, chose
to live in the beautiful Cumberland Valley of Maryland
after he completed his military service. Unfortunately,
at that time there were few jobs available in the area. A
little research uncovered the fact that a number of companies
in the area were either owned or controlled by an
unusual business maverick, R. J. Funkhouser, whose
rise from poverty to riches intrigued Mr. Harriman.
However, he was known for being inaccessible to job
seekers. Mr. Harriman wrote:
&quot;I interviewed a number of people and found that his
major interest was anchored in his drive for power and
money. Since he protected himself from people like me
by use of a dedicated and stern secretary, I studied her
interests and goals and only then I paid an unannounced
visit at her office. She had been Mr. Funkhouser’s orbiting
satellite for about fifteen years. When I told her I
had a proposition for him which might translate itself
into financial and political success for him, she became
enthused. I also conversed with her about her constructive
participation in his success. After this conversation
she arranged for me to meet Mr. Funkhouser.
“I entered his huge and impressive office determined
not to ask directly for a job. He was seated behind a large
carved desk and thundered at me, ‘How about it, young
man?&#x27; I said, ‘Mr. Funkhouser, I believe I can make
money for you.’ He immediately rose and invited me to
sit in one of the large upholstered chairs. I enumerated
my ideas and the qualifications I had to realize these
ideas, as well as how they would contribute to his personal
success and that of his businesses.
&quot; &#x27;R. J.,&#x27; as he became known to me, hired me at once
and for over twenty years I have grown in his enterprises
and we both have prospered.”
Talking in terms of the other person’s interests pays
off for both parties. Howard Z. Herzig, a leader in the
field of employee communications, has always followed
this principle. When asked what reward he got from it,
Mr. Herzig responded that he not only received a different
reward from each person but that in general the reward
had been an enlargement of his life each time he
spoke to someone.
PRINCIPLE 5Talk in terms of the other person’s interests.HOW TO MAKE PEOPLE LIKE YOUINSTANTLYI was waiting in line to register a letter in the post office
at Thirty-third Street and Eighth Avenue in New York. I
noticed that the clerk appeared to be bored with the job
-weighing envelopes, handing out stamps, making
change, issuing receipts - the same monotonous grind
year after year. So I said to myself: &quot;I am going to try to
make that clerk like me. Obviously, to make him like
me, I must say something nice, not about myself, but
about him. So I asked myself, ‘What is there about him
that I can honestly admire?’ &quot; That is sometimes a hard
question to answer, especially with strangers; but, in
this case, it happened to be easy. I instantly saw something
I admired no end.
So while he was weighing my envelope, I remarked
with enthusiasm: &quot;I certainly wish I had your head of
hair.”
He looked up, half-startled, his face beaming with
smiles. &quot;Well, it isn’t as good as it used to be,” he said
modestly. I assured him that although it might have lost
some of its pristine glory, nevertheless it was still magnificent.
He was immensely pleased. We carried on a
pleasant little conversation and the last thing he said to
me was: “Many people have admired my hair.”
I’ll bet that person went out to lunch that day walking
on air. I’ll bet he went home that night and told his wife
about it. I’ll bet he looked in the mirror and said: “It is a
beautiful head of hair.”
I told this story once in public and a man asked me
afterwards: “‘What did you want to get out of him?”
What was I trying to get out of him!!! What was I trying
to get out of him!!!
If we are so contemptibly selfish that we can’t radiate
a little happiness and pass on a bit of honest appreciation
without trying to get something out of the other person
in return - if our souls are no bigger than sour crab apples,
we shall meet with the failure we so richly deserve.
Oh yes, I did want something out of that chap. I
wanted something priceless. And I got it. I got the feeling
that I had done something for him without his being
able to do anything whatever in return for me. That is a
feeling that flows and sings in your memory lung after
the incident is past.
There is one all-important law of human conduct. If
we obey that law, we shall almost never get into trouble.
In fact, that law, if obeyed, will bring us countless
friends and constant happiness. But the very instant we
break the law, we shall get into endless trouble. The law
is this: Always make the other person feel important.
John Dewey, as we have already noted, said that the
desire to be important is the deepest urge in human
nature; and William James said: “The deepest principle
in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.” As I
have already pointed out, it is this urge that differentiates
us from the animals. It is this urge that has been
responsible for civilization itself.
Philosophers have been speculating on the rules of
human relationships for thousands of years, and out of
all that speculation, there has evolved only one important
precept. It is not new. It is as old as history. Zoroaster
taught it to his followers in Persia twenty-five
hundred years ago. Confucius preached it in China
twenty-four centuries ago. Lao-tse, the founder of
Taoism, taught it to his disciples in the Valley of the
Han. Buddha preached it on the bank of the Holy
Ganges five hundred years before Christ. The sacred
books of Hinduism taught it a thousand years before
that. Jesus taught it among the stony hills of Judea nineteen
centuries ago. Jesus summed it up in one thought
-probably the most important rule in the world: “Do
unto others as you would have others do unto you.”
You want the approval of those with whom you come
in contact. You want recognition of your true worth. You
want a feeling that you are important in your little world.
You don’t want to listen to cheap, insincere flattery, but
you do crave sincere appreciation. You want your friends
and associates to be, as Charles Schwab put it, “hearty
in their approbation and lavish in their praise.” All of us
want that.
So let’s obey the Golden Rule, and give unto others
what we would have others give unto us,
How? When? Where? The answer is: All the time,
everywhere.
David G. Smith of Eau Claire, Wisconsin, told one of
our classes how he handled a delicate situation when he
was asked to take charge of the refreshment booth at a
charity concert,
“The night of the concert I arrived at the park and
found two elderly ladies in a very bad humor standing
next to the refreshment stand. Apparently each thought
that she was in charge of this project. As I stood there
pondering what to do, me of the members of the sponsoring
committee appeared and handed me a cash
box and thanked me for taking over the project. She
introduced Rose and Jane as my helpers and then ran
off.
&quot;A great silence ensued. Realizing that the cash box
was a symbol of authority (of sorts), I gave the box to
Rose and explained that I might not be able to keep the
money straight and that if she took care of it I would feel
better. I then suggested to Jane that she show two teenagers
who had been assigned to refreshments how to
operate the soda machine, and I asked her to be responsible
for that part of the project.
“The evening was very enjoyable with Rose happily
counting the money, Jane supervising the teenagers, and
me enjoying the concert.”
You don’t have to wait until you are ambassador to
France or chairman of the Clambake Committee of your
lodge before you use this philosophy of appreciation.
You can work magic with it almost every day.
If, for example, the waitress brings us mashed potatoes
when we have ordered French fried, let’s say: “I’m sorry
to trouble you, but I prefer French fried.” She’ll probably
reply, “No trouble at all” and will be glad to change
the potatoes, because we have shown respect for her.
Little phrases such as “I’m sorry to trouble you,”
“Would you be so kind as to ----? &quot; &quot;Won&#x27;t you
please?” &quot; Would you mind?” “Thank you” - little courtesies
like these oil the cogs of the monotonous grind of
everyday life- and, incidentally, they are the hallmark
of good breeding.
Let’s take another illustration. Hall Caine’s novels-The
Christian, The Deemster, The Manxman, among
them - were all best-sellers in the early part of this century.
Millions of people read his novels, countless millions.
He was the son of a blacksmith. He never had
more than eight years’ schooling in his life; yet when he
died he was the richest literary man of his time.
The story goes like this: Hall Caine loved sonnets and
ballads; so he devoured all of Dante Gabriel Rossetti’s
poetry. He even wrote a lecture chanting the praises of
Rossetti’s artistic achievement-and sent a copy to Rossetti
himself. Rossetti was delighted. “Any young man
who has such an exalted opinion of my ability,” Rossetti
probably said to himself, “must be brilliant,” So Rossetti
invited this blacksmith’s son to come to London and act
as his secretary. That was the turning point in Hall
Caine’s life; for, in his new position, he met the literary
artists of the day. Profiting by their advice and inspired
by their encouragement, he launched upon a career that
emblazoned his name across the sky.
His home, Greeba Castle, on the Isle of Man, became
a Mecca for tourists from the far corners of the world,
and he left a multimillion dollar estate. Yet - who knows</li><li>he might have died poor and unknown had he not
written an essay expressing his admiration for a famous
man.
Such is the power, the stupendous power, of sincere,
heartfelt appreciation.
Rossetti considered himself important. That is not
strange, Almost everyone considers himself important,
very important.
The life of many a person could probably be changed
if only someone would make him feel important. Ronald
J. Rowland, who is one of the instructors of our course
in California, is also a teacher of arts and crafts. He wrote
to us about a student named Chris in his beginning
crafts class:
Chris was a very quiet, shy boy lacking in self-confidence,
the kind of student that often does not receive the
attention he deserves. I also teach an advanced class that
had grown to be somewhat of a status symbol and a privilege
for a student to have earned the right to be in it.
On Wednesday, Chris was diligently working at his desk.
I really felt there was a hidden fire deep inside him. I asked
Chris if he would like to be in the advanced class. How I
wish I could express the look in Chris’s face, the emotions
in that shy fourteen-year-old boy, trying to hold back his
tears.
“Who me, Mr. Rowland? Am I good enough?”
“Yes, Chris, you are good enough.”
I had to leave at that point because tears were coming to
my eyes. As Chris walked out of class that day, seemingly
two inches taller, he looked at me with bright blue eyes and
said in a positive voice, “Thank you, Mr. Rowland.”
Chris taught me a lesson I will never forget-our deep
desire to feel important. To help me never forget this rule,
I made a sign which reads “YOU ARE IMPORTANT.&quot; This
sign hangs in the front of the classroom for all to see and to
remind me that each student I face is equally important.
The unvarnished truth is that almost all the people
you meet feel themselves superior to you in some way,
and a sure way to their hearts is to let them realize in
some subtle way that you recognize their importance,
and recognize it sincerely.
Remember what Emerson said: “Every man I meet is
my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him.”
And the pathetic part of it is that frequently those who
have the least justification for a feeling of achievement
bolster up their egos by a show of tumult and conceit
which is truly nauseating. As Shakespeare put it: &quot;. . .
man, proud man,/Drest in a little brief authority,/ . . .
Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven/As make
the angels weep.”
I am going to tell you how business people in my own
courses have applied these principles with remarkable
results. Let’s take the case of a Connecticut attorney (because
of his relatives he prefers not to have his name
mentioned).
Shortly after joining the course, Mr. R----- drove to
Long Island with his wife to visit some of her relatives.
She left him to chat with an old aunt of hers and ther
rushed off by herself to visit some of the younger relatives.
Since he soon had to give a speech professionally
on how he applied the principles of appreciation, he
thought he would gain some worthwhile experience
talking with the-elderly lady. So he looked around the
house to see what he could honestly admire.
“This house was built about 1890, wasn’t it?” he inquired.
“Yes,” she replied, “that is precisely the year it was
built.”
“It reminds me of the house I was born in,” he said.
“It’s beautiful. Well built. Roomy. You know, they don’t
build houses like this anymore.”
“You’re right,” the old lady agreed. “The young folks
nowadays don’t care for beautiful homes. All they want
is a small apartment, and then they go off gadding about
in their automobiles.
“This is a dream house,” she said in a voice vibrating
with tender memories. “This house was built with love.
My husband and I dreamed about it for years before we
built it. We didn’t have an architect. We planned it all
ourselves.&quot;
She showed Mr. R----- about the house, and he expressed
his hearty admiration for the beautiful treasures
she had picked up in her travels and cherished over a
lifetime - paisley shawls, an old English tea set, Wedgwood
china, French beds and chairs, Italian paintings,
and silk draperies that had once hung in a French chateau.
After showing Mr. R----- through the house, she took
him out to the garage. There, jacked up on blocks, was a
Packard car - in mint condition.
&quot;My husband bought that car for me shortly before he
passed on,” she said softly. “I have never ridden in it
since his death. . . . You appreciate nice things, and I’m
going to give this car to you.”
“Why, aunty,” he said, “you overwhelm me. I appreciate
your generosity, of course; but I couldn’t possibly
accept it. I’m not even a relative of yours. I have a new
car, and you have many relatives that would like to have
that Packard.”
“Relatives!” she exclaimed. “Yes, I have relatives who
are just waiting till I die so they can get that car. But
they are not going to get it.”
“If you don’t want to give it to them, you can very
easily sell it to a secondhand dealer,” he told her.
“Sell it!” she cried. “Do you think I would sell this
car? Do you think I could stand to see strangers riding
up and down the street in that car - that car that my
husband bought for me? I wouldn’t dream of selling it.
I’m going to give it to you. You appreciate beautiful
things.&quot;
He tried to get out of accepting the car, but he couldn’t
without hurting her feelings.
This lady, left all alone in a big house with her paisley
shawls, her French antiques, and her memories, was
starving for a little recognition, She had once been
young and beautiful and sought after She had once built
a house warm with love and had collected things from
all over Europe to make it beautiful. Now, in the isolated
loneliness of old age, she craved a little human warmth,
a little genuine appreciation - and no one gave it to her.
And when she found it, like a spring in the desert, her
gratitude couldn’t adequately express itself with anything
less than the gift of her cherished Packard.
Let’s take another case: Donald M. McMahon, who
was superintendent of Lewis and Valentine, nurserymen
and landscape architects in Rye, New York, related
this incident:
“Shortly after I attended the talk on ‘How to Win
Friends and Influence People,’ I was landscaping the
estate of a famous attorney. The owner came out to give
me a few instructions about where he wished to plant a
mass of rhododendrons and azaleas.
“I said, ‘Judge, you have a lovely hobby. I&#x27;ve been
admiring your beautiful dogs. I understand you win a lot
of blue ribbons every year at the show in Madison
Square Garden.’
“The effect of this little expression of appreciation was
striking.
&quot; ‘Yes,’ the judge replied, ‘I do have a lot of fun with
my dogs. Would you like to see my kennel?’
“He spent almost an hour showing me his dogs and
the prizes they had won. He even brought out their
pedigrees and explained about the bloodlines responsible
for such beauty and intelligence.
“Finally, turning to me, he asked: ‘Do you have any
small children?’
&quot; ‘Yes, I do,’ I replied, ‘I have a son.’
&quot; ‘Well, wouldn’t he like a puppy?’ the judge inquired.
&quot; ‘Oh, yes, he’d be tickled pink.’
&quot; ‘All right, I’m going to give him one,&#x27; the . judge announced.
He started to tell me how to feed the puppy. Then he
paused. ‘You’ll forget it if I tell you. I’ll write it out.’ So
the judge went in the house, typed out the pedigree and
feeding instructions, and gave me a puppy worth several
hundred dollars and one hour and fifteen minutes of his
valuable time largely because I had expressed my honest
admiration for his hobby and achievements.”
George Eastman, of Kodak fame, invented the transparent
film that made motion pictures possible, amassed
a fortune of a hundred million dollars, and made himself
one of the most famous businessmen on earth. Yet in
spite of all these tremendous accomplishments, he
craved little recognitions even as you and I.
To illustrate: When Eastman was building the Eastman
School of Music and also Kilbourn Hall in Rochester,
James Adamson, then president of the Superior
Seating Company of New York, wanted to get the order
to supply the theater chairs for these buildings. Phoning
the architect, Mr. Adamson made an appointment to see
Mr. Eastman in Rochester.
When Adamson arrived, the architect said: &quot;I know
you want to get this order, but I can tell you right now
that you won’t stand a ghost of a show if you take more
than five minutes of George Eastman’s time. He is a
strict disciplinarian. He is very busy. So tell your story
quickly and get out.”
Adamson was prepared to do just that.
When he was ushered into the room he saw Mr. Eastman
bending over a pile of papers at his desk. Presently,
Mr. Eastman looked up, removed his glasses, and
walked toward the architect and Mr. Adamson, saying:
“Good morning, gentlemen, what can I do for you?”
The architect introduced them, and then Mr. Adamson
said: “While we’ve been waiting for you, Mr. Eastman,
I’ve been admiring your office. I wouldn’t mind working
in a room like this myself. I’m in the interior-woodworking
business, and I never saw a more beautiful office in
all my life.”
George Eastman replied: “You remind me of something
I had almost forgotten. It is beautiful, isn’t it? I
enjoyed it a great deal when it was first built. But I come
down here now with a lot of other things on my mind
and sometimes don’t even see the room for weeks at a
time .&quot;
Adamson walked over and rubbed his hand across a
panel. “This is English oak, isn’t it? A little different
texture from Italian oak.”
“Yes,” Eastman replied. “Imported English oak. It
was selected for me by a friend who specializes in fine
woods .&quot;
Then Eastman showed him about the room, commenting
on the proportions, the coloring, the hand carving
and other effects he had helped to plan and execute.
While drifting about the room, admiring the wood-work,
they paused before a window, and George Eastman,
in his modest, soft-spoken way, pointed out some
of the institutions through which he was trying to help
humanity: the University of Rochester, the General Hospital,
the Homeopathic Hospital, the Friendly Home,
the Children’s Hospital. Mr. Adamson congratulated
him warmly on the idealistic way he was using his
wealth to alleviate the sufferings of humanity. Presently,
George Eastman unlocked a glass case and pulled out
the first camera he had ever owned - an invention he
had bought from an Englishman.
Adamson questioned him at length about his early
struggles to get started in business, and Mr. Eastman
spoke with real feeling about the poverty of his childhood,
telling how his widowed mother had kept a boardinghouse
while he clerked in an insurance office. The
terror of poverty haunted him day and night, and he
resolved to make enough money so that his mother
wouldn’t have to work, Mr. Adamson drew him out with
further questions and listened, absorbed, while he related
the story of his experiments with dry photographic
plates. He told how he had worked in an office all day,
and sometimes experimented all night, taking only brief
naps while the chemicals were working, sometimes
working and sleeping in his clothes for seventy-two
hours at a stretch.
James Adamson had been ushered into Eastman’s office
at ten-fifteen and had been warned that he must not
take more than five minutes; but an hour had passed,
then two hours passed. And they were still talking.
Finally, George Eastman turned to Adamson and said,
“The last time I was in Japan I bought some chairs,
brought them home, and put them in my sun porch. But
the sun peeled the paint, so I went downtown the other
day and bought some paint and painted the chairs myself.
Would you like to see what sort of a job I can do
painting chairs? All right. Come up to my home and have
lunch with me and I’ll show you.”
After lunch, Mr. Eastman showed Adamson the chairs
he had brought from Japan. They weren’t worth more
than a few dollars, but George Eastman, now a multimillionaire,
was proud of them because he himself had
painted them.
The order for the seats amounted to $90,000. Who do
you suppose got the order - James Adamson or one of
his competitors?
From the time of this story until Mr. Eastman’s death,
he and James Adamson were close friends.
Claude Marais, a restaurant owner in Rouen, France,
used this principle and saved his restaurant the loss of a
key employee. This woman had been in his employ for
five years and was a vital link between M. Marais and
his staff of twenty-one people. He was shocked to receive
a registered letter from her advising him of her
resignation.
M. Marais reported: &quot;I was very surprised and, even
more, disappointed, because I was under the impression
that I had been fair to her and receptive to her needs.
Inasmuch as she was a friend as well as an employee, I
probably had taken her too much for granted and maybe
was even more demanding of her than of other employees.
&quot;I could not, of course, accept this resignation without
some explanation. I took her aside and said, ‘Paulette,
you must understand that I cannot accept your resignation
You mean a great deal to me and to this company,
and you are as important to the success of this restaurant
as I am.’ I repeated this in front of the entire staff, and I
invited her to my home and reiterated my confidence in
her with my family present.
“Paulette withdrew her resignation, and today I can
rely on her as never before. I frequently reinforce this
by expressing my appreciation for what she does and
showing her how important she is to me and to the restaurant.”
“Talk to people about themselves,” said Disraeli, one
of the shrewdest men who ever ruled the British Empire.
“Talk to people about themselves and they will
listen for hours .&quot;

Part THREEHow to Win People to YourWay of ThinkingYOU CAN’T WIN AN ARGUMENTShortly after the close of World War I, I learned an invaluable
lesson one night in London. I was manager at
the time for Sir Ross Smith. During the war, Sir Ross had
been the Australian ace out in Palestine; and shortly
after peace was declared, he astonished the world by
flying halfway around it in thirty days. No such feat had
ever been attempted before. It created a tremendous
sensation. The Australian government awarded him fifty
thousand dollars; the King of England knighted him;
and, for a while, he was the most talked-about man
under the Union Jack. I was attending a banquet one
night given in Sir Ross’s honor; and during the dinner,
the man sitting next to me told a humorous story which
hinged on the quotation “There’s a divinity that shapes
our ends, rough-hew them how we will.”
The raconteur mentioned that the quotation was from
the Bible. He was wrong. I knew that, I knew it positively.
There couldn’t be the slightest doubt about it.
And so, to get a feeling of importance and display my
superiority, I appointed myself as an unsolicited and unwelcome
committee of one to correct him. He stuck to
his guns. What? From Shakespeare? Impossible! Absurd! That quotation was from the Bible. And he knew it.
The storyteller was sitting on my right; and Frank
Gammond, an old friend of mine, was seated at my left.
Mr. Gammond had devoted years to the study of Shakespeare,
So the storyteller and I agreed to submit the
question to Mr. Gammond. Mr. Gammond listened,
kicked me under the table, and then said: “Dale, you are
wrong. The gentleman is right. It is from the Bible.”
On our way home that night, I said to Mr. Gammond:
“Frank, you knew that quotation was from Shakespeare,”
“Yes, of course,” he replied, &quot;Hamlet, Act Five, Scene
Two. But we were guests at a festive occasion, my dear
Dale. Why prove to a man he is wrong? Is that going to
make him like you? Why not let him save his face? He
didn’t ask for your opinion. He didn’t want it. Why argue
with him? Always avoid the acute angle.” The man who
said that taught me a lesson I’ll never forget. I not
only had made the storyteller uncomfortable, but had
put my friend in an embarrassing situation. How much
better it would have been had I not become argumentative.
It was a sorely needed lesson because I had been an
inveterate arguer. During my youth, I had argued with
my brother about everything under the Milky Way.
When I went to college, I studied logic and argumentation
and went in for debating contests. Talk about being
from Missouri, I was born there. I had to be shown.
Later, I taught debating and argumentation in New
York; and once, I am ashamed to admit, I planned to
write a book on the subject. Since then, I have listened
to, engaged in, and watched the effect of thousands of
arguments. As a result of all this, I have come to the
conclusion that there is only one way under high heaven
to get the best of an argument - and that is to avoid it .
Avoid it as you would avoid rattlesnakes and earthquakes.
Nine times out of ten, an argument ends with each of
the contestants more firmly convinced than ever that he
is absolutely right.
You can’t win an argument. You can’t because if you
lose it, you lose it; and if you win it, you lose it. Why?
Well, suppose you triumph over the other man and shoot
his argument full of holes and prove that he is non compos
mentis. Then what? You will feel fine. But what
about him? You have made him feel inferior. You have
hurt his pride. He will resent your triumph. And -
A man convinced against his will
Is of the same opinion still.</li></ul></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/xiong321123/personal-page/edit/main/docs/看书/HOW to win friends &amp; influence people 1.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_Z9Sw" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_vwxv"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/publicPage/docs/使用指南"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">不分基础，不看天赋，不靠毅力，100%有效的英语快速提分方法！</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/publicPage/docs/看书/HOW to win friends &amp; influence people 2"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">HOW to win friends &amp; influence people 2</div></a></nav></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">文档</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/publicPage/docs/intro">介绍</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">交流</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/JcuDDQ2wpINoTdbsCT1kfQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">微信公众号<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/docusaurus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">个人微信号<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">更多</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/publicPage/blog">Blog</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2023 王雄.</div></div></div></footer></div>
