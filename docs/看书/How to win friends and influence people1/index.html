showroom and asked to see the agency owner, Mr. White. After a short wait, I was ushered into Mr. White’s office. I introduced myself and explained to him that I had bought my car from his dealership because of the recommendations of friends who had had previous dealings with him. I was told that his prices were very competitive and his service was outstanding. He smiled with satisfaction as he listened to me. I then explained the problem I was having with the service department. ‘I thought you might want to be aware of any situation that might tarnish your fine reputation,’</p><p>I added. He thanked me for calling this to his attention and assured me that my problem would be taken care of. Not only did he personal get involved, but he also lent me his car to use while mine was being repaired.”</p><p>Aesop was a Greek slave who lived at the court of</p><p>Croesus and spun immortal fables six hundred years before</p><p>Christ. Yet the truths he taught about human nature are just as true in Boston and Birmingham now as they were twenty-six centuries ago in Athens. The sun can make you take off your coat more quickly than the wind; and kindliness, the friendly approach and appreciation can make people change their minds more readily than all the bluster and storming in the world.</p><p>Remember what Lincoln said: “A drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.”</p><p>PRINCIPLE 4Begin in a friendly way.THE SECRET OF SOCRATES</p><p>In talking with people, don’t begin by discussing the things on which you differ. Begin by emphasizing - and keep on emphasizing - the things on which you agree.</p><p>Keep emphasizing, if possible, that you are both striving for the same end and that your only difference is one of method and not of purpose.</p><p>Get the other person saying “Yes, yes” at the outset.</p><p>Keep your opponent, if possible, from saying “No.”</p><p>A “No” response, according to Professor Overstreet,* is a most difficult handicap to overcome. When you have said “No,” all your pride of personality demands that you remain consistent with yourself. You may later feel that the “No” was ill-advised; nevertheless, there is your precious pride to consider! Once having said a thing, you feel you must stick to it. Hence it is of the very greatest importance that a person be started in the affirmative direction.</p><ul><li>Harry A. Overstreet, lnfluencing Humun Behavior (New York: Norton,</li></ul><p>1925).</p><p>The skillful speaker gets, at the outset, a number of</p><p>“Yes” responses. This sets the psychological process of the listeners moving in the affirmative direction. It is like the movement of a billiard ball. Propel in one direction, and it takes some force to deflect it; far more force to send it back in the opposite direction.</p><p>The psychological patterns here are quite clear. When a person says “No” and really means it, he or she is doing far more than saying a word of two letters. The entire organism - glandular, nervous, muscular - gathers itself together into a condition of rejection. There is, usually in minute but sometimes in observable degree, a physical withdrawal or readiness for withdrawal. The whole neuromuscular system, in short, sets itself on guard against acceptance. When, to the contrary, a person says “Yes,” none of the withdrawal activities takes place. The organism is in a forward - moving, accepting, open attitude. Hence the more “Yeses” we can, at the very outset, induce, the more likely we are to succeed in capturing the attention for our ultimate proposal.</p><p>It is a very simple technique - this yes response. And yet, how much it is neglected! It often seems as if people get a sense of their own importance by antagonizing others at the outset.</p><p>Get a student to say “No” at the beginning, or a customer, child, husband, or wife, and it takes the wisdom and the patience of angels to transform that bristling negative into an affirmative.</p><p>The use of this “yes, yes” technique enabled James</p><p>Eberson, who was a teller in the Greenwich Savings</p><p>Bank, in New York City, to secure a prospective customer who might otherwise have been lost.</p><p>“This man came in to open an account,” said Mr.</p><p>Eberson, “and I gave him our usual form to fill out. Some of the questions he answered willingly, but there were others he flatly refused to answer.</p><p>“Before I began the study of human relations, I would have told this prospective depositor that if he refused to give the bank this information, we should have to refuse to accept this account. I am ashamed that I have been guilty of doing that very thing in the past. Naturally, an ultimatum like that made me feel good. I had shown who was boss, that the bank’s rules and regulations couldn’t be flouted. But that sort of attitude certainly didn’t give a feeling of welcome and importance to the man who had walked in to give us his patronage.</p><p>“I resolved this morning to use a little horse sense. I resolved not to talk about what the bank wanted but about what the customer wanted. And above all else, I was determined to get him saying ‘yes, yes’ from the very start. So I agreed with him. I told him the information he refused to give was not absolutely necessary.</p><p>&quot; ‘However,’ I said, ‘suppose you have money in this bank at your death. Wouldn’t you like to have the bank transfer it to your next of kin, who is entitled to it according to law?’</p><p>&quot; ‘Yes, of course,’ he replied.</p><p>&quot; ‘Don’t you think,’ I continued, ‘that it would be a good idea to give us the name of your next of kin so that, in the event of your death, we could carry out your wishes without error or delay?’</p><p>“Again he said, ‘Yes.’</p><p>“The young man’s attitude softened and changed when he realized that we weren’t asking for this information for our sake but for his sake. Before leaving the bank, this young man not only gave me complete information about himself but he opened, at my suggestion, a trust account, naming his mother as the beneficiary for his account, and he had gladly answered all the questions concerning his mother also.</p><p>&quot;I found that by getting him to say ‘yes, yes’ from the outset, he forgot the issue at stake and was happy to do all the things I suggested.”</p><p>Joseph Allison, a sales representative for Westinghouse</p><p>Electric Company, had this story to tell: “There was a man in my territory that our company was most eager to sell to. My predecessor had called on him for ten years without selling anything When I took over the territory, I called steadily for three years without getting an order. Finally, after thirteen years of calls and sales talk, we sold him a few motors. If these proved to be all right, an order for several hundred more would follow.</p><p>Such was my expectation,</p><p>“Right? I knew they would be all right. So when I called three weeks later, I was in high spirits.</p><p>“The chief engineer greeted me with this shocking announcement: ‘Allison, I can’t buy the remainder of the motors from you.’</p><p>&quot; ‘Why?’ I asked in amazement. ‘Why?’</p><p>&quot; ‘Because your motors are too hot. I can’t put my hand on them,’</p><p>&quot;I knew it wouldn’t do any good to argue. I had tried that sort of thing too long. So I thought of getting the</p><p>&#x27;yes, yes&#x27; response.</p><p>&quot; ‘Well, now look, Mr. Smith,’ I said. ‘I agree with you a hundred percent; if those motors are running too hot, you ought not to buy any more of them. You must have motors that won’t run any hotter than standards set by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association. Isn’t that so?’</p><p>“He agreed it was. I had gotten my first ‘yes.’</p><p>&quot; ‘The Electrical Manufacturers Association regulations say that a properly designed motor may have a temperature of 72 degrees Fahrenheit above room temperature.</p><p>Is that correct?’</p><p>&quot; ‘Yes,’ he agreed. ‘That’s quite correct. But your motors are much hotter.’</p><p>&quot;I didn’t argue with him. I merely asked: ‘How hot is the mill room?’</p><p>&quot; ‘Oh,’ he said, ‘about 75 degrees Fahrenheit.’</p><p>&quot; ‘Well,’ I replied, ‘if the mill room is 75 degrees and you add 72 to that, that makes a total of 147 degrees</p><p>Fahrenheit. Wouldn’t you scald your hand if you held it under a spigot of hot water at a temperature of 147 degrees</p><p>Fahrenheit?’</p><p>“Again he had to say ‘yes.’</p><p>&quot; ‘Well,’ I suggested, ‘wouldn’t it he a good idea to keep your hands off those motors?’</p><p>&quot; ‘Well, I guess you’re right,’ he admitted. We continued to chat for a while. Then he called his secretary and lined up approximately $35,000 worth of business for the ensuing month.</p><p>“It took me years and cost me countless thousands of dollars in lost business before I finally learned that it doesn’t pay to argue, that it is much more profitable and much more interesting to look at things from the other person’s viewpoint and try to get that person saying ‘yes, yes.&#x27; &quot;</p><p>Eddie Snow, who sponsors our courses in Oakland,</p><p>California, tells how he became a good customer of a shop because the proprietor got him to say “yes, yes.”</p><p>Eddie had become interested in bow hunting and had spent considerable money in purchasing equipment and supplies from a local bow store. When his brother was visiting him he wanted to rent a bow for him from this store. The sales clerk told him they didn’t rent bows, so</p><p>Eddie phoned another bow store. Eddie described what happened:</p><p>“A very pleasant gentleman answered the phone. His response to my question for a rental was completely different from the other place. He said he was sorry but they no longer rented bows because they couldn’t afford to do so. He then asked me if I had rented before. I replied, ‘Yes, several years ago.’ He reminded me that I probably paid $25 to $30 for the rental. I said ‘yes’ again.</p><p>He then asked if I was the kind of person who liked to save money. Naturally, I answered ‘yes.’ He went on to explain that they had bow sets with all the necessary equipment on sale for $34.95. I could buy a complete set for only $4.95 more than I could rent one. He explained that is why they had discontinued renting them. Did I think that was reasonable? My ‘yes’ response led to a purchase of the set, and when I picked it up I purchased several more items at this shop and have since become a regular customer.”</p><p>Socrates, “the gadfly of Athens,” was one of the greatest philosophers the world has ever known. He did something that only a handful of men in all history have been able to do: he sharply changed the whole course of human thought; and now, twenty-four centuries after his death, he is honored as one of the wisest persuaders who ever influenced this wrangling world.</p><p>His method? Did he tell people they were wrong? Oh, no, not Socrates. He was far too adroit for that. His whole technique, now called the “Socratic method,” was based upon getting a “yes, yes” response. He asked questions with which his opponent would have to agree. He kept on winning one admission after another until he had an armful of yeses. He kept on asking questions until finally, almost without realizing it, his opponents found themselves embracing a conclusion they would have bitterly denied a few minutes previously.</p><p>The next time we are tempted to tell someone he or she is wrong, let’s remember old Socrates and ask a gentle question - a question that will get the “yes, yes” response.</p><p>The Chinese have a proverb pregnant with the age-old wisdom of the Orient: “He who treads softly goes far.”</p><p>They have spent five thousand years studying human nature, those cultured Chinese, and they have garnered a lot of perspicacity: “He who treads softly goes far.”</p><p>PRINCIPLE 5Get the other person saying “yes, yes”immediately.</p><p>THE SAFETY VALVE IN HANDLINGCOMPLAINTSMust people trying to win others to their way of thinking do too much talking themselves. Let the other people talk themselves out. They know more about their business and problems than you do. So ask them questions.</p><p>Let them tell you a few things.</p><p>If you disagree with them you may be tempted to interrupt.</p><p>But don’t. It is dangerous. They won’t pay attention to you while they still have a lot of ideas of their own crying for expression. So listen patiently and with an open mind. Be sincere about it. Encourage them to express their ideas fully.</p><p>Does this policy pay in business? Let’s see. Here is the story of a sales representative who was forced to try it.</p><p>One of the largest automobile manufacturers in the</p><p>United States was negotiating for a year’s requirements of upholstery fabrics. Three important manufacturers had worked up fabrics in sample bodies. These had all been inspected by the executives of the motor company, and notice had been sent to each manufacturer saying that, on a certain day, a representative from each supplier would be given an opportunity to make a final plea for the contract.</p><p>G.B.R., a representative of one manufacturer, arrived in town with a severe attack of laryngitis. “When it came my turn to meet the executives in conference,” Mr.</p><p>R---- said as he related the story before one of my classes, “I had lost my voice. I could hardly whisper. I was ushered into a room and found myself face to face with the textile engineer, the purchasing agent, the director of sales and the president of the company. I stood up and made a valiant effort to speak, but I couldn’t do anything more than squeak.</p><p>“They were all seated around a table, so I wrote on a pad of paper: ‘Gentlemen, I have lost my voice. I am speechless.’</p><p>&quot; ‘I’ll do the talking for you,’ the president said. He did. He exhibited my samples and praised their good points. A lively discussion arose about the merits of my goods. And the president, since he was talking for me, took the position I would have had during the discussion</p><p>My sole participation consisted of smiles, nods and a few gestures.</p><p>“As a result of this unique conference, I was awarded the contract, which called for over half a million yards of upholstery fabrics at an aggregate value of $1,600,000 - the biggest order I had ever received.</p><p>&quot;I know I would have lost the contract if I hadn’t lost my voice, because I had the wrong idea about the whole proposition. I discovered, quite by accident, how richly it sometimes pays to let the other person do the talking.&#x27;</p><p>Letting the other person do the talking helps in family situations as well as in business. Barbara Wilson&#x27;s relationship with her daughter, Laurie, was deteriorating rapidly. Laurie, who had been a quiet, complacent child, had grown into an uncooperative, sometimes belligerent teenager. Mrs. Wilson lectured her, threatened her and punished her, but all to no avail.</p><p>“One day,” Mrs. Wilson told one of our classes, &quot;I just gave up. Laurie had disobeyed me and had left the house to visit her girl friend before she had completed her chores. When she returned I was about to scream at her for the ten-thousandth time, but I just didn’t have the strength to do it. I just looked at her and said sadly,</p><p>‘Why, Laurie, Why?’</p><p>“Laurie noted my condition and in a calm voice asked,</p><p>‘Do you really want to know?’ I nodded and Laurie told me, first hesitantly, and then it all flowed out. I had never listened to her. I was always telling her to do this or that. When she wanted to tell me her thoughts, feelings, ideas, I interrupted with more orders. I began to realize that she needed me - not as a bossy mother, but as a confidante, an outlet for all her confusion about growing up. And all I had been doing was talking when</p><p>I should have been listening. I never heard her.</p><p>“From that time on I let her do all the talking she wanted. She tells me what is on her mind, and our relationship has improved immeasurably. She is again a cooperative person.”</p><p>A large advertisement appeared on the financial page of a New York newspaper calling for a person with unusual ability and experience. Charles T. Cubellis answered the advertisement, sending his reply to a box number. A few days later, he was invited by letter to call for an interview. Before he called, he spent hours in</p><p>Wall Street finding out everything possible about the person who had founded the business. During the interview, he remarked: &quot;I should be mighty proud to be associated with an organization with a record like yours.</p><p>I understand you started twenty-eight years ago with nothing but desk room and one stenographer. Is that true?”</p><p>Almost every successful person likes to reminisce about his early struggles. This man was no exception.</p><p>He talked for a long time about how he had started with</p><p>$450 in cash and an original idea. He told how he had fought against discouragement and battled against ridicule, working Sundays and holidays, twelve to sixteen hours a day; how he had finally won against all odds until now the most important executives on Wall Street were coming to him for information and guidance. He was proud of such a record. He had a right to be, and he had a splendid time telling about it. Finally, he questioned</p><p>Mr. Cubellis briefly about his experience, then called in one of his vice presidents and said: “I think this is the person we are looking for.”</p><p>Mr. Cubellis had taken the trouble to find out about the accomplishments of his prospective employer. He showed an interest in the other person and his problems.</p><p>He encouraged the other person to do most of the talking</p><ul><li>and made a favorable impression.</li></ul><p>Roy G. Bradley of Sacramento, California, had the opposite problem. He listened as a good prospect for a sales position talked himself into a job with Bradley’s firm, Roy reported:</p><p>“Being a small brokerage firm, we had no fringe benefits, such as hospitalization, medical insurance and pensions.</p><p>Every representative is an independent agent. We don’t even provide leads for prospects, as we cannot advertise for them as our larger competitors do.</p><p>“Richard Pryor had the type of experience we wanted for this position, and he was interviewed first by my assistant, who told him about all the negatives related to this job. He seemed slightly discouraged when he came into my office. I mentioned the one benefit of being associated with my firm, that of being an independent contractor and therefore virtually being self-employed.</p><p>“As he talked about these advantages to me, he talked himself out of each negative thought he had when he came in for the interview. Several times it seemed as though he was half talking to himself as he was thinking through each thought. At times I was tempted to add to his thoughts; however, as the interview came to a close</p><p>I felt he had convinced himself, very much on his own, that he would like to work for my firm.</p><p>“Because I had been a good listener and let Dick do most of the talking, he was able to weigh both sides fairly in his mind, and he came to the positive conclusion, which was a challenge he created for himself. We hired him and he has been an outstanding representative for our firm,”</p><p>Even our friends would much rather talk to us about their achievements than listen to us boast about ours.</p><p>La Rochefoucauld, the French philosopher, said: “If you want enemies, excel your friends; but if you want friends, let your friends excel you.”</p><p>Why is that true? Because when our friends excel us, they feel important; but when we excel them, they - or at least some of them - will feel inferior and envious.</p><p>By far the best-liked placement counselor in the Mid-town</p><p>Personnel Agency in New York City was Henrietta</p><p>G ---- It hadn’t always been that way. During the first few months of her association with the agency, Henrietta didn’t have a single friend among her colleagues. Why?</p><p>Because every day she would brag about the placements she had made, the new accounts she had opened, and anything else she had accomplished.</p><p>&quot;I was good at my work and proud of it,” Henrietta told one of our classes. &quot; But instead of my colleagues sharing my triumphs, they seemed to resent them. I wanted to be liked by these people. I really wanted them to be my friends. After listening to some of the suggestions made in this course, I started to talk about myself less and listen more to my associates. They also had things to boast about and were more excited about telling me about their accomplishments than about listening to my boasting. Now, when we have some time to chat, I ask them to share their joys with me, and I only mention my achievements when they ask.”</p><p>PRINCIPLE 6Let the other person do a great deal of thetalking.</p><p>HOW TO GET COOPERATIONDon’t you have much more faith in ideas that you discover for yourself than in ideas that are handed to you on a silver platter? If so, isn’t it bad judgment to try to ram your opinions down the throats of other people?</p><p>Isn’t it wiser to make suggestions - and let the other person think out the conclusion?</p><p>Adolph Seltz of Philadelphia, sales manager in an automobile showroom and a student in one of my courses, suddenly found himself confronted with the necessity of injecting enthusiasm into a discouraged and disorganized group of automobile salespeople. Calling a sales meeting, he urged his people to tell him exactly what they expected from him. As they talked, he wrote their ideas on the blackboard. He then said: “I’ll give you all these qualities you expect from me. Now I want you to tell me what I have a right to expect from you.” The replies came quick and fast: loyalty, honesty, initiative, optimism, teamwork, eight hours a day of enthusiastic work, The meeting ended with a new courage, a new inspiration - one salesperson volunteered to work fourteen hours a day - and Mr. Seltz reported to me that the increase of sales was phenomenal.</p><p>“The people had made a sort of moral bargain with me, &quot; said Mr. Seltz, “and as long as I lived up to my part in it, they were determined to live up to theirs. Consulting them about their wishes and desires was just the shot in the arm they needed.”</p><p>No one likes to feel that he or she is being sold some- thing or told to do a thing. We much prefer to feel that we are buying of our own accord or acting on our own ideas. We like to be consulted about our wishes, our wants, our thoughts.</p><p>Take the case of Eugene Wesson. He lost countless thousands of dollars in commissions before he learned this truth. Mr. Wesson sold sketches for a studio that created designs for stylists and textile manufacturers.</p><p>Mr. Wesson had called on one of the leading stylists in</p><p>New York once a week, every week for three years. “He never refused to see me,” said Mr. Wesson, “but he never bought. He always looked over my sketches very carefully and then said: ‘No, Wesson, I guess we don’t get together today.&#x27; &quot;</p><p>After 150 failures, Wesson realized he must be in a mental rut, so he resolved to devote one evening a week to the study of influencing human behavior, to help him develop new ideas and generate new enthusiasm.</p><p>He decided on this new approach. With half a dozen unfinished artists’ sketches under his arm, he rushed over to the buyer’s office. &quot;I want you to do me a little favor, if you will,” he said. “‘Here are some uncompleted sketches. Won’t you please tell me how we could finish them up in such a way that you could use them?”</p><p>The buyer looked at the sketches for a while without uttering a word. Finally he said: “Leave these with me for a few days, Wesson, and then come back and see me.”</p><p>Wesson returned three davs later, got his suggestions, took the sketches back to the studio and had them finished according to the buyer’s ideas. The result? All accepted.</p><p>After that, this buyer ordered scores of other sketches from Wesson, all drawn according to the buyer’s ideas.</p><p>“I realized why I had failed for years to sell him,” said</p><p>Mr. Wesson. &quot; I had urged him to buy what I thought he ought to have. Then I changed my approach completely.</p><p>I urged him to give me his ideas. This made him feel that he was creating the designs. And he was. I didn’t have to sell him. He bought.”</p><p>Letting the other person feel that the idea is his or hers not only works in business and politics, it works in family life as well. Paul M. Davis of Tulsa, Oklahoma, told his class how he applied this principle:</p><p>“My family and I enjoyed one of the most interesting sightseeing vacation trips we have ever taken. I had long dreamed of visiting such historic sites as the Civil War battlefield in Gettysburg, Independence Hall in Philadelphia, and our nation’s capital. Valley Forge, James-town and the restored colonial village of Williamsburg were high on the list of things I wanted to see.</p><p>“In March my wife, Nancy, mentioned that she had ideas for our summer vacation which included a tour of the western states, visiting points of interest in New</p><p>Mexico, Arizona, California and Nevada. She had wanted to make this trip for several years. But we couldn’t obviously make both trips.</p><p>“Our daughter, Anne, had just completed a course in</p><p>U.S. history in junior high school and had become very interested in the events that had shaped our country’s growth. I asked her how she would like to visit the places she had learned about on our next vacation. She said she would love to.</p><p>“Two evenings later as we sat around the dinner table,</p><p>Nancy announced that if we all agreed, the summer’s vacation would be to the eastern states, that it would he a great trip for Anne and thrilling for all of us. We all concurred.”</p><p>This same psychology was used by an X-ray manufacturer to sell his equipment to one of the largest hospitals in Brooklyn This hospital was building an addition and preparing to equip it with the finest X-ray department in</p><p>America. Dr. L----, who was in charge of the X-ray department, was overwhelmed with sales representatives, each caroling the praises of his own company’s equipment.</p><p>One manufacturer, however, was more skillful. He knew far more about handling human nature than the others did. He wrote a letter something like this:</p><p>Our factory has recently completed a new line of X-ray equipment. The first shipment of these machines has just arrived at our office. They are not perfect. We know that, and we want to improve them. So we should be deeply obligated to you if you could find time to look them over and give us your ideas about how they can be made more serviceable to your profession. Knowing how occupied you are, I shall be glad to send my car for you at any hour you specify.</p><p>&quot;I was surprised to get that letter,” Dr. L ---- said as he related the incident before the class. “I was both surprised and complimented. I had never had an X-ray manufacturer seeking my advice before. It made me feel important. I was busy every night that week, but I canceled a dinner appointment in order to look over the equipment. The more I studied it, the more I discovered for myself how much I liked it.</p><p>“Nobody had tried to sell it to me. I felt that the idea of buying that equipment for the hospital was my own. I sold myself on its superior qualities and ordered it installed.”</p><p>Ralph Waldo Emerson in his essay “Self-Reliance” stated: “In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty.”</p><p>Colonel Edward M. House wielded an enormous influence in national and international affairs while Woodrow</p><p>Wilson occupied the White House. Wilson leaned upon Colonel House for secret counsel and advice more than he did upon even members of his own cabinet.</p><p>What method did the Colonel use in influencing the</p><p>President? Fortunately, we know, for House himself revealed it to Arthur D. Howden Smith, and Smith quoted</p><p>House in an article in The Saturday Evening Post.</p><p>&quot; ‘After I got to know the President,’ House said, ‘I learned the best way to convert him to an idea was to plant it in his mind casually, but so as to interest him in it - so as to get him thinking about it on his own account.</p><p>The first time this worked it was an accident. I had been visiting him at the White House and urged a policy on him which he appeared to disapprove. But several days later, at the dinner table, I was amazed to hear him trot out my suggestion as his own.’ &quot;</p><p>Did House interrupt him and say, “That’s not your idea. That’s mine” ? Oh, no. Not House. He was too adroit for that. He didn’t care about credit. He wanted results. So he let Wilson continue to feel that the idea was his. House did even more than that. He gave Wilson public credit for these ideas.</p><p>Let’s remember that everyone we come in contact with is just as human as Woodrow Wilson. So let’s use</p><p>Colonel House’s technique.</p><p>A man up in the beautiful Canadian province of New</p><p>Brunswick used this technique on me and won my patronage.</p><p>I was planning at the time to do some fishing and canoeing in New Brunswick. So I wrote the tourist bureau for information. Evidently my name and address were put on a mailing list, for I was immediately overwhelmed with scores of letters and booklets and printed testimonials from camps and guides. I was bewildered.</p><p>I didn’t know which to choose. Then one camp owner did a clever thing. He sent me the names and telephone numbers of several New York people who had stayed at his camp and he invited me to telephone them and discover for myself what he had to offer.</p><p>I found to my surprise that I knew one of the men on his list. I telephoned him, found out what his experience had been, and then wired the camp the date of my arrival.</p><p>The others had been trying to sell me on their service, but one let me sell myself. That organization won.</p><p>Twenty-five centuries ago, Lao-tse, a Chinese sage, said some things that readers of this book might use today: </p><p>&quot; The reason why rivers and seas receive the homage of a hundred mountain streams is that they keep below them. Thus they are able to reign over all the mountain streams. So the sage, wishing to be above men, putteth himself below them; wishing to be before them, he putteth himself behind them. Thus, though his place be above men, they do not feel his weight; though his place be before them, they do not count it an injury.”</p><p>PRINCIPLE 7Let the other person feel that the idea is his orhers.</p><p>A FORMULA THAT WILL WORKWONDERS FOR YOU</p><p>Remember that other people may be totally wrong. But they don’t think so. Don’t condemn them. Any fool can do that. Try to understand them. Only wise, tolerant, exceptional people even try to do that.</p><p>There is a reason why the other man thinks and acts as he does. Ferret out that reason - and you have the key to his actions, perhaps to his personality</p><p>Try honestly to put yourself in his place.</p><p>If you say to yourself, “How would I feel, how would</p><p>I react if I were in his shoes?” you will save yourself time and irritation, for “by becoming interested in the cause, we are less likely to dislike the effect.” And, in addition, you will sharply increase your skill in human relationships.</p><p>“Stop a minute,” says Kenneth M. Goode in his book</p><p>How to Turn People Into Gold, “stop a minute to contrast your keen interest in your own affairs with your mild concern about anything else. Realize then, that everybody else in the world feels exactly the same way!</p><p>Then, along with Lincoln and Roosevelt, you will have grasped the only solid foundation for interpersonal relationships; namely, that success in dealing with people depends on a sympathetic grasp of the other persons’ viewpoint.”</p><p>Sam Douglas of Hempstead, New York, used to tell his wife that she spent too much time working on their lawn, pulling weeds, fertilizing, cutting the grass twice a week when the lawn didn’t look any better than it had when they moved into their home four years earlier. Naturally, she was distressed by his remarks, and each time he made such remarks the balance of the evening was ruined.</p><p>After taking our course, Mr. Douglas realized how foolish he had been all those years. It never occurred to him that she enjoyed doing that work and she might really appreciate a compliment on her diligence.</p><p>One evening after dinner, his wife said she wanted to pull some weeds and invited him to keep her company.</p><p>He first declined, but then thought better of it and went out after her and began to help her pull weeds. She was visibly pleased, and together they spent an hour in hard work and pleasant conversation.</p><p>After that he often helped her with the gardening and complimented her on how fine the lawn looked, what a fantastic job she was doing with a yard where the soil was like concrete. Result: a happier life for both because he had learned to look at things from her point of view</p><ul><li>even if the subject was only weeds.</li></ul><p>In his book Getting Through to People, Dr. Gerald S.</p><p>Nirenberg commented: &quot;Cooperativeeness in conversation is achieved when you show that you consider the other person’s ideas and feelings as important as your own. Starting your conversation by giving the other person the purpose or direction of your conversation, governing what you say by what you would want to hear if you were the listener, and accepting his or her viewpoint will encourage the listener to have an open mind to your ideas.” *</p><ul><li>Dr Gerald S. Nirenberg, Getting Through to People (Englewood Cliffs,</li></ul><p>N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1963), p. 31.</p><p>I have always enjoyed walking and riding in a park near my home. Like the Druids of ancient Gaul, I all but worship an oak tree, so I was distressed season after season to see the young trees and shrubs killed off by needless fires. These fires weren’t caused by careless smokers. They were almost all caused by youngsters who went out to the park to go native and cook a frankfurter or an egg under the trees. Sometimes, these fires raged so fiercely that the fire department had to be called out to fight the conflagration.</p><p>There was a sign on the edge of the park saying that anyone who started a fire was liable to fine and imprisonment, but the sign stood in an unfrequented part of the park, and few of the culprits ever saw it. A mounted policeman was supposed to look after the park; but he didn’t take his duties too seriously, and the fires continued to spread season after season. On one occasion, I rushed up to a policeman and told him about a fire spreading rapidly through the park and wanted him to notify the fire department, and he nonchalantly replied that it was none of his business because it wasn’t in his precinct! I was desperate, so after that when I went riding,</p><p>I acted as a self-appointed committee of one to protect the public domain. In the beginning, I am afraid I didn’t even attempt to see the other people’s point of view. When I saw a fire blazing under the trees, I was so unhappy about it, so eager to do the right thing, that I did the wrong thing. I would ride up to the boys, warn them that they could be jailed for starting a fire, order with a tone of authority that it be put out; and, if they refused, I would threaten to have them arrested. I was merely unloading my feelings without thinking of their point of view.</p><p>The result? They obeyed - obeyed sullenly and with resentment. After I rode on over the hill, they probably rebuilt the fire and longed to burn up the whole park.</p><p>With the passing of the years, I acquired a trifle more knowledge of human relations, a little more tact, a somewhat greater tendency to see things from the other person’s standpoint. Then, instead of giving orders, I would ride up to a blazing fire and begin something like this:</p><p>“Having a good time, boys? What are you going to cook for supper? . . . I loved to build fires myself when I was a boy - and I still love to. But you know they are very dangerous here in the park. I know you boys don’t mean to do any harm, but other boys aren’t so careful.</p><p>They come along and see that you have built a fire; so they build one and don’t put it out when they go home and it spreads among the dry leaves and kills the trees.</p><p>We won’t have any trees here at all if we aren’t more careful, You could be put in jail for building this fire. But</p><p>I don’t want to be bossy and interfere with your pleasure.</p><p>I like to see you enjoy yourselves; but won’t you please rake all the leaves away from the fire right now</p><ul><li>and you’ll be careful to cover it with dirt, a lot of dirt, before you leave, won’t you? And the next time you want to have some fun, won’t you please build your fire over the hill there in the sandpit? It can’t do any harm there.</li></ul><p>. . . Thanks so much, boys. Have a good time.”</p><p>What a difference that kind of talk made! It made the boys want to cooperate. No sullenness, no resentment.</p><p>They hadn’t been forced to obey orders. They had saved their faces. They felt better and I felt better because I had handled the situation with consideration for their point of view.</p><p>Seeing things through another person’s eyes may ease tensions when personal problems become overwhelming.</p><p>Elizabeth Novak of New South Wales, Australia, was six weeks late with her car payment. “On a Friday,” she reported, &quot;I received a nasty phone call from the man who was handling my account informing me if I did not come up with $122 by Monday morning I could anticipate further action from the company. I had no way of raising the money over the weekend, so when I received his phone call first thing on Monday morning I expected the worst. Instead of becoming upset I looked at the situation from his point of view. I apologized most sincerely for causing him so much inconvenience and remarked that I must be his most troublesome customer as this was not the first time I was behind in my payments.</p><p>His tone of voice changed immediately, and he reassured me that I was far from being one of his really troublesome customers. He went on to tell me several examples of how rude his customers sometimes were, how they lied to him and often tried to avoid talking to him at all. I said nothing. I listened and let him pour out his troubles to me. Then, without any suggestion from me, he said it did not matter if I couldn’t pay all the money immediately. It would be all right if I paid him</p><p>$20 by the end of the month and made up the balance whenever it was convenient for me to do so.”</p><p>Tomorrow, before asking anyone to put out a fire or buy your product or contribute to your favorite charity, why not pause and close your eyes and try to think the whole thing through from another person’s point of view? Ask yourself: “Why should he or she want to do it?” True, this will take time, but it will avoid making enemies and will get better results - and with less friction and less shoe leather.</p><p>&quot;I would rather walk the sidewalk in front of a person’s office for two hours before an interview,” said</p><p>Dean Donham of the Harvard business school, “than step into that office without a perfectly clear idea of what</p><p>I was going to say and what that person - from my knowledge of his or her interests and motives - was likely to answer.”</p><p>That is so important that I am going to repeat it in italics for the sake of emphasis.</p><p>I would rather walk the sidewalk in front of a person’s office for two hours before an interview than step into that office without a perfectly clear idea of what I was going to say and what that persob - from my knowledge of his or her interests and motives - was likely to answer.</p><p>If, as a result of reading this book, you get only one thing - an increased tendency to think always in terms of the other person’s point of view, and see things from that person’s angle as well as your own - if you get only that one thing from this book, it may easily prove to be one of the stepping - stones of your career.</p><p>PRINCIPLE 8Try honestly to see things from the otherperson’s point of view.WHAT EVERYBODY WANTSWouldn&#x27;t you like to have a magic phrase that would stop arguments, eliminate ill feeling, create good will, and make the other person listen attentively?</p><p>Yes? All right. Here it is: &quot;I don’t blame you one iota for feeling as you do. If I were you I would undoubtedly feel just as you do.”</p><p>An answer like that will soften the most cantankerous old cuss alive. And you can say that and be 100 percent sincere, because if you were the other person you, of course, would feel just as he does. Take Al Capone, for example. Suppose you had inherited the same body and temperament and mind that Al Capone had. Suppose you had had his environment and experiences. You would then be precisely what he was - and where he was. For it is those things - and only those things - that made him what he was. The only reason, for example, that you are not a rattlesnake is that your mother and father weren’t rattlesnakes.</p><p>Youdeserve very little credit for being what you are</p><ul><li>and remember, the people who come to you irritated, bigoted, unreasoning, deserve very little discredit for being what they are. Feel sorry for the poor devils. Pity them. Sympathize with them. Say to yourself: “There, but for the grace of God, go I.”</li></ul><p>Three-fourths of the people you will ever meet are hungering and thirsting for sympathy. Give it to them, and they will love you.</p><p>I once gave a broadcast about the author of Little</p><p>Women, Louisa May Alcott. Naturally, I knew she had lived and written her immortal books in Concord, Massachusetts.</p><p>But, without thinking what I was saying, I spoke of visiting her old home in Concord. New Hampshire.</p><p>If I had said New Hampshire only once, it might have been forgiven. But, alas and alack! I said it twice, I was deluged with letters and telegrams, stinging messages that swirled around my defenseless head like a swarm of hornets. Many were indignant. A few insulting.</p><p>One Colonial Dame, who had been reared in Concord,</p><p>Massachusetts, and who was then living in Philadelphia, vented her scorching wrath upon me. She couldn’t have been much more bitter if I had accused Miss Alcott of being a cannibal from New Guinea. As I read the letter,</p><p>I said to myself, “Thank God, I am not married to that woman.” I felt like writing and telling her that although</p><p>I had made a mistake in geography, she had made a far greater mistake in common courtesy. That was to be just my opening sentence. Then I was going to roll up my sleeves and tell her what I really thought. But I didn’t.</p><p>I controlled myself. I realized that any hotheaded fool could do that - and that most fools would do just that.</p><p>I wanted to be above fools. So I resolved to try to turn her hostility into friendliness. It would be a challenge, a sort of game I could play. I said to myself, &quot;After all, if</p><p>I were she, I would probably feel just as she does.”</p><p>So, I determined to sympathize with her viewpoint.</p><p>The next time I was in Philadelphia, I called her on the telephone. The conversation went something like this:</p><p>ME:Mrs. So-and-So, you wrote me a letter a few weeks ago, and I want to thank you for it.</p><p>SHE: (in incisive, cultured, well-bred tones): To whom have I the honor of speaking?</p><p>ME:I am a stranger to you. My name is Dale Carnegie.</p><p>You listened to a broadcast I gave about Louisa May</p><p>Alcott a few Sundays ago, and I made the unforgivable blunder of saying that she had lived in Concord,</p><p>New Hampshire. It was a stupid blunder, and</p><p>I want to apologize for it. It was so nice of you to take the time to write me.</p><p>SHE :I am sorry, Mr. Carnegie, that I wrote as I did. I lost my temper. I must apologize.</p><p>ME:No! No! You are not the one to apologize; I am. Any school child would have known better than to have said what I said. I apologized over the air the following</p><p>Sunday, and I want to apologize to you personally now.</p><p>SHE :I was born in Concord, Massachusetts. My family has been prominent in Massachusetts affairs for two centuries, and I am very proud of my native state. I was really quite distressed to hear you say that Miss</p><p>Alcott had lived in New Hampshire. But I am really ashamed of that letter.</p><p>ME:I assure you that you were not one-tenth as distressed as I am. My error didn’t hurt Massachusetts, but it did hurt me. It is so seldom that people of your standing and culture take the time to write people who speak on the radio, and I do hope you will write me again if you detect an error in my talks.</p><p>SHE:You know, I really like very much the way you have accepted my criticism. You must be a very nice person.</p><p>I should like to know you better.</p><p>So, because I had apologized and sympathized with her point of view, she began apologizing and sympathizing with my point of view, I had the satisfaction of controlling my temper, the satisfaction of returning kindness for an insult. I got infinitely more real fun out of making her like me than I could ever have gotten out of telling her to go and take a jump in the Schuylkill</p><p>River,</p><p>Every man who occupies the White House is faced almost daily with thorny problems in human relations.</p><p>President Taft was no exception, and he learned from experience the enormous chemical value of sympathy in neutralizing the acid of hard feelings. In his book Ethics in Service, Taft gives rather an amusing illustration of how he softened the ire of a disappointed and ambitious mother.</p><p>“A lady in Washington,” wrote Taft, “whose husband had some political influence, came and labored with me for six weeks or more to appoint her son to a position.</p><p>She secured the aid of Senators and Congressmen in formidable number and came with them to see that they spoke with emphasis. The place was one requiring technical qualification, and following the recommendation of the head of the Bureau, I appointed somebody else. I then received a letter from the mother, saying that I was most ungrateful, since I declined to make her a happy woman as I could have done by a turn of my hand. She complained further that she had labored with her state delegation and got all the votes for an administration bill in which I was especially interested and this was the way I had rewarded her.</p><p>“When you get a letter like that, the first thing you do is to think how you can be severe with a person who has committed an impropriety, or even been a little impertinent.</p><p>Then you may compose an answer. Then if you are wise, you will put the letter in a drawer and lock the drawer. Take it out in the course of two days - such communications will always bear two days’ delay in answering</p><ul><li>and when you take it out after that interval, you will not send it. That is just the course I took. After that,</li></ul><p>I sat down and wrote her just as polite a letter as I could, telling her I realized a mother’s disappointment under such circumstances, but that really the appointment was not left to my mere personal preference, that I had to select a man with technical qualifications, and had, therefore, to follow the recommendations of the head of the Bureau. I expressed the hope that her son would go on to accomplish what she had hoped for him in the position which he then had. That mollified her and she wrote me a note saying she was sorry she had written as she had.</p><p>“But the appointment I sent in was not confirmed at once, and after an interval I received a letter which purported to come from her husband, though it was in the the same handwriting as all the others. I was therein advised that, due to the nervous prostration that had followed her disappointment in this case, she had to take to her bed and had developed a most serious case of cancer of the stomach. Would I not restore her to health by withdrawing the first name and replacing it by her son’s? I had to write another letter, this one to the husband, to say that I hoped the diagnosis would prove to be inaccurate, that I sympathized with him in the sorrow he must have in the serious illness of his wife, but that it was impossible to withdraw the name sent in. The man whom I appointed was confirmed, and within two days after I received that letter, we gave a musicale at the</p><p>White House. The first two people to greet Mrs. Taft and me were this husband and wife, though the wife had so recently been in articulo mortis.&quot;</p><p>Jay Mangum represented an elevator-escalator main-tenance company in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which had the maintenance contract for the escalators in one of Tulsa’s leading hotels. The hotel manager did not want to shut down the escalator for more than two hours at a time because he did not want to inconvenience the hotel’s guests. The repair that had to be made would take at least eight hours, and his company did not always have a specially qualified mechanic available at the convenience of the hotel.</p><p>When Mr. Mangum was able to schedule a top-flight mechanic for this job, he telephoned the hotel manager and instead of arguing with him to give him the necessary time, he said:</p><p>“Rick, I know your hotel is quite busy and you would like to keep the escalator shutdown time to a minimum.</p><p>I understand your concern about this, and we want to do everything possible to accommodate you. However, our diagnosis of the situation shows that if we do not do a complete job now, your escalator may suffer more serious damage and that would cause a much longer shutdown.</p><p>I know you would not want to inconvenience your guests for several days.”</p><p>The manager had to agree that an eight-hour shut down was more desirable than several days&#x27;. By sympathizing with the manager’s desire to keep his patrons happy, Mr. Mangum was able to win the hotel manager to his way of thinking easily and without rancor.</p><p>Joyce Norris, a piano teacher in St, Louis, Missouri, told of how she had handled a problem piano teachers often have with teenage girls. Babette had exceptionally long fingernails. This is a serious handicap to anyone who wants to develop proper piano-playing habits.</p><p>Mrs. Norris reported: “I knew her long fingernails would be a barrier for her in her desire to play well.</p><p>During our discussions prior to her starting her lessons with me, I did not mention anything to her about her nails. I didn’t want to discourage her from taking lessons, and I also knew she would not want to lose that which she took so much pride in and such great care to make attractive.</p><p>“After her first lesson, when I felt the time was right,</p><p>I said: ‘Babette, you have attractive hands and beautiful fingernails. If you want to play the piano as well as you are capable of and as well as you would like to, you would be surprised how much quicker and easier it would be for you, if you would trim your nails shorter.</p><p>Just think about it, Okay?’ She made a face which was definitely negative. I also talked to her mother about this situation, again mentioning how lovely her nails were.</p><p>Another negative reaction. It was obvious that Babette’s beautifully manicured nails were important to her.</p><p>“The following week Babette returned for her second lesson. Much to my surprise, the fingernails had been trimmed. I complimented her and praised her for making such a sacrifice. I also thanked her mother for influencing</p><p>Babette to cut her nails. Her reply was ‘Oh, I had nothing to do with it. Babette decided to do it on her own, and this is the first time she has ever trimmed her nails for anyone.’ &quot;</p><p>Did Mrs. Norris threaten Babette? Did she say she would refuse to teach a student with long fingernails?</p><p>No, she did not. She let Babette know that her finger- nails were a thing of beauty and it would be a sacrifice to cut them. She implied, “I sympathize with you - I know it won’t be easy, but it will pay off in your better musical development.”</p><p>Sol Hurok was probably America’s number one impresario.</p><p>For almost half a century he handled artists - such world-famous artists as Chaliapin, Isadora Duncan, and</p><p>Pavlova. Mr. Hurok told me that one of the first lessons he had learned in dealing with his temperamental stars was the’ necessity for sympathy, sympathy and more sympathy with their idiosyncrasies.</p><p>For three years, he was impresario for Feodor Chaliapin - one of the greatest bassos who ever thrilled the ritzy boxholders at the Metropolitan, Yet Chaliapin was a constant problem. He carried on like a spoiled child.</p><p>To put it in Mr. Hurok’s own inimitable phrase: “He was a hell of a fellow in every way.”</p><p>For example, Chaliapin would call up Mr. Hurok about noun of the day he was going to sing and say, “Sol,</p><p>I feel terrible. My throat is like raw hamburger. It is impossible for me to sing tonight.” Did Mr. Hurok argue with him? Oh, no. He knew that an entrepreneur couldn’t handle artists that way. So he would rush over to Chaliapin’s hotel, dripping with sympathy. “What a pity, &quot;he would mourn. “What a pity! My poor fellow.</p><p>Of course, you cannot sing. I will cancel the engagement at once. It will only cost you a couple of thousand dollars, but that is nothing in comparison to your reputation.&quot;</p><p>Then Chaliapin would sigh and say, “Perhaps you had better come over later in the day. Come at five and see how I feel then.”</p><p>At five o’clock, Mr. Hurok would again rush to his hotel, dripping with sympathy. Again he would insist on canceling the engagement and again Chaliapin would sigh and say, “Well, maybe you had better come to see me later. I may be better then.”</p><p>At seven-thirty the great basso would consent to sing, only with the understanding that Mr. Hurok would walk out on the stage of the Metropolitan and announce that</p><p>Chaliapin had a very bad cold and was not in good voice.</p><p>Mr. Hurok would lie and say he would do it, for he knew that was the only way to get the basso out on the stage.</p><p>Dr. Arthur I. Gates said in his splendid book Educational</p><p>Psychology: “Sympathy the human species universally craves. The child eagerly displays his injury; or even inflicts a cut or bruise in order to reap abundant sympathy. For the same purpose adults . . . show their bruises, relate their accidents, illness, especially details of surgical operations. ‘Self-pity’ for misfortunes real or imaginary is in some measure, practically a universal practice.&quot;</p><p>So, if you want to win people to your way of thinking, put in practice . . .</p><p>PRINCIPLE 9Be sympathetic with the other person’s ideasand desires.</p><p>AN APPEAL THAT EVERYBODY LIKES</p><p>I was reared on the edge of the Jesse James country out in Missouri, and I visited the James farm at Kearney,</p><p>Missouri, where the son of Jesse James was then living.</p><p>His wife told me stories of how Jesse robbed trains and held up banks and then gave money to the neighboring farmers to pay off their mortgages.</p><p>Jesse James probably regarded himself as an idealist at heart, just as Dutch Schultz, &quot;Two Gun” Crowley, Al</p><p>Capone and many other organized crime “godfathers” did generations later. The fact is that all people you meet have a high regard for themselves and like to be fine and unselfish in their own estimation.</p><p>J. Pierpont Morgan observed, in one of his analytical interludes, that a person usually has two reasons for doing a thing: one that sounds good and a real one.</p><p>The person himself will think of the real reason. You don’t need to emphasize that. But all of us, being idealists at heart, like to think of motives that sound good.</p><p>So, in order to change people, appeal to the nobler motives.</p><p>Is that too idealistic to work in business? Let’s see.</p><p>Let’s take the case of Hamilton J. Farrell of the Farrell-Mitchell</p><p>Company of Glenolden, Pennsylvania. Mr. Farrell had a disgruntled tenant who threatened to move.</p><p>The tenant’s lease still had four months to run; nevertheless, he served notice that he was vacating immediately, regardless of lease.</p><p>&quot;These people had lived in my house all winter - the most expensive part of the year,” Mr. Farrell said as he told the story to the class, “and I knew it would be difficult to rent the apartment again before fall. I could see all that rent income going over the hill and believe me,</p><p>I saw red.</p><p>“Now, ordinarily, I would have waded into that tenant and advised him to read his lease again. I would have pointed out that if he moved, the full balance of his rent would fall due at once - and that I could, and would, move to collect.</p><p>“However, instead of flying off the handle and making a scene, I decided to try other tactics. So I started like this: ‘Mr. Doe,’ I said, ‘I have listened to your story, and I still don’t believe you intend to move. Years in the renting business have taught me something about human nature, and I sized you up in the first place as being a man of your word. In fact, I’m so sure of it that</p><p>I’m willing to take a gamble.</p><p>&quot; ‘Now, here’s my proposition. Lav your decision on the table for a few days and think it over. If you come back to me between now and the first of the month, when your rent is due, and tell me you still intend to move, I give you my word I will accept your decision as final. I will privilege you to move and admit to myself</p><p>I’ve been wrong in my judgment. But I still believe you’re a man of your word and will live up to your contract.</p><p>For after all, we are either men or monkeys - and the choice usually lies with ourselves!’</p><p>“Well, when the new month came around, this gentleman came to see me and paid his rent in person. He and his wife had talked it over, he said - and decided to stay.</p><p>They had concluded that the only honorable thing to do was to live up to their lease.”</p><p>When the late Lord Northcliffe found a newspaper using a picture of him which he didn’t want published, he wrote the editor a letter. But did he say, “Please do not publish that picture of me any more; Idon’t like it”?</p><p>No, he appealed to a nobler motive. He appealed to the respect and love that all of us have for motherhood. He wrote, “Please do not publish that picture of me any more. My mother doesn’t like it.”</p><p>When John D. Rockefeller, Jr., wished to stop newspaper photographers from snapping pictures of his children, he too appealed to the nobler motives. He didn’t, say: “I don’t want their pictures published.” No, he appealed to the desire, deep in all of us, to refrain from harming children. He said: “You know how it is, boys.</p><p>You’ve got children yourselves, some of you. And you know it’s not good for youngsters to get too much publicity.”</p><p>When Cyrus H. K. Curtis, the poor boy from Maine, was starting on his meteoric career, which was destined to make him millions as owner of The Saturday Evening</p><p>Post and the Ladies’ Home Journal, he couldn’t afford to pay his contributors the prices that other magazines paid. He couldn’t afford to hire first-class authors to write for money alone. So he appealed to their nobler motives. For example, he persuaded even Louisa May</p><p>Alcott, the immortal author of Little Women, to write for him when she was at the flood tide of her fame; and he did it by offering to send a check for a hundred dollars, not to her, but to her favorite charity.</p><p>Right here the skeptic may say: “Oh, that stuff is all right for Northcliffe and Rockefeller or a sentimental novelist. But, I’d like to see you make it work with the tough babies I have to collect bills from!”</p><p>You may be right. Nothing will work in all cases - and nothing will work with all people. If you are satisfied with the results you are now getting, why change? If you are not satisfied, why not experiment?</p><p>At any rate, I think you will enjoy reading this true story told by James L. Thomas, a former student of mine:</p><p>Six customers of a certain automobile company refused to pay their bills for servicing. None of the customers protested the entire bill, but each claimed that some one charge was wrong. In each case, the customer had signed for the work done, so the company knew it was right - and said so. That was the first mistake.</p><p>Here are the steps the men in the credit department took to collect these overdue bills. Do you suppose they succeeded?</p><ol><li><p>They called on each customer and told him bluntly that they had come to collect a bill that was long past due.</p></li><li><p>They made it very plain that the company was absolutely and unconditionally right; therefore he, the customer, was absolutely and unconditionally wrong.</p></li><li><p>They intimated that they, the company, knew more about automobiles than he could ever hope to know. So what was the argument about?</p></li><li><p>Result: They argued.</p></li></ol><p>Did any of these methods reconcile the customer and settle the account? Youcan answer that one yourself.</p><p>At this stage of affairs, the credit manager was about to open fire with a battery of legal talent, when fortunately the matter came to the attention of the general manager.</p><p>The manager investigated these defaulting clients and discovered that they all had the reputation of paying their bills promptly, Something was wrong here - something was drastically wrong about the method of collection.</p><p>So he called in James L. Thomas and told him to collect these “uncollectible” accounts.</p><p>Here, in his words, are the steps Mr. Thrrmas took:</p><ol><li>My visit to each customer was likewise to collect a bill long past due - a bill that we knew was absolutely right.</li></ol><p>But I didn’t say a word about that. I explained I had called to find out what it was the company had done, or failed to do.</p><ol start="2"><li><p>I made it clear that, until I had heard the customer’s story, I had no opinion to offer. I told him the company made no claims to being infallible.</p></li><li><p>I told him I was interested only in his car, and that he knew more about his car than anyone else in the world; that he was the authority on the subject.</p></li><li><p>I let him talk, and I listened to him with all the interest and sympathy that he wanted - and had expected.</p></li><li><p>Finally, when the customer was in a reasonable mood,</p></li></ol><p>I put the whole thing up to his sense of fair play. I appealed to the nobler motives. “First,” I said, &quot;I want you to know</p><p>I also feel this matter has been badly mishandled. You’ve been inconvenienced and annoyed and irritated by one of our representatives. That should never have happened. I’m sorry and, as a representative of the company, I apologize.</p><p>As I sat here and listened to your side of the story, I could not help being impressed by your fairness and patience.</p><p>And now, because you are fair - minded and patient, I am going to ask you to do something for me. It’s something that you can do better than anyone else, something you know more about than anyone else. Here is your bill; I know it is safe for me to ask you to adjust it, just as you would do if you were the president of my company. I am going to leave it all up to you. Whatever you say goes.”</p><p>Did he adjust the bill? He certainly did, and got quite a kick out of it, The bills ranged from $150 to $400 - but did the customer give himself the best of it? Yes, one of them did! One of them refused to pay a penny of the disputed charge; but the other five all gave the company the best of it! And here’s the cream of the whole thing: we delivered new cars to all six of these customers within the next two years!</p><p>“Experience has taught me,” says Mr. Thomas, &quot;that when no information can be secured about the customer, the only sound basis on which to proceed is to assume that he or she is sincere, honest, truthful and willing and anxious to pay the charges, once convinced they are correct.</p><p>To put it differently and perhaps mare clearly, people are honest and want to discharge their obligations.</p><p>The exceptions to that rule are comparatively few, and I am convinced that the individuals who are inclined to chisel will in most cases react favorably if you make them feel that you consider them honest, upright and fair.&quot;</p><p>PRINCIPLE 10Appeal to the nobler motives.THE MOVIES DO IT. TV DOES IT.WHY DON’T YOU DO IT?Many years ago, the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin was being maligned by a dangerous whispering campaign. A malicious rumor was being circulated. Advertisers were being told that the newspaper was no longer attractive to readers because it carried too much advertising and too little news. Immediate action was necessary. The gossip had to be squelched.</p><p>But how?</p><p>This is the way it was done.</p><p>The Bulletin clipped from its regular edition all reading matter of all kinds on one average day, classified it, and published it as a book. The book was called One</p><p>Day. It contained 307 pages - as many as a hard-covered book; yet the Bulletin had printed all this news and feature material on one day and sold it, not for several dollars, but for a few cents.</p><p>The printing of that book dramatized the fact that the</p><p>Bulletin carried an enormous amount of interesting reading matter. It conveyed the facts more vividly, more interestingly, more impressively, than pages of figures and mere talk could have done.</p><p>This is the day of dramatization. Merely stating a truth isn’t enough. The truth has to be made vivid, interesting, dramatic. You have to use showmanship. The movies do it. Television does it. And you will have to do it if you want attention.</p><p>Experts in window display know the power of dramazation.</p><p>For example, the manufacturers of a new rat poison gave dealers a window display that included two live rats. The week the rats were shown, sales zoomed to five times their normal rate.</p><p>Television commercials abound with examples of the use of dramatic techniques in selling products. Sit down one evening in front of your television set and analyze what the advertisers do in each of their presentations.</p><p>You will note how an antacid medicine changes the color of the acid in a test tube while its competitor doesn’t, how one brand of soap or detergent gets a greasy shirt clean when the other brand leaves it gray. You’ll see a car maneuver around a series of turns and curves</p><ul><li>far better than just being told about it. Happy faces will show contentment with a variety of products. All of these dramatize for the viewer the advantages offered by whatever is being sold - and they do get people to buy them.</li></ul><p>You can dramatize your ideas in business or in any other aspect of your life. It’s easy. Jim Yeamans, who sells for the NCR company (National Cash Register) in</p><p>Richmond, Virginia, told how he made a sale by dramatic demonstration.</p><p>“Last week I called on a neighborhood grocer and saw that the cash registers he was using at his checkout counters were very old-fashioned. I approached the owner and told him: ‘You are literally throwing away pennies every time a customer goes through your line.’</p><p>With that I threw a handful of pennies on the floor.</p><p>He quickly became more attentive. The mere words should have been of interest to him, but the sound of</p><p>Pennies hitting the floor really stopped him. I was able to get an order from him to replace all of his old machines.”</p><p>It works in home life as well. When the old-time lover</p><p>Proposed to his sweetheart, did he just use words of love? No! He went down on his knees. That really showed he meant what he said. We don’t propose on our knees any more, but many suitors still set up a romantic atmosphere before they pop the question.</p><p>Dramatizing what you want works with children as well. Joe B. Fant, Jr., of Birmingham, Alabama, was having difficulty getting his five-year-old boy and three-year- old daughter to pick up their toys, so he invented a</p><p>“train.” Joey was the engineer (Captain Casey Jones) on his tricycle. Janet’s wagon was attached, and in the evening she loaded all the “coal” on the caboose (her wagon) and then jumped in while her brother drove her around the room. In this way the room was cleaned up</p><ul><li>without lectures, arguments or threats.</li></ul><p>Mary Catherine Wolf of Mishawaka, Indiana, was having some problems at work and decided that she had to discuss them with the boss. On Monday morning she requested an appointment with him but was told he was very busy and she should arrange with his secretary for an appointment later in the week. The secretary indicated that his schedule was very tight, but she would try to fit her in.</p><p>Ms. Wolf described what happened:</p><p>&quot;I did not get a reply from her all week long. Whenever</p><p>I questioned her, she would give me a reason why the boss could not see me. Friday morning came and I had heard nothing definite. I really wanted to see him and discuss my problems before the weekend, so I asked myself how I could get him to see me.</p><p>“What I finally did was this. I wrote him a formal letter.</p><p>I indicated in the letter that I fully understood how extremely busy he was all week, but it was important that I speak with him. I enclosed a form letter and a self- addressed envelope and asked him to please fill it out or ask his secretary to do it and return it to me. The form letter read as follows:</p><p>Ms. Wolf - I will be able to see you on <strong><strong>__</strong></strong> a t</p><p><strong><strong>__</strong></strong>A.M/P.M. I will give you <strong>_</strong>minutes of my time.</p><p>&quot;I put this letter in his in-basket at 11 A.M. At 2 P.M. I checked my mailbox. There was my self-addressed envelope.</p><p>He had answered my form letter himself and indicated he could see me that afternoon and could give me ten minutes of his time. I met with him, and we talked for over an hour and resolved my problems.</p><p>“If I had not dramatized to him the fact that I really wanted to see him, I would probably be still waiting for an appointment.”</p><p>James B. Boynton had to present a lengthy market report.</p><p>His firm had just finished an exhaustive study for a leading brand of cold cream. Data were needed immediately about the competition in this market; the prospective customer was one of the biggest - and most formidable - men in the advertising business.</p><p>And his first approach failed almost before he began.</p><p>“The first time I went in,” Mr. Boynton explains, &quot;I found myself sidetracked into a futile discussion of the methods used in the investigation. He argued and I argued.</p><p>He told me I was wrong, and I tried to prove that</p><p>I was right.</p><p>&quot;I finally won my point, to my own satisfaction - but my time was up, the interview was over, and I still hadn’t produced results.</p><p>&quot;The second time, I didn’t bother with tabulations of figures and data, I went to see this man, I dramatized my facts I.</p><p>“As I entered his office, he was busy on the phone.</p><p>While he finished his conversation, I opened a suitcase and dumped thirty-two jars of cold cream on top of his desk - all products he knew - all competitors of his cream.</p><p>“On each jar, I had a tag itemizing the results of the trade investigation, And each tag told its story briefly, dramatically.</p><p>“What happened?</p><p>“There was no longer an argument. Here was something new, something different. He picked up first one and then another of the jars of cold cream and read the information on the tag. A friendly conversation developed.</p><p>He asked additional questions. He was intensely interested. He had originally given me only ten minutes to present my facts, but ten minutes passed, twenty minutes, forty minutes, and at the end of an hour we were still talking.</p><p>“I was presenting the same facts this time that I had presented previously. But this time I was using dramatization, showmanship - and what a difference it made.”</p><p>PRINCIPLE 11Dramatize your ideas.WHEN NOTHING ELSE WORKS,TRY THISCharles Schwab had a mill manager whose people weren’t producing their quota of work.</p><p>“How is it,” Schwab asked him, “that a manager as capable as you can’t make this mill turn out what it should?”</p><p>&quot;I don’t know,” the manager replied. “I’ve coaxed the men, I’ve pushed them, I’ve sworn and cussed, I’ve threatened them with damnation and being fired. But nothing works. They just won’t produce.”</p><p>This conversation took place at the end of the day, just before the night shift came on. Schwab asked the manager for a piece of chalk, then, turning to the nearest man, asked: “How many heats did your shift make today?”</p><p>&quot;Six.&quot;</p><p>Without another word, Schwab chalked a big figure six on the floor, and walked away.</p><p>When the night shift came in, they saw the “6” and asked what it meant.</p><p>“The big boss was in here today,” the day people said.</p><p>“He asked us how many heats we made, and we told him six. He chalked it down on the floor.”</p><p>The next morning Schwab walked through the mill again. The night shift had rubbed out “6” and replaced it with a big “7.”</p><p>When the day shift reported for work the next morning, they saw a big “7” chalked on the floor. So the night shift thought they were better than the day shift did they? Well, they would show the night shift a thing or two. The crew pitched in with enthusiasm, and when they quit that night, they left behind them an enormous, swaggering &quot;10.&quot; Things were stepping up.</p><p>Shortly this mill, which had been lagging way behind in production, was turning out more work than any other mill in the plant.</p><p>The principle?</p><p>Let Charles Schwab say it in his own words: “The way to get things done,” say Schwab, “is to stimulate competition. I do not mean in a sordid, money-getting way, but in the desire to excel.”</p><p>The desire to excel! The challenge! Throwing down the gauntlet! An infallible way of appealing to people of spirit.</p><p>Without a challenge, Theodore Roosevelt would never have been President of the United States. The Rough</p><p>Rider, just back from Cuba, was picked for governor of</p><p>New York State. The opposition discovered he was no longer a legal resident of the state, and Roosevelt, frightened, wished to withdraw. Then Thomas Collier</p><p>Platt, then U.S. Senator from New York, threw down the challenge. Turning suddenly on Theodore Roosevelt, he cried in a ringing voice: “Is the hero of San Juan Hill a coward?”</p><p>Roosevelt stayed in the fight - and the rest is history.</p><p>A challenge not only changed his life; it had a real effect upon the future of his nation.</p><p>“All men have fears, but the brave put down their fears and go forward, sometimes to death, but always to victory” was the motto of the King’s Guard in ancient</p><p>Greece. What greater challenge can be offered than the opportunity to overcome those fears?</p><p>When Al Smith was governor of New York, he was up against it. Sing Sing, at the time the most notorious pen- itentiary west of Devil&#x27;s Island, was without a warden.</p><p>Scandals had been sweeping through the pristin walls, scandals and ugly rumors. Smith needed a strong man to rule Sing Sing - an iron man. But who? He sent for</p><p>Lewis E. Lawes of New Hampton.</p><p>“How about going up to take charge of Sing Sing?” he said jovially when Lawes stood before him. “They need a man up there with experience.”</p><p>Lawes was flabbergasted. He knew the dangers of</p><p>Sing Sing. It was a political appointment, subject to the vagaries of political whims. Wardens had come and gone</p><ul><li>one had lasted only three weeks. He had a career to consider. Was it worth the risk?</li></ul><p>Then Smith, who saw his hesitation, leaned back in his chair and smiled. “Young fellow,” he said, “I don’t blame you for being scared. It’s a tough spot. It’ll take a big person to go up there and stay.”</p><p>So Smith was throwing down a challenge, was he?</p><p>Lawes liked the idea of attempting a job that called for someone “big.”</p><p>So he went. And he stayed. He stayed, to become the most famous warden of his time. His book 20,000 Years in Sing Singsold into the hundred of thousands of copies.</p><p>His broadcasts on the air and his stories of prison life have inspired dozens of movies. His “humanizing” of criminals wrought miracles in the way of prison reform.</p><p>“I have never found,” said Harvey S. Firestone, founder of the great Firestone Tire and Rubber Company,</p><p>“that pay and pay alone would either bring together or hold good people. I think it was the game itself.”</p><p>Frederic Herzberg, one of the great behavorial scientists, concurred. He studied in depth the work attitudes of thousands of people ranging from factory workers to senior executives. What do you think he found to be the most motivating factor - the one facet of the jobs that was most stimulating? Money? Good working conditions?</p><p>Fringe benefits? No - not any of those. The one major factor that motivated people was the work itself. If the work was exciting and interesting, the worker looked forward to doing it and was motivated to do a good job.</p><p>That is what every successful person loves: the game.</p><p>The chance for self-expression. The chance to prove his or her worth, to excel, to win. That is what makes foot-races and hog-calling and pie-eating contests. The desire to excel. The desire for a feeling of importance.</p><p>PRINCIPLE 12Throw down a challenge.</p><p>I n a N u t s h e l l WIN PEOPLE TO YOUR WAY OF THINKING</p><p>PRINCIPLE 1</p><p>The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.</p><p>PRINCIPLE 2</p><p>Show respect for the other person’s opinions.

It was so unusual, so unexpected, that the secretary blushed in confusion. Then Coolidge said, “Now, don’t get stuck up. I just said that to make you feel good. From now on,</p><p>I wish you would be a little bit more careful with your</p><p>Punctuation.”</p><p>His method was probably a bit obvious, but the psychology was superb. It is always easier to listen to unpleasant things after we have heard some praise of our good points.</p><p>A barber lathers a man before he shaves him; and that is precisely what McKinley did back in 1896, when he was running for President. One of the prominent Republicans of that day had written a campaign speech that he felt was just a trifle better than Cicero and Patrick Henry and Daniel Webster all rolled into one. With great glee, this chap read his immortal speech aloud to McKinley.</p><p>The speech had its fine points, but it just wouldn’t do. It would have raised a tornado of criticism. McKinley didn’t want to hurt the man’s feelings. He must not kill the man’s splendid enthusiasm, and yet he had to say</p><p>&quot;no.&quot; Note how adroitly he did it.</p><p>&quot;My friend, that is a splendid speech, a magnificent speech,” McKinley said. “No one could have prepared a better one. There are many occasions on which it would be precisely the right thing to say, but is it quite suitable to this particular occasion? Sound and sober as it is from your standpoint, I must consider its effect from the party’s standpoint. Now you go home and write a speech along the lines I indicate, and send me a copy of it.”</p><p>He did just that. McKinley blue-penciled and helped him rewrite his second speech, and he became one of the effective speakers of the campaign.</p><p>Here is the second most famous letter that Abraham</p><p>Lincoln ever wrote. (His most famous one was written to</p><p>Mrs. Bixby, expressing his sorrow for the death of the five sons she had lost in battle.) Lincoln probably dashed this letter off in five minutes; yet it sold at public auction in 1926 for twelve thousand dollars, and that, by the way, was more money than Lincoln was able to save during half a century of hard work. The letter was written to General Joseph Hooker on April 26, 1863, during the darkest period of the Civil War. For eighteen months, Lincoln’s generals had been leading the Union</p><p>Army from one tragic defeat to another. Nothing but futile, stupid human butchery. The nation was appalled.</p><p>Thousands of soldiers had deserted from the army, and en the Republican members of the Senate had revolted and wanted to force Lincoln out of the White House.</p><p>“We are now on the brink of destruction,” Lincoln said. It appears to me that even the Almighty is against us. I can hardly see a ray of hope.” Such was the black sorrow and chaos out of which this letter came.</p><p>I am printing the letter here because it shows how</p><p>Lincoln tried to change an obstreperous general when the very fate of the nation could have depended upon the general’s action.</p><p>This is perhaps the sharpest letter Abe Lincoln wrote after he became President; yet you will note that he praised General Hooker before he spoke of his grave faults.</p><p>Yes, they were grave faults, but Lincoln didn’t call them that. Lincoln was more conservative, more diplomatic.</p><p>Lincoln wrote: “There are some things in regard to which I am not quite satisfied with you.” Talk about tact! And diplomacy!</p><p>Here is the letter addressed to General Hooker:</p><p>I have placed you at the head of the Army of the Potomac.</p><p>Of course, I have done this upon what appears to me to be sufficient reasons, and yet I think it best for you to know that there are some things in regard to which I am not quite satisfied with you.</p><p>I believe you to be a brave and skillful soldier, which, of course, I like. I also believe you do not mix politics with your profession, in which you are right. You have confidence in yourself, which is a valuable if not an indispensable quality.</p><p>You are ambitious, which, within reasonable bounds, does good rather than harm, But I think that during General</p><p>Burnside’s command of the army you have taken counsel of your ambition and thwarted him as much as you could, in which you did a great wrong to the country and to a most meritorious and honorable brother officer.</p><p>I have heard, in such a way as to believe it, of your recently saying that both the army and the Government needed a dictator. Of course, it was not for this, but in spite of it, that I have given you command.</p><p>Only those generals who gain successes can set up as dictators. What I now ask of you is military success and I will risk the dictatorship.</p><p>The Government will support you to the utmost of its ability, which is neither more nor less than it has done and will do for all commanders. I much fear that the spirit which you have aided to infuse into the army, of criticizing their commander and withholding confidence from him, will now turn upon you. I shall assist you, as far as I can, to put it down.</p><p>Neither you nor Napoleon, if he were alive again, could get any good out of an army while such spirit prevails in it, and now beware of rashness. Beware of rashness, but with energy and sleepless vigilance go forward and give us victories.</p><p>You are not a Coolidge, a McKinley or a Lincoln. You want to know whether this philosophy will operate for you in everyday business contacts. Will it? Let’s see.</p><p>Let’s take the case of W. P. Gaw of the Wark Company,</p><p>Philadelphia.</p><p>The Wark Company had contracted to build and complete a large office building in Philadelphia by a certain specified date. Everything was going along well; the building was almost finished, when suddenly the sub-contractor making the ornamental bronze work to go on the exterior of this building declared that he couldn’t make delivery on schedule. What! An entire building held up! Heavy penalties! Distressing losses! All because of one man!</p><p>Long-distance telephone calls. Arguments! Heated conversations! All in vain. Then Mr. Gaw was sent to</p><p>New York to beard the bronze lion in his den.</p><p>“Do you know you are the only person in Brooklyn with your name,?&quot; Mr Gaw asked the president of the subcontracting firm shortly after they were introduced.</p><p>The president was surprised. “No, I didn’t know that.”</p><p>“Well,” said Mr. Gaw, “when I got off the train this morning, I looked in the telephone book to get your address, and you’re the only person in the Brooklyn phone book with your name.”</p><p>“I never knew that,” the subcontractor said. He checked the phone book with interest. “Well, it’s an unusual name,” he said proudly. &quot;My family came from</p><p>Holland and settled in New York almost two hundred years ago. &quot; He continued to talk about his family and his ancestors for several minutes. When he finished that,</p><p>Mr. Gaw complimented him on how large a plant he had and compared it favorably with a number of similar plants he had visited. “It is one of the cleanest and neatest bronze factories I ever saw,” said Gaw.</p><p>“I’ve spent a lifetime building up this business,” the subcontractor said, “and I am rather proud of it. Would you like to take a look around the factory?”</p><p>During this tour of inspection, Mr. Gaw complimented the other man on his system of fabrication and told him how and why it seemed superior to those of some of his competitors. Gaw commented on some unusual machines, and the subcontractor announced that he himself had invented those machines. He spent considerable time showing Gaw how they operated and the superior work they turned out. He insisted on taking his visitor to lunch. So far, mind you, not a word had been said about the real purpose of Gaw’s visit.</p><p>After lunch, the subcontractor said, “Now, to get down to business. Naturally, I know why you’re here. I didn’t expect that our meeting would be so enjoyable. You can go back to Philadelphia with my promise that your material will be fabricated and shipped, even if other orders have to be delayed.”</p><p>Mr. Gaw got everything that he wanted without even asking for it. The material arrived on time, and the building was completed on the day the completion contract specified.</p><p>Would this have happened had Mr. Gaw used the hammer-and-dynamite method generally employed on such occasions?</p><p>Dorothy Wrublewski, a branch manager of the Fort</p><p>Monmouth, New Jersey, Federal Credit Union, reported to one of our classes how she was able to help one of her employees become more productive.</p><p>“We recently hired a young lady as a teller trainee.</p><p>Her contact with our customers was very good. She was accurate and efficient in handling individual transactions.</p><p>The problem developed at the end of the day when it was time to balance out.</p><p>“The head teller came to me and strongly suggested that I fire this woman. ‘She is holding up everyone else because she is so slow in balancing out. I’ve shown her over and over, but she can’t get it. She’s got to go.’</p><p>“The next day I observed her working quickly and accurately when handling the normal everyday transactions, and she was very pleasant with our customers.</p><p>“It didn’t take long to discover why she had trouble balancing out. After the office closed, I went over to talk with her. She was obviously nervous and upset. I praised her for being so friendly and outgoing with the customers and complimented her for the accuracy and speed used in that work. I then suggested we review the procedure we use in balancing the cash drawer. Once she realized I had confidence in her, she easily followed my suggestions and soon mastered this function. We have had no problems with her since then.”</p><p>Beginning with praise is like the dentist who begins his work with Novocain. The patient still gets a drilling, but the Novocain is pain-killing. A leader will use . . .</p><p>PRINCIPLE 1Begin with praise and honest appreciation.</p><p>HOW TO CRITICIZE-AND NOT BEHATED FOR ITCharles Schwab was passing through one of his steel mills one day at noon when he came across some of his employees smoking. Immediately above their heads was a sign that said “No Smoking.” Did Schwab point to the sign and say, “Can’t you read.? Oh, no not Schwab. He walked over to the men, handed each one a cigar, and said, “I’ll appreciate it, boys, if you will smoke these on the outside.” They knew that he knew that they had broken a rule - and they admired him because he said nothing about it and gave them a little present and made them feel important. Couldn’t keep from loving a man like that, could you?</p><p>John Wanamaker used the same technique. Wanamaker used to make a tour of his great store in Philadelphia every day. Once he saw a customer waiting at a counter. No one was paying the slightest attention to her. The salespeople? Oh, they were in a huddle at the far end of the counter laughing and talking among themselves.</p><p>Wanamaker didn’t say a word. Quietly slipping behind the counter, he waited on the woman himself and then handed the purchase to the salespeople to be wrapped as he went on his way.</p><p>Public officials are often criticized for not being accessible to their constituents. They are busy people, and the fault sometimes lies in overprotective assistants who don’t want to overburden their bosses with too many visitors. Carl Langford, who has been mayor of Orlando,</p><p>Florida, the home of Disney World, for many years, frequently admonished his staff to allow people to see him. clamed he had an “open-door” policy; yet the citizens of his community were blocked by secretaries and administrators when they called.</p><p>Finally the mayor found the solution. He removed the door from his office! His aides got the message, and the mayor has had a truly open administration since the day his door was symbolically thrown away.</p><p>Simply changing one three-letter word can often spell the difference between failure and success in changing people without giving offense or arousing resentment.</p><p>Many people begin their criticism with sincere praise followed by the word “but” and ending with a critical statement. For example, in trying to change a child’s careless attitude toward studies, we might say, “We’re really proud of you, Johnnie, for raising your grades this term. Butif you had worked harder on your algebra, the results would have been better.” </p><p>In this case, Johnnie might feel encouraged until he heard the word “but.” He might then question the sincerity of the original praise. To him, the praise seemed only to be a contrived lead-in to a critical inference of failure. Credibility would be strained, and we probably would not achieve our objectives of changing Johnnie’s attitude toward his studies.</p><p>This could be easily overcome by changing the word</p><p>&quot;but&quot; to &quot;and.&quot; “We’re really proud of you, Johnnie, for raiseing your grades this term, andby continuing the same conscientious efforts next term, your algebra grade can be up with all the others.”</p><p>Now, Johnnie would accept the praise because there was no follow-up of an inference of failure. We have called his attention to the behavior we wished to change indirectly and the chances are he will try to live up to our expectations.</p><p>Calling attention to one’s mistakes indirectly works wonders with sensitive people who may resent bitterly any direct criticism. Marge Jacob of Woonsocket, Rhode</p><p>Island, told one of our classes how she convinced some sloppy construction workers to clean up after themselves when they were building additions to her house.</p><p>For the first few days of the work, when Mrs. Jacob returned from her job, she noticed that the yard was strewn with the cut ends of lumber. She didn’t want to antagonize the builders, because they did excellent work. So after the workers had gone home, she and her children picked up and neatly piled all the lumber debris in a corner. The following morning she called the foreman to one side and said, “I’m really pleased with the way the front lawn was left last night; it is nice and clean and does not offend the neighbors.” From that day forward the workers picked up and piled the debris to one side, and the foreman came in each day seeking approval of the condition the lawn was left in after a day’s work.</p><p>One of the major areas of controversy between members of the army reserves and their regular army trainers is haircuts. The reservists consider themselves civilians</p><p>(which they are most of the time) and resent having to cut their hair short.</p><p>Master Sergeant Harley Kaiser of the 542nd USAR</p><p>School addressed himself to this problem when he was working with a group of reserve noncommissioned officers.</p><p>As an old-time regular-army master sergeant, he might have been expected to yell at his troops and threaten them. Instead he chose to make his point indirectly.</p><p>“Gentlemen,” he started, “you are leaders. You will be most effective when you lead by example. You must be the example for your men to follow. You know what the army regulations say about haircuts. I am going to get my hair cut today, although it is still much shorter than some of yours. You look at yourself in the mirror, and if you feel you need a haircut to be a good example, we&#x27;ll arrange time for you to visit the post barbership.”</p><p>The result was predictable. Several of the candidates did look in the mirror and went to the barbershop that afternoon and received “regulation” haircuts. Sergeant</p><p>Kaiser commented the next morning that he already could see the development of leadership qualities in some of the members of the squad.</p><p>On March 8, 1887, the eloquent Henry Ward Beecher died. The following Sunday, Lyman Abbott was invited to speak in the pulpit left silent by Beecher’s passing.</p><p>Eager to do his best, he wrote, rewrote and polished his sermon with the meticulous care of a Flaubert. Then he read it to his wife. It was poor - as most written speeches are. She might have said, if she had had less judgment,</p><p>“Lyman, that is terrible. That’ll never do. You’ll put people to sleep. It reads like an encyclopedia. You ought to know better than that after all the years you have been preaching. For heaven’s sake, why don’t you talk like a human being? Why don’t you act natural? You’ll disgrace yourself if you ever read that stuff.”</p><p>That’s what shemight have said. And, if she had, you know what would have happened. And she knew too.</p><p>So, she merely remarked that it would make an excellent article for the North American Review. In other words, she praised it and at the same time subtly suggested that it wouldn’t do as a speech. Lyman Abbott saw the point, tore up his carefully prepared manuscript and preached without even using notes.</p><p>An effective way to correct others’ mistakes is . . .</p><p>PRINCIPLE 2Call attention to people’s mistakes indirectly.</p><p>TALK ABOUT YOUR OWNMISTAKES FIRSTMy niece, Josephine Carnegie, had come to New York to be my secretary. She was nineteen, had graduated from high school three years previously, and her business experience was a trifle more than zero. She became one of the most proficient secretaries west of Suez, but in the beginning, she was - well, susceptible to improvement.</p><p>One day when I started to criticize her, I said to myself: “Just a minute, Dale Carnegie; just a minute. You are twice as old as Josephine. You have had ten thousand times as much business experience. How can you possibly expect her to have your viewpoint, your judgment, your initiative - mediocre though they may be? And just a minute, Dale, what were you doing at nineteen? Remember the asinine mistakes and blunders you made? Remember the time you did this . . . and that . . . ?&quot;</p><p>After thinking the matter over, honestly and impartially,</p><p>I concluded that Josephine’s batting average at nineteen was better than mine had been - and that, I’m sorry to confess, isn’t paying Josephine much of a compliment.</p><p>So after that, when I wanted to call Josephine’s attention to a mistake, I used to begin by saying, “You have made a mistake, Josephine, but the Lord knows, it’s no worse than many I have made. You were not born with judgment. That comes only with experience, and you are better than I was at your age. I have been guilty of so many stupid, silly things myself, I have very little incliion to criticize you or anyone. But don’t you think it would have been wiser if you had done so and so?&quot;</p><p>It isn’t nearly so difficult to listen to a recital of your faults if the person criticizing begins by humbly admitting that he, too, is far from impeccable.</p><p>E. G. Dillistone, an engineer in Brandon, Manitoba,</p><p>Canada, was having problems with his new secretary.</p><p>Letters he dictated were coming to his desk for signature with two or three spelling mistakes per page. Mr. Dillistone reported how he handled this:</p><p>“Like many engineers, I have not been noted for my excellent English or spelling. For years I have kept a little black thumb - index book for words I had trouble spelling. When it became apparent that merely pointing out the errors was not going to cause my secretary to do more proofreading and dictionary work, I resolved to take another approach. When the next letter came to my attention that had errors in it, I sat down with the typist and said: </p><p>&quot; ‘Somehow this word doesn’t look right. It’s one of the words I always have had trouble with. That’s the reason</p><p>I started this spelling book of mine. <!-- -->[I opened the book to the appropriate page.]<!-- --> Yes, here it is. I’m very conscious of my spelling now because people do judge us by our letters and misspellings make us look less professional.</p><p>&quot;I don&#x27;t know whether she copied my system or not, but since that conversation, her frequency of spelling errors has been significantly reduced.”</p><p>The polished Prince Bernhard von Bülow learned the sharp necessity of doing this back in 1909. Von Bülow was then the Imperial Chancellor of Germany, and on the throne satWilhelm II-Wilhelm, the haughty; Wilhelm the arrogant; Wilhelm, the last of the German Kaisers, building an army and navy that he boasted could whip their weight in wildcats</p><p>Then an astonishing thing happened. The Kaiser said things, incredible things, things that rocked the continent and started a series of explosions heard around the world. To make matters infinitely worse, the Kaiser made silly, egotistical, absurd announcements in public, he made them while he was a guest in England, and he gave his royal permission to have them printed in the</p><p>Daily Telegraph. For example, he declared that he was the only German who felt friendly toward the English; that he was constructing a navy against the menace of</p><p>Japan; that he, and he alone, had saved England from being humbled in the dust by Russia and France; that it had been his campaign plan that enabled England’s</p><p>Lord Roberts to defeat the Boers in South Africa; and so on and on.</p><p>No other such amazing words had ever fallen from the lips of a European king in peacetime within a hundred years. The entire continent buzzed with the fury of a hornet’s nest. England was incensed. German statesmen were aghast. And in the midst of all this consternation, the Kaiser became panicky and suggested to Prince von</p><p>Bülow, the Imperial Chancellor, that he take the blame.</p><p>Yes, he wanted von Bülow to announce that it was all his responsibility, that he had advised his monarch to say these incredible things.</p><p>“But Your Majesty,” von Bülow protested, “it seems to me utterly impossible that anybody either in Germany or England could suppose me capable of having advised</p><p>Your Majesty to say any such thing.”</p><p>The moment those words were out of von Bülow&#x27;s mouth, he realized he had made a grave mistake. The</p><p>Kaiser blew up.</p><p>“You consider me a donkey,” he shouted, “capable of blunders you yourself could never have committed!”</p><p>Von Bülow&#x27;s knew that he ought to have praised before he condemned; but since that was too late, he did the next best thing. He praised after he had criticized. And it worked a miracle.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m far from suggesting that,” he answered respectfully.</p><p>“Your Majesty surpasses me in manv respects; not only of course, in naval and military knowledge but above all, in natural science. I have often listened in admiration when Your Majesty explained the barometer, or wireless telegraphy, or the Roentgen rays. I am shamefully ignorant of all branches of natural science, have no notion of chemistry or physics, and am quite incapable of explaining the simplest of natural phenomena.</p><p>But,” von Büllow continued, “in compensation, I possess some historical knowledge and perhaps certain qualities useful in politics, especially in diplomacy.”</p><p>The Kaiser beamed. Von Bulow had praised him. Von</p><p>Bülow had exalted him and humbled himself. The Kaiser could forgive anything after that. “Haven’t I always told you,&quot; he exclaimed with enthusiasm, “that we complete one another famously? We should stick together, and we will!&quot;</p><p>He shook hands with von Bülow, not once, but several times. And later in the day he waxed so enthusiastic that he exclaimed with doubled fists, “If anyone says anything to me against Prince von Bülow, Ishall punch him in the nose.”</p><p>Von Bülow saved himself in time - but, canny diplomat that he was, he nevertheless had made one error: he should have begun by talking about his own shortcomings and Wilhelm’s superiority - not by intimating that the Kaiser wasa half-wit in need of a guardian.</p><p>If a few sentences humbling oneself and praising the other party can turn a haughty, insulted Kaiser into a staunch friend, imagine what humility and praise can do for you and me in our daily contacts. Rightfully used, they will work veritable miracles in human relations.</p><p>Admitting one’s own mistakes - even when one hasn’t corrected them - can help convince somebody to change his behavior. This was illustrated more recently by Clarence</p><p>Zerhusen of Timonium, Maryland, when he discovered his fifteen-year-old son was experimenting with cigarettes.</p><p>“Naturally, I didn’t want David to smoke,” Mr. Zerhusen told us, “but his mother and I smoked cigarettes; we were giving him a bad example all the time. I explained to Dave how I started smoking at about his age and how the nicotine had gotten the best of me and now it was nearly impossible for me to stop. I reminded him how irritating my cough was and how he had been after me to give up cigarettes not many years before.</p><p>&quot;I didn’t exhort him to stop or make threats or warn him about their dangers. All I did was point out how I was hooked on cigarettes and what it had meant to me.</p><p>“He thought about it for a while and decided he wouldn’t smoke until he had graduated from high school. As the years went by David never did start smoking and has no intention of ever doing so.</p><p>“As a result of that conversation I made the decision to stop smoking cigarettes myself, and with the support of my family, I have succeeded.”</p><p>A good leader follows this principle:</p><p>PRINCIPLE 3Talk about your own mistakes beforecriticizing the other person.NO ONE LIKES TO TAKE ORDERS</p><p>I once had the pleasure of dining with Miss Ida Tarbell, the dean of American biographers. When I told her I was writing this book, we began discussing this all-important subject of getting along with people, and she told me that while she was writing her biography of Owen D.</p><p>Young, she interviewed a man who had sat for three years in the same office with Mr. Young. This man declared that during all that time he had never heard Owen</p><p>D. Young give a direct order to anyone. He always gave suggestions, not orders. Owen D. Young never said, for example, “Do this or do that,” or “Don’t do this or don’t do that.” He would say, “You might consider this,” or</p><p>“Do you think that would work?” Frequently he would say, after he had dictated a letter, “What do you think of this?” In looking over a letter of one of his assistants, he would say, “Maybe if we were to phrase it this way it would be better.” He always gave people the opportunity to do things themselves; he never told his assistants to do things; he let them do them, let them learn from their mistakes.</p><p>A technique like that makes it easy for a person to correct errors. A technique like that saves a person’s pride and gives him or her a feeling of importance. It encourages cooperation instead of rebellion.</p><p>Resentment caused by a brash order may last a long time -even if the order was given to correct an obviously bad situation. Dan Santarelli, a teacher at a vocational school in Wyoming, Pennsylvania, told one of our classes how one of his students had blocked the entrance way to one of the school’s shops by illegally parking his car in it. One of the other instructors stormed into the classroom and asked in an arrogant tone, “Whose car is blocking the driveway?&quot; When the student who owned the car responded, the instructor screamed:</p><p>“Move that car and move it right now, or I’ll wrap a chain around it and drag it out of there.”</p><p>Now that student was wrong. The car should not have been parked there. But from that day on, not only did that student resent the instructor’s action, but all the students in the class did everything they could to give the instructor a hard time and make his job unpleasant.</p><p>How could he have handled it differently? If he had asked in a friendly way, “Whose car is in the driveway?” and then suggested that if it were moved, other cars could get in and out, the student would have gladly moved it and neither he nor his classmates would have been upset and resentful.</p><p>Asking questions not only makes an order more palatable; it often stimulates the creativity of the persons whom you ask. People are more likely to accept an order if they have had a part in the decision that caused the order to be issued.</p><p>When Ian Macdonald of Johannesburg, South Africa, the general manager of a small manufacturing plant specializing in precision machine parts, had the opportunity to accept a very large order, he was convinced that he would not meet the promised delivery date. The work already scheduled in the shop and the short completion time needed for this order made it seem impossible for him to accept the order.</p><p>Instead of pushing his people to accelerate their work and rush the order through, he called everybody together, explained the situation to them, and told them how much it would mean to the company and to them if they could make it possible to produce the order on time. Then he started asking questions:</p><p>“Is there anything we can do to handle this order?”</p><p>“Can anyone think of different ways to process it through the shop that will make it possible to take the order?”</p><p>“Is there any way to adjust our hours or personnel assignments that would help?”</p><p>The employees came up with many ideas and insisted that he take the order. They approached it with a “We can do it” attitude, and the order was accepted, produced and delivered on time.</p><p>An effective leader will use . . .</p><p>PRINCIPLE 4Ask questions instead of giving direct orders.LET THE OTHER PERSON SAVE FACE</p><p>Years ago the General Electric Company was faced with the delicate task of removing Charles Steinmetz from the head of a department. Steinmetz, a genius of the first magnitude when it came to electricity, was a failure as the head of the calculating department. Yet the company didn’t dare offend the man. He was indispensable - and highly sensitive. So they gave him a new title. They made him Consulting Engineer of the General Electric</p><p>Company - a new title for work he was already doing - and let someone else head up the department.</p><p>Steinmetz was happy.</p><p>So were the officers of G.E. They had gently maneuvered their most temperamental star, and they had done it without a storm - by letting him save face.</p><p>Letting one save face! How important, how vitally important that is! And how few of us ever stop to think of it! We ride roughshod over the feelings of others, getting our own way, finding fault, issuing threats, criticizing a child or an employee in front of others, without even considering the hurt to the other person’s pride.</p><p>Whereas a few minutes’ thought, a considerate word or two, a genuine understanding of the other person’s attitude, would go so far toward alleviating the sting!</p><p>Let’s remember that the next time we are faced with the distasteful necessity of discharging or reprimanding an employee.</p><p>“Firing employees is not much fun. Getting fired is even less fun.” (I’m quoting now from a letter written me by Marshall A. Granger, a certified public accountant.)</p><p>“Our business is mostly seasonal. Therefore we have to let a lot of people go after the income tax rush is over.</p><p>It’s a byword in our profession that no one enjoys wielding the ax. Consequently, the custom has developed of getting it over as soon as possible, and usually in the following way: ‘Sit down, Mr. Smith. The season’s over, and we don’t seem to see any more assignments for you. Of course, you understood you were only employed for the busy season anyhow, etc., etc.’</p><p>“The effect on these people is one of disappointment and a feeling of being ‘let down.’ Most of them are in the accounting field for life, and they retain no particular love for the firm that drops them so casually.</p><p>“I recently decided to let our seasonal personnel go with a little more tact and consideration. So I call each one in only after carefully thinking over his or her work during the winter. And I’ve said something like this:</p><p>‘Mr. Smith, you’ve done a fine job (if he has). That time we sent you to Newark, you had a tough assignment.</p><p>You were on the spot, but you came through with flying colors, and we want you to know the firm is proud of you. You’ve got the stuff - you’re going a long way, wherever you’re working. This firm believes in you, and is rooting for you, and we don’t want you to forget it.’</p><p>“Effect? The people go away feeling a lot better about being fired. They don’t feel ‘let down.’ They know if we had work for them, we’d keep them on. And when we need them again, they come to us with a keen personal affection.”</p><p>At one session of our course, two class members discussed the negative effects of faultfinding versus the positive effects of letting the other person save face.</p><p>Fred Clark of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, told of an incident that occurred in his company: “At one of our production meetings, a vice president was asking very pointed questions of one of our production supervisors regarding a production process. His tone of voice was aggressive and aimed at pointing out faulty performance on the part of the supervisor. Not wanting to be embarrassed in front of his peers, the supervisor was evasive in his responses. This caused the vice president to lose his temper, berate the supervisor and accuse him of lying.</p><p>“Any working relationship that might have existed prior to this encounter was destroyed in a few brief moments.</p><p>This supervisor, who was basically a good worker, was useless to our company from that time on. A few months later he left our firm and went to work for a competitor, where I understand he is doing a fine job.”</p><p>Another class member, Anna Mazzone, related how a similar incident had occurred at her job - but what a difference in approach and results! Ms. Mazzone, a marketing specialist for a food packer, was given her first major assignment - the test-marketing of a new product.</p><p>She told the class: “When the results of the test came in,</p><p>I was devastated. I had made a serious error in my planning, and the entire test had to be done all over again.</p><p>To make this worse, I had no time to discuss it with my boss before the meeting in which I was to make my report on the project.</p><p>“When I was called on to give the report, I was shaking with fright. I had all I could do to keep from breaking down, but I resolved I would not cry and have all those men make remarks about women not being able to handle a management job because they are too emotional. I made my report briefly and stated that due to an error I would repeat the study before the next meeting. I sat down, expecting my boss to blow up.</p><p>“Instead, he thanked me for my work and remarked that it was not unusual for a person to make an error on a new project and that he had confidence that the repeat survey would be accurate and meaningful to the company.</p><p>He Assured me, in front of all my colleagues, that he had faith in me and I knew I had done my best, and that my lack of experience, not my lack of ability, was the reason for the failure.</p><p>I left that meeting with my head in the air and with the determination that I would never let that boss of mine down again.”</p><p>Even if we are right and the other person is definitely wrong, we only destroy ego by causing someone to lose face. The legendary French aviation pioneer and author</p><p>Antoine de Saint-Exupéry wrote: &quot;I have no right to say or do anything that diminishes a man in his own eyes.</p><p>What matters is not what I think of him, but what he thinks of himself. Hurting a man in his dignity is a crime.”</p><p>A real leader will always follow . . .</p><p>PRINCIPLE 5 Let the other person save face.HOW TO SPUR PEOPLE ONTO SUCCESS</p><p>Pete Barlow was an old friend of mine. He had a dog-and- pony act and spent his life traveling with circuses and vaudeville shows. I loved to watch Pete train new dogs for his act. I noticed that the moment a dog showed the slightest improvement, Pete patted and praised him and gave him meat and made a great to-do about it.</p><p>That’s nothing new. Animal trainers have been using that same technique for centuries.</p><p>Why, I wonder, don’t we use the same common sense when trying to change people that we use when trying to change dogs? Why don’t we use meat instead of a whip? Why don’t we use praise instead of condemnation?</p><p>Let us praise even the slightest improvement. That inspires the other person to keep on improving.</p><p>In his book I Ain’t Much, Baby-But I’m All IGot, the psychologist Jess Lair comments: “Praise is like sunlight to the warm human spirit; we cannot flower and grow without it. And yet, while most of us are only too ready to apply to others the cold wind of criticism, we are somehow reluctant to give our fellow the warm sunshine of praise.” *</p><ul><li>Jess Lair, I Ain’t Much, Baby - But I’m All I Got (Greenwich, Conn.:</li></ul><p>Fawcett, 1976), p . 248.</p><p>I can look back at my own life and see where a few words of praise have sharply changed my entire future.</p><p>Can’t you say the same thing about your life? History is replete with striking illustrations of the sheer witchery raise.</p><p>For example, many years ago a boy of ten was working in a factory in Naples, He longed to be a singer, but his first teacher discouraged him. “You can’t sing,” he said.</p><p>&quot;You haven’t any voice at all. It sounds like the wind in the shutters.”</p><p>But his mother, a poor peasant woman, put her arms about him and praised him and told him she knew he could sing, she could already see an improvement, and she went barefoot in order to save money to pay for his music lessons. That peasant mother’s praise and encouragement changed that boy’s life. His name was Enrico</p><p>Caruso, and he became the greatest and most famous opera singer of his age.</p><p>In the early nineteenth century, a young man in London aspired to be a writer. But everything seemed to be against him. He had never been able to attend school more than four years. His father had been flung in jail because he couldn’t pay his debts, and this young man often knew the pangs of hunger. Finally, he got a job pasting labels on bottles of blacking in a rat-infested warehouse, and he slept at night in a dismal attic room with two other boys - guttersnipes from the slums of</p><p>London. He had so little confidence in his ability to write that he sneaked out and mailed his first manuscript in the dead of night so nobody would laugh at him. Story after story was refused. Finally the great day came when one was accepted. True, he wasn’t paid a shilling for it, but one editor had praised him. One editor had given him recognition. He was so thrilled that he wandered aimlessly around the streets with tears rolling down his cheeks.</p><p>The praise, the recognition, that he received through getting one story in print, changed his whole life, for if it hadn’t been for that encouragement, he might have spent his entire life working in rat-infested factories.</p><p>You may have heard of that boy. His name was Charles</p><p>Dickens.</p><p>Another boy in London made his living as a clerk in a dry-goods store. He had to get up at five o’clock, sweep out the store, and slave for fourteen hours a day. It was sheer drudgery and he despised it. After two years, he could stand it no longer, so he got up one morning and, without waiting for breakfast, tramped fifteen miles to talk to his mother, who was working as a housekeeper.</p><p>He was frantic. He pleaded with her. He wept. He swore he would kill himself if he had to remain in the shop any longer. Then he wrote a long, pathetic letter to his old schoolmaster, declaring that he was heartbroken, that he no longer wanted to live. His old schoolmaster gave him a little praise and assured him that he really was very intelligent and fitted for finer things and offered him a job as a teacher.</p><p>That praise changed the future of that boy and made a lasting impression on the history of English literature.</p><p>For that boy went on to write innumerable best-selling books and made over a million dollars with his pen.</p><p>You’ve probably heard of him. His name: H. G. Wells.</p><p>Use of praise instead of criticism is the basic concept of B. F. Skinner’s teachings. This great contemporary psychologist has shown by experiments with animals and with humans that when criticism is minimized and praise emphasized, the good things people do will be reinforced and the poorer things will atrophy for lack of attention.</p><p>John Ringelspaugh of Rocky Mount, North Carolina, used this in dealing with his children. It seemed that, as in so many families, mother and dad’s chief form of communication with the children was yelling at them. And, as in so many cases, the children became a little worse rather than better after each such session - and so did the parents. There seemed to be no end in sight for this problem.</p><p>Mr. Ringelspaugh determined to use some of the principles he was learning in our course to solve this situation.</p><p>He reported: “We decided to try praise instead of harping on their faults. It wasn’t easy when all we could see were the negative things they were doing; it was really tough to find things to praise. We managed to find something, and within the first day or two some of the really upsetting things they were doing quit happening.</p><p>Then some of their other faults began to disappear. They began capitalizing on the praise we were giving them.</p><p>They even began going out of their way to do things right. Neither of us could believe it. Of course, it didn’t last forever, but the norm reached after things leveled off was so much better. It was no longer necessary to react the way we used to. The children were doing far more right things than wrong ones.” All of this was a result of praising the slightest improvement in the children rather than condemning everything they did wrong.</p><p>This works on the job too. Keith Roper of Woodland</p><p>Hills, California, applied this principle to a situation in his company. Some material came to him in his print shop which was of exceptionally high quality. The printer who had done this job was a new employee who had been having difficulty adjusting to the job. His supervisor was upset about what he considered a negative attitude and was seriously thinking of terminating his services.</p><p>When Mr. Roper was informed of this situation, he personally went over to the print shop and had a talk with the young man. He told him how pleased he was with the work he had just received and pointed out it was the best work he had seen produced in that shop for some time. He pointed out exactly why it was superior and how important the young man’s contribution was to the company,</p><p>Do you think this affected that young printer’s attitude toward the company? Within days there was a complete turnabout. He told several of his co-workers about the conversation and how someone in the company really appreciated good work. And from that day on, he was a loyal and dedicated worker.</p><p>What Mr. Roper did was not just flatter the young printer and say “You’re good.” He specifically pointed out how his work was superior. Because he had singled out a specific accomplishment, rather than just making general flattering remarks, his praise became much more meaningful to the person to whom it was given. Everybody likes to be praised, but when praise is specific, it comes across as sincere - not something the other person may be saying just to make one feel good.</p><p>Remember, we all crave appreciation and recognition, and will do almost anything to get it. But nobody wants insincerity. Nobody wants flattery.</p><p>Let me repeat: The principles taught in this book will work only when they come from the heart. I am not advocating a bag of tricks. I am talking about a new way of life.</p><p>Talk about changing people. If you and I will inspire the people with whom we come in contact to a realization of the hidden treasures they possess, we can do far more than change people. We can literally transform them.</p><p>Exaggeration? Then listen to these sage words from</p><p>William James, one of the most distinguished psychologists and philosophers America has ever produced:</p><p>Compared with what we ought to be, we are only half awake. We are making use of only a small part of our physical and mental resources. Stating the thing broadly, the human individual thus lives far within his limits. He possesses powers of various sorts which he habitually fails to use.</p><p>Yes, you who are reading these lines possess powers of various sorts which you habitually fail to use; and one of these powers you are probably not using to the fullest extent is your magic ability to praise people and inspire them with a realization of their latent possibilities.</p><p>Abilities wither under criticism; they blossom under encouragement.

Be “hearty in yourapprobation and lavish in your praise.”GIVE A DOG A GOOD NAMEWhat do you do when a person who has been a good worker begins to turn in shoddy work? You can fire him or her, but that really doesn’t solve anything. You can berate the worker, but this usually causes resentment.</p><p>Henry Henke, a service manager for a large truck dealership in Lowell, Indiana, had a mechanic whose work had become less than satisfactory. Instead of bawling him out or threatening him, Mr. Henke called him into his office and had a heart-to-heart talk with him.</p><p>“Bill,” he said, “you are a fine mechanic. You have been in this line of work for a good number of years. You have repaired many vehicles to the customers’ satisfaction.</p><p>In fact, we’ve had a number of compliments about the good work you have done. Yet, of late, the time you take to complete each job has been increasing and your work has not been up to your own old standards. Because you have been such an outstanding mechanic in the past, I felt sure you would want to know that I am not happy with this situation, and perhaps jointly we could find some way to correct the problem.”</p><p>Bill responded that he hadn’t realized he had been falling down in his duties and assured his boss that the work he was getting was not out of his range of expertise and he would try to improve in the future.</p><p>Did he do it? You can be sure he did. He once again became a fast and thorough mechanic. With that reputation</p><p>Mr. Henke had given him to live up to, how could he do anything else but turn out work comparable to that which he had done in the past.</p><p>“The average person,” said Samuel Vauclain, then president of the Baldwin Locomotive Works, &quot;can be led readily if you have his or her respect and if you show that you respect that person for some kind of ability.”</p><p>In short, if you want to improve a person in a certain spect, act as though that particular trait were already one of his or her outstanding characteristics. Shakespeare said “Assume a virtue, if you have it not.” And it might be well to assume and state openly that other people have the virtue you want them to develop. Give them a fine reputation to live up to, and they will make prodigious efforts rather than see you disillusioned.</p><p>Georgette Leblanc, in her book Souvenirs, My Life with Maeterlinck, describes the startling transformation of a humble Belgian Cinderella.</p><p>“A servant girl from a neighboring hotel brought my meals,” she wrote. “She was called ‘Marie the Dish washer’ because she had started her career as a scullery assistant. She was a kind of monster, cross-eyed, bandylegged, poor in flesh and spirit.</p><p>“One day, while she was holding my plate of macaroni in her red hand, I said to her point-blank, ‘Marie, you do not know what treasures are within you.’</p><p>“Accustomed to holding back her emotion, Marie waited a few moments, not daring to risk the slightest gesture for fear of a castastrophe. Then she put the dish on the table, sighed and said ingenuously, ‘Madame, I would never have believed it.’ She did not doubt, she did not ask a question. She simply went back to the kitchen and repeated what I had said, and such is the force of faith that no one made fun of her. From that day on, she was even given a certain consideration. But the most curious change of all occurred in the humble Marie herself. Believing she was the tabernacle of unseen marvels, she began taking care of her face and body so carefully that her starved youth seemed to bloom and modestly hide her plainness.</p><p>“Two months later, she announced her coming marriage with the nephew of the chef. ‘I’m going to be a lady,’ she said, and thanked me. A small phrase had changed her entire life.”</p><p>Georgette Leblanc had given “Marie the Dishwasher” a reputation to live up to - and that reputation had transformed her.</p><p>Bill Parker, a sales representative for a food company in Daytona Beach, Florida, was very excited about the new line of products his company was introducing and was upset when the manager of a large independent food market turned down the opportunity to carry it in his store. Bill brooded all day over this rejection and decided to return to the store before he went home that evening and try again.</p><p>“Jack,” he said, “since I left this morning I realized I hadn’t given you the entire picture of our new line, and</p><p>I would appreciate some of your time to tell you about the points I omitted. I have respected the fact that you are always willing to listen and are big enough to change your mind when the facts warrant a change.”</p><p>Could Jack refuse to give him another hearing? Not with that reputation to live up to.</p><p>One morning Dr. Martin Fitzhugh, a dentist in Dublin,</p><p>Ireland, was shocked when one of his patients pointed out to him that the metal cup holder which she was using to rinse her mouth was not very clean. True, the patient drank from the paper cup, not the holder, but it certainly was not professional to use tarnished equipment.</p><p>When the patient left, Dr. Fitzhugh retreated to his private office to write a note to Bridgit, the charwoman, who came twice a week to clean his office. He wrote:</p><p>My dear Bridgit,</p><p>I see you so seldom, I thought I’d take the time to thank you for the fine job of cleaning you’ve been doing. By the way, I thought I’d mention that since two hours, twice a week, is a very limited amount of time, please feel free to work an extra half hour from time to time if you feel you need to do those “once-in-a-while” things like polishing the cup holders and the like. I, of course, will pay you for the extra time.</p><p>“The next day, when I walked into my office,” Dr.</p><p>Fitzhugh reported, &quot;My desk had been polished to a mirror-like finish, as had my chair, which I nearly slid out of. When I went into the treatment room I found the shiniest, cleanest chrome-plated cup holder I had ever seen nestled in its receptacle. I had given my char-woman a fine reputation to live up to, and because of this small gesture she outperformed all her past efforts.</p><p>How much additional time did she spend on this?

In her class this year she would have Tommy T., the school’s most notorious “bad boy.” His third-grade teacher had constantly complained about Tommy to colleagues, the principal and anyone else who would listen. He was not just mischievous; he caused serious discipline problems in the class, picked fights with the boys, teased the girls, was fresh to the teacher, and seemed to get worse as he grew older.</p><p>His only redeeming feature was his ability to learn rapidly and master the-school work easily.</p><p>Mrs. Hopkins decided to face the “Tommy problem” immediately. When she greeted her new students, she made little comments to each of them: “Rose, that’s a pretty dress you are wearing,” “Alicia, I hear you draw beautifully.” When she came to Tommy, she looked him straight in the eyes and said, “Tommy, I understand you are a natural leader. I’m going to depend on you to help me make this class the best class in the fourth grade this year.” She reinforced this over the first few days by complimenting</p><p>Tommy on everything he did and commenting on how this showed what a good student he was.</p><p>With that reputation to live up to, even a nine-year-old couldn’t let her down - and he didn’t.</p><p>If you want to excel in that difficult leadership role of changing the attitude or behavior of others, use . . .</p><p>PRINCIPLE 7Give the other person a fine reputation to liveup to.MAKE THE FAULT SEEMEASY TO CORRECTA bachelor friend of mine, about forty years old, became engaged, and his fiancée persuaded him to take some belated dancing lessons. “The Lord knows I needed dancing lessons,” he confessed as he told me the story,</p><p>“for I danced just as I did when I first started twenty years ago. The first teacher I engaged probably told me the truth. She said I was all wrong; I would just have to forget everything and begin all over again. But that took the heart out of me. I had no incentive to go on. So I quit her.</p><p>“The next teacher may have been lying, but I liked it.</p><p>She said nonchalantly that my dancing was a bit old-fashioned perhaps, but the fundamentals were all right, and she assured me I wouldn’t have any trouble learning a few new steps. The first teacher had discouraged me by emphasizing my mistakes. This new teacher did the opposite. She kept praising the things I did right and minimizing my errors. ‘You have a natural sense of rhythm,’ she assured me. ‘You really are a natural-born dancer.’ Now my common sense tells me that I always have been and always will be a fourth-rate dancer; yet, deep in my heart, I still like to think that maybe she meant it. To be sure, I was paying her to say it; but why bring that up?</p><p>“At any rate, I know I am a better dancer than I would have been if she hadn’t told me I had a natural sense of rhythm. That encouraged me. That gave me hope. That made me want to improve.”</p><p>Tell your child, your spouse, or your employee that he or she is stupid or dumb at a certain thing, has no gift for it, and is doing it all wrong, and you have destroyed almost every incentive to try to improve. But use the opposite technique - be liberal with your encouragement, make the thing seem easy to do, let the other person know that you have faith in his ability to do it, that he has an undeveloped flair for it - and he will practice until the dawn comes in the window in order to excel.</p><p>Lowell Thomas, a superb artist in human relations, used this technique, He gave you confidence, inspired you with courage and faith. For example, I spent a weekend with Mr. and Mrs. Thomas; and on Saturday night,</p><p>I was asked to sit in on a friendly bridge game before a roaring fire. Bridge? Oh, no! No! No! Not me. I knew nothing about it. The game had always been a black mystery to me, No! No! Impossible!</p><p>“Why, Dale, it is no trick at all,” Lowell replied.</p><p>“There is nothing to bridge except memory and judgment.</p><p>You’ve written articles on memory. Bridge will be a cinch for you. It’s right up your alley.”</p><p>And presto, almost before I realized what I was doing,</p><p>I found myself for the first time at a bridge table. All because I was told I had a natural flair for it and the game was made to seem easy.</p><p>Speaking of bridge reminds me of Ely Culbertson, whose books on bridge have been translated into a dozen languages and have sold more than a million copies.</p><p>Yet he told me he never would have made a profession out of the game if a certain young woman hadn’t assured him he had a flair for it.</p><p>When he came to America in 1922, he tried to get a job teaching in philosophy and sociology, but he couldn’t.</p><p>Then he tried selling coal, and he failed at that</p><p>Then he tried selling coffee, and he failed at that, too.</p><p>He had played some bridge, but it had never occurred to him in those days that someday he would teach it. He was not only a poor card player, but he was also very stubborn. He asked so many questions and held so many post-mortem examinations that no one wanted to play with him.</p><p>Then he met a pretty bridge teacher, Josephine Dillon, fell in love and married her. She noticed how carefully he analyzed his cards and persuaded him that he was a potential genius at the card table. It was that encouragement and that alone, Culbertson told me, that caused him to make a profession of bridge.</p><p>Clarence M. Jones, one of the instructors of our course in Cincinnati, Ohio, told how encouragement and making faults seem easy to correct completely changed the life of his son.</p><p>“In 1970 my son David, who was then fifteen years old, came to live with me in Cincinnati. He had led a rough life. In 1958 his head was cut open in a car accident, leaving a very bad scar on his forehead. In 1960 his mother and I were divorced and he moved to Dallas,</p><p>Texas, with his mother. Until he was fifteen he had spent most of his school years in special classes for slow learners in the Dallas school system. Possibly because of the scar, school administrators had decided he was brain-injured and could not function at a normal level. He was two years behind his age group, so he was only in the seventh grade. Yet he did not know his multiplication tables, added on his fingers and could barely read.</p><p>“There was one positive point. He loved to work on radio and TV sets. He wanted to become a TV technician.</p><p>I encouraged this and pointed out that he needed math to qualify for the training. I decided to help him become proficient in this subject. We obtained four sets of flash cards: multiplication, division, addition and subtraction.</p><p>As we went through the cards, we put the correct answers in a discard stack. When David missed one,</p><p>I gave him the correct answer and then put the card in the repeat stack until there were no cards left. I made a big deal out of each card he got right, particularly if he had missed it previously. Each night we would go through the repeat stack until there were no cards left.</p><p>Each night we timed the exercise with a stop watch. I promised him that when he could get all the cards correct in eight minutes with no incorrect answers, we would quit doing it every night. This seemed an impossible goal to David. The first night it took 52 minutes, the second night, 48, then 45, 44, 41 then under 40 minutes.</p><p>We celebrated each reduction. I’d call in my wife, and we would both hug him and we’d all dance a jig. At the end of the month he was doing all the cards perfectly in less than eight minutes. When he made a small improvement he would ask to do it again. He had made the fantastic discovery that learning was easy and fun.</p><p>“Naturally his grades in algebra took a jump. It is amazing how much easier algebra is when you can multiply.</p><p>He astonished himself by bringing home a B in math. That had never happened before. Other changes came with almost unbelievable rapidity. His reading improved rapidly, and he began to use his natural talents in drawing. Later in the school year his science teacher assigned him to develop an exhibit. He chose to develop a highly complex series of models to demonstrate the effect of levers. It required skill not only in drawing and model making but in applied mathematics. The exhibit took first prize in his school’s science fair and was entered in the city competition and won third prize for the entire city of Cincinnati.</p><p>“That did it. Here was a kid who had flunked two grades, who had been told he was ‘brain-damaged,’ who had been called ‘Frankenstein’ by his classmates and told his brains must have leaked out of the cut on his head. Suddenly he discovered he could really learn and accomplish things. The result? From the last quarter of the eighth grade all the way through high school, he never failed to make the honor roll; in high school he was elected to the national honor society. Once he found learning was easy, his whole life changed.”</p><p>If you want to help others to improve, remember . . .</p><p>PRINCIPLE 8Use encouragement. Make the fault seemeasy to correct.</p><p>MAKING PEOPLE GLAD TO DOWHAT YOU WANTBack in 1915, America was aghast. For more than a year, the nations of Europe had been slaughtering one another on a scale never before dreamed of in all the bloody annals of mankind. Could peace be brought about? No one knew. But Woodrow Wilson was determined to try. He would send a personal representative, a peace emissary, to counsel with the warlords of Europe.</p><p>William Jennings Bryan, secretary of state, Bryan, the peace advocate, longed to go. He saw a chance to perform a great service and make his name immortal. But</p><p>Wilson appointed another man, his intimate friend and advisor Colonel Edward M. House; and it was House’s thorny task to break the unwelcome news to Bryan without giving him offense.</p><p>“Bryan was distinctly disappointed when he heard I was to go to Europe as the peace emissary,” Colonel</p><p>House records in his diary. “He said he had planned to do this himself . . .</p><p>&quot;I replied that the President thought it would be unwise for anyone to do this officially, and that his going would attract a great deal of attention and people would wonder why he was there. . . .&quot;</p><p>You see the intimation? House practically told Bryan that he was too important for the job - and Bryan was satisfied.</p><p>Colonel House, adroit, experienced in the ways of the world, was following one of the important rules of human relations: Always make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.</p><p>Woodrow Wilson followed that policy even when inviting</p><p>William Gibbs McAdoo to become a member of his cabinet. That was the highest honor he could confer upon anyone, and yet Wilson extended the invitation in such a way as to make McAdoo feel doubly important.</p><p>Here is the story in McAdoo&#x27;s own words: “He <!-- -->[Wilson]<!-- --> said that he was making up his cabinet and that he would be very glad if I would accept a place in it as Secretary of the Treasury. He had a delightful way of putting things; he created the impression that by accepting this great honor I would be doing him a favor.”</p><p>Unfortunately, Wilson didn’t always employ such taut.</p><p>If he had, history might have been different. For example,</p><p>Wilson didn’t make the Senate and the Republican</p><p>Party happy by entering the United States in the League of Nations. Wilson refused to take such prominent Republican leaders as Elihu Root or Charles Evans Hughes or Henry Cabot Lodge to the peace conference with him. Instead, he took along unknown men from his own party. He snubbed the Republicans, refused to let them feel that the League was their idea as well as his, refused to let them have a finger in the pie; and, as a result of this crude handling of human relations, wrecked his own career, ruined his health, shortened his life, caused</p><p>America to stay out of the League, and altered the history of the world.</p><p>Statesmen and diplomats aren’t the only ones who use this make-a-person-happy-yo-do-things-you-want-them-to- do approach. Dale O. Ferrier of Fort Wayne, Indiana, told how he encouraged one of his young children to willingly do the chore he was assigned.</p><p>“One of Jeff’s chores was to pick up pears from under the pear tree so the person who was mowing underneath wouldn’t have to stop to pick them up. He didn’t like this chore, and frequently it was either not done at all or it was done so poorly that the mower had to stop and pick up several pears that he had missed. Rather than have an eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation about it, one day I said to him: ‘Jeff, I’ll make a deal with you. For every bushel basket full of pears you pick up, I’ll pay you one dollar. But after you are finished, for every pear</p><p>I find left in the yard, I’ll take away a dollar. How does that sound?’ As you would expect, he not only picked up all of the pears, but I had to keep an eye on him to see that he didn’t pull a few off the trees to fill up some of the baskets.”</p><p>I knew a man who had to refuse many invitations to speak, invitations extended by friends, invitations coming from people to whom he was obligated; and yet he did it so adroitly that the other person was at least contented with his refusal. How did he do it? Not by merely talking about the fact that he was too busy and too-this and too-that. No, after expressing his appreciation of the invitation and regretting his inability to accept it, he suggested a substitute speaker. In other words, he didn’t give the other person any time to feel unhappy about the refusal, He immediately changed the other person’s thoughts to some other speaker who could accept the invitation.</p><p>Gunter Schmidt, who took our course in West Germany, told of an employee in the food store he managed who was negligent about putting the proper price tags on the shelves where the items were displayed. This caused confusion and customer complaints. Reminders, admonitions, confrontations, with her about this did not do much good. Finally, Mr. Schmidt called her into his office and told her he was appointing her Supervisor of</p><p>Price Tag Posting for the entire store and she would be responsible for keeping all of the shelves properly tagged. This new responsibility and title changed her attitude completely, and she fulfiled her duties satisfactorily from then on.</p><p>Childish? Perhaps. But that is what they said to Napoleon when he created the Legion of Honor and distributed</p><p>15,000 crosses to his soldiers and made eighteen of his generals “Marshals of France” and called his troops the “Grand Army.” Napoleon was criticized for giving “toys” to war-hardened veterans, and Napoleon replied, “Men are ruled by toys.”</p><p>This technique of giving titles and authority worked for Napoleon and it will work for you. For example, a friend of mine, Mrs. Ernest Gent of Scarsdale, New</p><p>York, was troubled by boys running across and destroying her lawn. She tried criticism. She tried coaxing. Neither worked. Then she tried giving the worst sinner in the gang a title and a feeling of authority. She made him her “detective” and put him in charge of keeping all trespassers off her lawn. That solved her problem. Her</p><p>“detective” built a bonfire in the backyard, heated an iron red hot, and threatened to brand any boy who stepped on the lawn.</p><p>The effective leader should keep the following guidelines in mind when it is necessary to change attitudes or behavior:</p><ol><li><p>Be sincere. Do not promise anything that you cannot deliver. Forget about the benefits to yourself and concentrate on the benefits to the other person.</p></li><li><p>Know exactly what it is you want the other person to do.</p></li><li><p>Be empathetic. Ask yourself what is it the other person really wants.</p></li><li><p>Consider the benefits that person will receive from doing what you suggest.</p></li><li><p>Match those benefits to the other person’s wants.</p></li><li><p>When you make your request, put it in a form that will convey to the other person the idea that he personally will benefit. We could give a curt order like this: &quot; John, we have customers coming in tomorrow and I need the stockroom cleaned out. So sweep it out, put the stock in neat piles on the shelves and polish the counter.” Or we could express the same idea by showing John the benefits he will get from doing the task: “John, we have a job that should be completed right away. If it is done now, we won’t be faced with it later. I am bringing some customers in tomorrow to show our facilities. I would like to show them the stockroom, but it is in poor shape. If you could sweep it out, put the stock in neat piles on the shelves, and polish the counter, it would make us look efficient and you will have done your part to provide a good company image.”</p></li></ol><p>Will John be happy about doing what you suggest?</p><p>Probably not very happy, but happier than if you had not pointed out the benefits. Assuming you know that John has pride in the way his stockroom looks and is interested in contributing to the company image, he will be more likely to be cooperative. It also will have been pointed out to John that the job would have to be done eventually and by doing it now, he won’t be faced with it later.</p><p>It is naïve to believe you will always get a favorable reaction from other persons when you use these approaches, but the experience of most people shows that you are more likely to change attitudes this way than by not using these principles - and if you increase your successes by even a mere 10 percent, you have become 10 percent more effective as a leader than you were before</p><ul><li>and that is your benefit.</li></ul><p>People are more likely to do what you would like them to do when you use . . .</p><p>PRINCIPLE 9Make the other person happy about doingthe thing you suggest.</p><p>In a NutshellBE A LEADER</p><p>A leader’s job often includes changing your people’s attitudes and behavior. Some suggestions to accomplish this:</p><p>PRINCIPLE 1</p><p>Begin with praise and honest appreciation.</p><p>PRINCIPLE 2</p><p>Call attention to people’s mistakes indirectly.</p><p>PRINCIPLE 3</p><p>Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person.</p><p>PRINCIPLE 4</p><p>Ask questions instead of giving direct orders.</p><p>PRINCIPLE 5</p><p>Let the other person save face.</p><p>PRINCIPLE 6</p><p>Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement. Be “hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.”</p><p>PRINCIPLE 7</p><p>Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to.</p><p>PRINCIPLE 8</p><p>Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct.</p><p>PRINCIPLE 9</p><p>Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.</p><p>A Shortcut to</p><p>Distinction by Lowell ThomasThis biographical information about Dale Carnegie was written as an introduction to the original edition of</p><p>How to Win Friends and Influence People. It is reprinted in this edition to give the readers additional background on Dale Carnegie.</p><p>It was a cold January night in 1935, but the weather couldn’t keep them away. Two thousand five hundred men and women thronged into the grand ballroom of the</p><p>Hotel Pennsylvania in New York. Every available seat was filled by half-past seven. At eight o’clock, the eager crowd was still pouring in. The spacious balcony was soon jammed. Presently even standing space was at a premium, and hundreds of people, tired after navigating a day in business, stood up for an hour and a half that night to witness - what?</p><p>A fashion show?</p><p>A six-day bicycle race or a personal appearance by</p><p>Clark Gable?</p><p>No. These people had been lured there by a newspaper ad. Two evenings previously, they had seen this full-page announcement in the New York Sunstaring them in the face:</p><p>Learn to Speak Effectively</p><p>Prepare for Leadership</p><p>Old stuff? Yes, but believe it or not, in the most sophisticated town on earth, during a depression with 20 percent of the population on relief, twenty-five hundred people had left their homes and hustled to the hotel in response to that ad.</p><p>The people who responded were of the upper economic strata - executives, employers and professionals.</p><p>These men and women had come to hear the opening gun of an ultramodern, ultrapractical course in “Effective</p><p>Speaking and Influencing Men in Business”- a course given by the Dale Carnegie Institute of Effective</p><p>Speaking and Human Relations.</p><p>Why were they there, these twenty-five hundred business men and women?</p><p>Because of a sudden hunger for more education because of the depression?</p><p>Apparently not, for this same course had been playing to packed houses in New York City every season for the preceding twenty-four years. During that time, more than fifteen thousand business and professional people had been trained by Dale Carnegie. Even large, skeptical, conservative organizations such as the Westinghouse</p><p>Electric Company, the McGraw-Hill Publishing</p><p>Company, the Brooklyn Union Gas Company, the</p><p>Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, the American Institute of Electrical Engineers and the New York Telephone</p><p>Company have had this training conducted in their own offices for the benefit of their members and executives.</p><p>The fact that these people, ten or twenty years after leaving grade school, high school or college, come and take this training is a glaring commentary on the shocking deficiencies of our educational system.</p><p>What do adults really want to study?That is an important question; and in order to answer it, the University of Chicago, the American Association for Adult Education, and the United Y.M.C.A. Schools made a survey over a two-year period.</p><p>That survey revealed that the prime interest of adults is health. It also revealed that their second interest is in developing skill in human relationships - they want to learn the technique of getting along with and influencing other people. They don’t want to become public speakers, and they don’t want to listen to a lot of high sounding talk about psychology; they want suggestions they can use immediately in business, in social contacts and in the home.</p><p>So that was what adults wanted to study, was it?</p><p>“All right,” said the people making the survey. &quot;Fine.</p><p>If that is what they want, we’ll give it to them.”</p><p>Looking around for a textbook, they discovered that no working manual had ever been written to help people solve their daily problems in human relationships.</p><p>Here was a fine kettle of fish! For hundreds of years, learned volumes had been written on Greek and Latin and higher mathematics - topics about which the average adult doesn’t give two hoots. But on the one subject on which he has a thirst for knowledge, a veritable passion for guidance and help - nothing!</p><p>This explained the presence of twenty-five hundred eager adults crowding into the grand ballroom of the</p><p>Hotel Pennsylvania in response to a newspaper advertisement.</p><p>Here, apparently, at last was the thing for which they had long been seeking.</p><p>Back in high school and college, they had pored over books, believing that knowledge alone was the open sesame to financial - and professional rewards.</p><p>But a few years in the rough-and-tumble of business and professional life had brought sharp dissillusionment.</p><p>They had seen some of the most important business successes won by men who possessed, in addition to their knowledge, the ability to talk well, to win people to their way of thinking, and to &quot;sell&quot; themselves and their ideas.</p><p>They soon discovered that if one aspired to wear the captain’s cap and navigate the ship of business, personality and the ability to talk are more important than a knowledge of Latin verbs or a sheepskin from Harvard.</p><p>The advertisement in the New York Sun promised that the meeting would be highly entertaining. It was.</p><p>Eighteen people who had taken the course were marshaled in front of the loudspeaker - and fifteen of them were given precisely seventy-five seconds each to tell his or her story. Only seventy-five seconds of talk, then</p><p>“bang” went the gavel, and the chairman shouted,</p><p>“Time! Next speaker!”</p><p>The affair moved with the speed of a herd of buffalo thundering across the plains. Spectators stood for an hour and a half to watch the performance.</p><p>The speakers were a cross section of life: several sales representatives, a chain store executive, a baker, the president of a trade association, two bankers, an insurance agent, an accountant, a dentist, an architect, a druggist who had come from Indianapolis to New York to take the course, a lawyer who had come from Havana in order to prepare himself to give one important three-minute speech.</p><p>The first speaker bore the Gaelic name Patrick J.</p><p>O&#x27;Haire. Born in Ireland, he attended school for only four years, drifted to America, worked as a mechanic, then as a chauffeur.</p><p>Now, however, he was forty, he had a growing family and needed more money, so he tried selling trucks. Suffering from an inferiority complex that, as he put it, was eating his heart out, he had to walk up and down in front of an office half a dozen times before he could summon up enough courage to open the door. He was so discouraged as a salesman that he was thinking of going back to working with his hands in a machine shop, when one day he received a letter inviting him to an organization meeting of the Dale Carnegie Course in Effective</p><p>Speaking.</p><p>He didn’t want to attend. He feared he would have to associate with a lot of college graduates, that he would be out of place.</p><p>His despairing wife insisted that he go, saying, “It may do you some good, Pat. God knows you need it.”</p><p>He went down to the place where the meeting was to be held and stood on the sidewalk for five minutes before he could generate enough self-confidence to enter the room.</p><p>The first few times he tried to speak in front of the others, he was dizzy with fear. But as the weeks drifted by, he lost all fear of audiences and soon found that he loved to talk - the bigger the crowd, the better. And he also lost his fear of individuals and of his superiors. He presented his ideas to them, and soon he had been advanced into the sales department. He had become a valued and much liked member of his company. This night, in the Hotel Pennsylvania, Patrick O&#x27;Haire stood in front of twenty-five hundred people and told a gay, rollicking story of his achievements. Wave after wave of laughter swept over the audience. Few professional speakers could have equaled his performance.</p><p>The next speaker, Godfrey Meyer, was a gray-headed banker, the father of eleven children. The first time he had attempted to speak in class, he was literally struck dumb. His mind refused to function. His story is a vivid illustration of how leadership gravitates to the person who can talk.</p><p>He worked on Wall Street, and for twenty-five years he had been living in Clifton, New Jersey. During that time, he had taken no active part in community affairs and knew perhaps five hundred people.</p><p>Shortly after he had enrolled in the Carnegie course, he received his tax bill and was infuriated by what he considered unjust charges. Ordinarily, he would have sat at home and fumed, or he would have taken it out in grousing to his neighbors. But instead, he put on his hat that night, walked into the town meeting, and blew off steam in public.</p><p>As a result of that talk of indignation, the citizens of</p><p>Clifton, New Jersey, urged him to run for the town council.</p><p>So for weeks he went from one meeting to another, denouncing waste and municipal extravagance.</p><p>There were ninety-six candidates in the field. When the ballots were counted, lo, Godfrey Meyer’s name led all the rest. Almost overnight, he had become a public figure among the forty thousand people in his community.</p><p>As a result of his talks, he made eighty times more friends in six weeks than he had been able to previously in twenty-five years.</p><p>And his salary as councilman meant that he got a return of 1,000 percent a year on his investment in the</p><p>Carnegie course.</p><p>The third speaker, the head of a large national association of food manufacturers, told how he had been unable to stand up and express his ideas at meetings of a board of directors.</p><p>As a result of learning to think on his feet, two astonishing things happened. He was soon made president of his association, and in that capacity, he was obliged to address meetings all over the United States. Excerpts from his talks were put on the Associated Press wires and printed in newspapers and trade magazines throughout the country.</p><p>In two years, after learning to speak more effectively, he received more free publicity for his company and its products than he had been able to get previously with a quarter of a million dollars spent in direct advertising.</p><p>This speaker admitted that he had formerly hesitated to telephone some of the more important business executives in Manhattan and invite them to lunch with him.</p><p>But as a result of the prestige he had acquired by his talks, these same people telephoned him and invited him to lunch and apologized to him for encroaching on his time.</p><p>The ability to speak is a shortcut to distinction. It puts a person in the limelight, raises one head and shoulders above the crowd. And the person who can speak acceptably is usually given credit for an ability out of all proportion to what he or she really possesses.</p><p>A movement for adult education has been sweeping over the nation; and the most spectacular force in that movement was Dale Carnegie, a man who listened to and critiqued more talks by adults than has any other man in captivity. According to a cartoon by &quot;Believe-It-or-</p><p>Not” Ripley, he had criticized 150,000 speeches. If that grand total doesn’t impress you, remember that it meant one talk for almost every day that has passed since</p><p>Columbus discovered America. Or, to put it in other words, if all the people who had spoken before him had used only three minutes and had appeared before him in succession, it would have taken ten months, listening day and night, to hear them all.</p><p>Dale Carnegie’s own career, filled with sharp contrasts, was a striking example of what a person can accomplish when obsessed with an original idea and afire with enthusiasm.</p><p>Born on a Missouri farm ten miles from a railway, he never saw a streetcar until he was twelve years old; yet by the time he was forty-six, he was familiar with the far-flung corners of the earth, everywhere from Hong Kong to Hammerfest; and, at one time, he approached closer to the North Pole than Admiral Byrd’s headquarters at</p><p>Little America was to the South Pole.</p><p>This Missouri lad who had once picked strawberries and cut cockleburs for five cents an hour became the highly paid trainer of the executives of large corporations in the art of self-expression.</p><p>This erstwhile cowboy who had once punched cattle and branded calves and ridden fences out in western</p><p>South Dakota later went to London to put on shows under the patronage of the royal family.</p><p>This chap who was a total failure the first half-dozen times he tried to speak in public later became my personal manager. Much of my success has been due to training under Dale Carnegie.</p><p>Young Carnegie had to struggle for an education, for hard luck was always battering away at the old farm in northwest Missouri with a flying tackle and a body slam.</p><p>Year after year, the “102” River rose and drowned the corn and swept away the hay. Season after season, the fat hogs sickened and died from cholera, the bottom fell out of the market for cattle and mules, and the bank threatened to foreclose the mortgage.</p><p>Sick with discouragement, the family sold out and bought another farm near the State Teachers’ College at</p><p>Warrensburg, Missouri. Board and room could be had in town for a dollar a day, but young Carnegie couldn’t afford it. So he stayed on the farm and commuted on horseback three miles to college each day. At home, he milked the cows, cut the wood, fed the hogs, and studied his Latin verbs by the light of a coal-oil lamp until his eyes blurred and he began to nod.</p><p>Even when he got to bed at midnight, he set the alarm for three o’clock. His father bred pedigreed Duroc-Jersey hogs - and there was danger, during the bitter cold nights, that the young pigs would freeze to death; so they were put in a basket, covered with a gunny sack, and set behind the kitchen stove. True to their nature, the pigs demanded a hot meal at 3 A.M. So when the alarm went off, Dale Carnegie crawled out of the blankets, took the basket of pigs out to their mother, waited for them to nurse, and then brought them back to the warmth of the kitchen stove.</p><p>There were six hundred students in State Teachers’</p><p>College, and Dale Carnegie was one of the isolated half-dozen who couldn’t afford to board in town. He was ashamed of the poverty that made it necessary for him to ride back to the farm and milk the cows every night. He was ashamed of his coat, which was too tight, and his trousers, which were too short. Rapidly developing an inferiority complex, he looked about for some shortcut to distinction. He soon saw that there were certain groups in college that enjoyed influence and prestige - the football and baseball players and the chaps who won the debating and public-speaking contests.</p><p>Realizing that he had no flair for athletics, he decided to win one of the speaking contests. He spent months preparing his talks. He practiced as he sat in the saddle galloping to college and back; he practiced his speeches as he milked the cows; and then he mounted a bale of hay in the barn and with great gusto and gestures harangued the frightened pigeons about the issues of the day.</p><p>But in spite of all his earnestness and preparation, he met with defeat after defeat. He was eighteen at the time</p><ul><li>sensitive and proud. He became so discouraged, so depressed, that he even thought of suicide. And then suddenly he began to win, not one contest, but every speaking contest in college.</li></ul><p>Other students pleaded with him to train them; and they won also.</p><p>After graduating from college, he started selling  correspondence courses to the ranchers among the sand hills of western Nebraska and eastern Wyoming. In spite of all his boundless energy and enthusiasm, he couldn’t make the grade. He became so discouraged that he went to his hotel room in Alliance, Nebraska, in the middle of the day, threw himself across the bed, and wept in despair.</p><p>He longed to go back to college, he longed to retreat from the harsh battle of life; but he couldn’t. So he resolved to go to Omaha and get another job. He didn’t have the money for a railroad ticket, so he traveled on a freight train, feeding and watering two carloads of wild horses in return for his passage, After landing in south Omaha, he got a job selling bacon and soap and lard for Armour and Company. His territory was up among the Badlands and the cow and Indian country of western South Dakota. He covered his territory by freight train and stage coach and horseback and slept in pioneer hotels where the only partition between the rooms was a sheet of muslin. He studied books on salesmanship, rode bucking bronchos, played poker with the</p><p>Indians, and learned how to collect money. And when, for example, an inland storekeeper couldn’t pay cash for the bacon and hams he had ordered, Dale Carnegie would take a dozen pairs of shoes off his shelf, sell the shoes to the railroad men, and forward the receipts to</p><p>Armour and Company.</p><p>He would often ride a freight train a hundred miles a day. When the train stopped to unload freight, he would dash uptown, see three or four merchants, get his orders; and when the whistle blew, he would dash down the street again lickety-split and swing onto the train while it was moving.</p><p>Within two years, he had taken an unproductive territory that had stood in the twenty-fifth place and had boosted it to first place among all the twenty-nine car routes leading out of south Omaha. Armour and Company offered to promote him, saying: “You have achieved what seemed impossible.” But he refused the promotion and resigned, went to New York, studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, and toured the country, playing the role of Dr. Hartley in Polly of the</p><p>Circus.</p><p>He would never be a Booth or a Barrymore. He had the good sense to recognize that, So back he went to sales work, selling automobiles and trucks for the Packard</p><p>Motor Car Company.</p><p>He knew nothing about machinery and cared nothing about it. Dreadfully unhappy, he had to scourge himself to his task each day. He longed to have time to study, to write the books he had dreamed about writing back in college. So he resigned. He was going to spend his days writing stories and novels and support himself by teaching in a night school.</p><p>Teaching what? As he looked back and evaluated his college work, he saw that his training in public speaking had done more to give him confidence, courage, poise and the ability to meet and deal with people in business than had all the rest of his college courses put together,</p><p>So he urged the Y.M.C.A. schools in New York to give him a chance to conduct courses in public speaking for people in business.</p><p>What? Make orators out of business people? Absurd.</p><p>The Y.M.C.A. people knew. They had tried such courses</p><p>-and they had always failed. When they refused to pay him a salary of two dollars a night, he agreed to teach on a commission basis and take a percentage of the net profits</p><p>-if there were any profits to take. And inside of three years they were paying him thirty dollars a night on that basis - instead of two.</p><p>The course grew. Other &quot;Ys&quot; heard of it, then other cities. Dale Carnegie soon became a glorified circuit rider covering New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and later London and Paris. All the textbooks were too academic and impractical for the business people who flocked to his courses. Because of this he wrote his own book entitled Public Speaking and Influencing Men in</p><p>Business. It became the official text of all the Y.M.C.A.s as well as of the American Bankers’ Association and the</p><p>National Credit Men’s Association.</p><p>Dale Carnegie claimed that all people can talk when they get mad. He said that if you hit the most ignorant man in town on the jaw and knock him down, he would get on his feet and talk with an eloquence, heat and emphasis that would have rivaled that world famous orator</p><p>William Jennings Bryan at the height of his career.</p><p>He claimed that almost any person can speak acceptably in public if he or she has self-confidence and an idea that is boiling and stewing within.</p><p>The way to develop self-confidence, he said, is to do the thing you fear to do and get a record of successful experiences behind you. So he forced each class member to talk at every session of the course. The audience is sympathetic. They are all in the same boat; and, by constant practice, they develop a courage, confidence and enthusiasm that carry over into their private speaking.</p><p>Dale Carnegie would tell you that he made a living all these years, not by teaching public speaking - that was incidental. His main job was to help people conquer their fears and develop courage.</p><p>He started out at first to conduct merely a course in public speaking, but the students who came were business men and women. Many of them hadn’t seen the inside of a classroom in thirty years. Most of them were paying their tuition on the installment plan. They wanted results and they wanted them quick - results that they could use the next day in business interviews and in speaking before groups.</p><p>So he was forced to be swift and practical. Consequently, he developed a system of training that is unique - a striking combination of public speaking, salesmanship, human relations and applied psychology.</p><p>A slave to no hard-and-fast rules, he developed a course that is as real as the measles and twice as much fun.</p><p>When the classes terminated, the graduates formed clubs of their own and continued to meet fortnightly for years afterward. One group of nineteen in Philadelphia met twice a month during the winter season for seventeen years. Class members frequently travel fifty or a hundred miles to attend classes. One student used to commute each week from Chicago to New York.</p><p>Professor William James of Harvard used to say that the average person develops only 10 percent of his latent mental ability. Dale Carnegie, by helping business men and women to develop their latent possibilities, created one of the most significant movements in adult education</p><p>LOWELL THOMAS</p><p>1936</p><p>THE DALE CARNEGIE COURSES</p><p>THE DALE CARNEGIE COURSE IN</p><p>EFFECTIVE SPEAKING AND HUMAN RELATIONS</p><p>Probably the most popular program ever offered in developing better interpersonal relations, this course is designed to develop self-confidence, the ability to get along with others in one’s family and in social and occupational relations, to increase ability to communicate ideas, to build positive attitudes, increase enthusiasm, reduce tension and anxiety and to increase one’s enjoyment of life. Not only do many thousands of individuals enroll in this course each year, but it has been used by companies, government agencies and other organizations to develop the potential of their people.</p><p>THE DALE CARNEGIE SALES COURSE</p><p>This in-depth participative program is designed to help persons currently engaged in sales or sales management to become more professional and successful in their careers. It covers the vital but little understood element of customer motivation and its application to any product or service that is being sold. Salespeople are put on the firing line of actual sales situations and learn to use motivational selling methods.</p><p>THE DALE CARNEGIE MANAGEMENT SEMINAR</p><p>This program sets forth the Dale Carnegie principles of human relations and applies them to business. The importance of balancing results attained with the development of people-potential to assure long-term growth and profit is highlighted.</p><p>Participants construct their own position descriptions and learn how to stimulate creativity in their people, motivate, delegate and communicate, as well as solve problems and make decisions in a systematic manner. Application of these principles to each person’s own job is emphasized.</p><p>If you are interested in any of these courses, details on when and where they are offered in your community can be obtained by writing to:</p><p>Dale Carnegie &amp; Associates, Inc.</p><p>1475 Franklin Ave.</p><p>Garden City, N.Y. 11530</p><p>OTHER BOOKS</p><p>How to Stop Worrying &amp; Start Living by Dale Carnegie</p><p>A practical, concrete, easy-to-read, inspiring handbook on conquering work and fears.</p><p>Simon &amp; Schuster, 1230 Ave. of the Americas, N.Y.C</p><p>10020</p><p>Lincoln the Unknown by Dale Carnegie</p><p>A fascinating story of little-known facts and insights about this great American.</p><p>Dale Carnegie &amp; Associates, Inc., 1475 Franklin Ave.,</p><p>Garden City, N.Y. 11530</p><p>The Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking by Dorothy</p><p>Carnegie</p><p>Principles and practical implementation of expressing one-self before groups of people.</p><p>Dale Carnegie &amp; Associates, Inc., 1475 Franklin Ave.,</p><p>Garden City, N.Y. 11530</p><p>The Dale Carnegie Scrapbook edited by Dorothy Carnegie</p><p>A collection of quotations that Dale Carnegie found inspirational interspersed with nuggets from his own writings.</p><p>Simon &amp; Schuster, 1230 Ave. of the Americas, N.Y.C.</p><p>10020</p><p>Don’t Grow Old-Grow Up by Dorothy Carnegie</p><p>How to stay young in spirit as you grow older.</p><p>Dale Carnegie &amp; Associates, Inc., 1475 Franklin Ave.,</p><p>Garden City, N.Y. 11530</p><p>Managing Through People by Dale Carnegie &amp; Associates,</p><p>Inc</p><p>The application of Dale Carnegie’s principles of good human relations to effective management.</p><p>Simon &amp; Schuster, 1230 Ave. of the Americas, N.Y.C.</p><p>10020</p><p>Enrich Your Life, The Dale Carnegie Way by Arthur R.

To their amazement, the book became an overnight sensation, and edition after edition rolled off the presses to keep up with the increasing public demand. Now to Win</p><p>Friends and InfEuence People took its place in publishing history as one of the all-time international best-sellers.</p><p>It touched a nerve and filled a human need that was more than a faddish phenomenon of post-Depression days, as evidenced by its continued and uninterrupted sales into the eighties, almost half a century later.</p><p>Dale Carnegie used to say that it was easier to make a million dollars than to put a phrase into the English language.</p><p>How to Win Friends and Influence People became such a phrase, quoted, paraphrased, parodied, used in innumerable contexts from political cartoon to novels. The book itself was translated into almost every known written language. Each generation has discovered it anew and has found it relevant.</p><p>Which brings us to the logical question: Why revise a book that has proven and continues to prove its vigorous  and universal appeal? Why tamper with success?</p><p>To answer that, we must realize that Dale Carnegie himself was a tireless reviser of his own work during his lifetime. How to Win Friends and Influence People was written to be used as a textbook for his courses in Effective</p><p>Speaking and Human Relations and is still used in those courses today. Until his death in 1955 he constantly improved and revised the course itself to make it applicable to the evolving needs of an every-growing public. No one was more sensitive to the changing currents of present-day life than Dale Carnegie. He constantly improved and refined his methods of teaching; he updated his book on Effective Speaking several times. Had he lived longer, he himself would have revised</p><p>How to Win Friends and Influence People to better reflect the changes that have taken place in the world since the thirties.</p><p>Many of the names of prominent people in the book, well known at the time of first publication, are no longer recognized by many of today’s readers. Certain examples and phrases seem as quaint and dated in our social climate as those in a Victorian novel. The important message and overall impact of the book is weakened to that extent.</p><p>Our purpose, therefore, in this revision is to clarify and strengthen the book for a modern reader without tampering with the content. We have not “changed”</p><p>Howto Win Friends and Influence People except to make a few excisions and add a few more contemporary examples. The brash, breezy Carnegie style is intact-even the thirties slang is still there. Dale Carnegie wrote as he spoke, in an intensively exuberant, colloquial,  conversational manner.</p><p>So his voice still speaks as forcefully as ever, in the book and in his work. Thousands of people all over the world are being trained in Carnegie courses in increasing numbers each year. And other thousands are reading and studying How to Win Friends and lnfluence People and being inspired to use its principles to better their lives. To all of them, we offer this revision in the spirit of the honing and polishing of a finely made tool.</p><p>Dorothy Carnegie</p><p>(Mrs. Dale Carnegie)</p><p>How This Book Was</p><p>Written-And Why</p><p>Dale Carnegie</p><p>During the first thirty-five years of the twentieth century, the publishing houses of America printed more than a fifth of a million different books. Most of them were deadly dull, and many were financial failures.</p><p>“Many,” did I say? The president of one of the largest publishing houses in the world confessed to me that his company, after seventy-five years of publishing experience, still lost money on seven out of every eight books it published.</p><p>Why, then, did I have the temerity to write another book? And, after I had written it, why should you bother to read it?</p><p>Fair questions, both; and I&#x27;ll try to answer them.</p><p>I have, since 1912, been conducting educational courses for business and professional men and women in New York. At first, I conducted courses in public speaking only - courses designed to train adults, by actual experience, to think on their feet and express their ideas with more clarity, more effectiveness and more poise, both in business interviews and before groups.</p><p>But gradually, as the seasons passed, I realized that as sorely as these adults needed training in effective speaking, they needed still more training in the fine art of getting along with people in everyday business and social contacts.</p><p>I also gradually realized that I was sorely in need of such training myself. As I look back across the years, I am appalled at my own frequent lack of finesse and  understanding. How I wish a book such as this had been placed in my hands twenty years ago! What a priceless boon it would have been.</p><p>Dealing with people is probably the biggest problem you face, especially if you are in business. Yes, and that is also true if you are a housewife, architect or engineer.</p><p>Research done a few years ago under the auspices of the</p><p>Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching uncovered a most important and significant fact - a fact later confirmed by additional studies made at the Carnegie</p><p>Institute of Technology. These investigations revealed that even in such technical lines as engineering, about 15 percent of one&#x27;s financial success is due to one’s technical knowledge and about 85 percent is due to skill in human engineering-to personality and the ability to lead people.</p><p>For many years, I conducted courses each season at the Engineers’ Club of Philadelphia, and also courses for the New York Chapter of the American Institute of</p><p>Electrical Engineers. A total of probably more than fifteen hundred engineers have passed through my classes. They came to me because they had finally realized, after years of observation and experience, that the highest-paid personnel in engineering are frequently not those who know the most about engineering. One can for example, hire mere technical ability in engineering, accountancy, architecture or any other profession at nominal salaries. But the person who has technical knowledge plus the ability to express ideas, to assume leadership, and to arouse enthusiasm among people-that person is headed for higher earning power.</p><p>In the heyday of his activity, John D. Rockefeller said that “the ability to deal with people is as purchasable a commodity as sugar or coffee.” “And I will pay more for that ability,” said John D., “than for any other under the sun.”</p><p>Wouldn’t you suppose that every college in the land would conduct courses to develop the highest-priced ability under the sun? But if there is just one practical, common-sense course of that kind given for adults in even one college in the land, it has escaped my attention up to the present writing.</p><p>The University of Chicago and the United Y.M.C.A.</p><p>Schools conducted a survey to determine what adults want to study.</p><p>That survey cost $25,000 and took two years. The last part of the survey was made in Meriden, Connecticut. It had been chosen as a typical American town. Every adult in Meriden was interviewed and requested to answer</p><p>156 questions-questions such as “What is your business or profession? Your education? How do you spend your spare time? What is your income? Your hobbies?</p><p>Your ambitions? Your problems? What subjects are you most interested in studying?” And so on. That survey revealed that health is the prime interest of adults and that their second interest is people; how to understand and get along with people; how to make people like you; and how to win others to your way of thinking.</p><p>So the committee conducting this survey resolved to conduct such a course for adults in Meriden. They searched diligently for a practical textbook on the subject and found-not one. Finally they approached one of the world’s outstanding authorities on adult education and asked him if he knew of any book that met the needs of this group. “No,” he replied, &quot;I know what those adults want. But the book they need has never been written.”</p><p>I knew from experience that this statement was true, for I myself had been searching for years to discover a practical, working handbook on human relations.</p><p>Since no such book existed, I have tried to write one for use in my own courses. And here it is. I hope you like it.</p><p>In preparation for this book, I read everything that I could find on the subject- everything from newspaper columns, magazine articles, records of the family courts, the writings of the old philosophers and the new  psychologists. In addition, I hired a trained researcher to spend one and a half years in various libraries reading everything I had missed, plowing through erudite tomes on psychology, poring over hundreds of magazine articles, searching through countless biographies, trying to ascertain how the great leaders of all ages had dealt with people. We read their biographies, We read the life stories of all great leaders from Julius Caesar to Thomas Edison.</p><p>I recall that we read over one hundred biographies of Theodore Roosevelt alone. We were determined to spare no time, no expense, to discover every practical idea that anyone had ever used throughout the ages for winning friends and influencing people.</p><p>I personally interviewed scores of successful people, some of them world-famous-inventors like Marconi and Edison; political leaders like Franklin D. Roosevelt and James Farley; business leaders like Owen D.</p><p>Young; movie stars like Clark Gable and Mary Pickford; and explorers like Martin Johnson-and tried to discover the techniques they used in human relations.</p><p>From all this material, I prepared a short talk. I called it “How to Win Friends and Influence People.” I say</p><p>“short.” It was short in the beginning, but it soon  expanded to a lecture that consumed one hour and thirty minutes. For years, I gave this talk each season to the adults in the Carnegie Institute courses in New York.</p><p>I gave the talk and urged the listeners to go out and test it in their business and social contacts, and then come back to class and speak about their experiences and the results they had achieved. What an interesting assignment! These men and women, hungry for self- improvement, were fascinated by the idea of working in a new kind of laboratory - the first and only laboratory of human relationships for adults that had ever existed.</p><p>This book wasn’t written in the usual sense of the word. It grew as a child grows. It grew and developed out of that laboratory, out of the experiences of thousands of adults.</p><p>Years ago, we started with a set of rules printed on a card no larger than a postcard. The next season we printed a larger card, then a leaflet, then a series of booklets, each one expanding in size and scope. After fifteen years of experiment and research came this book.</p><p>The rules we have set down here are not mere theories or guesswork. They work like magic. Incredible as it sounds, I have seen the application of these principles literally revolutionize the lives of many people.</p><p>To illustrate: A man with 314 employees joined one of these courses. For years, he had driven and criticized and condemned his employees without stint or discretion.</p><p>Kindness, words of appreciation and encouragement were alien to his lips. After studying the principles discussed in this book, this employer sharply altered his philosophy of life. His organization is now inspired with a new loyalty, a new enthusiasm, a new spirit of team- work. Three hundred and fourteen enemies have been turned into 314 friends. As he proudly said in a speech before the class: “When I used to walk through my establishment, no one greeted me. My employees actually looked the other way when they saw me approaching.</p><p>But now they are all my friends and even the janitor calls me by my first name.”</p><p>This employer gained more profit, more leisure and</p><p>-what is infinitely more important-he found far more happiness in his business and in his home.</p><p>Countless numbers of salespeople have sharply increased their sales by the use of these principles. Many have opened up new accounts - accounts that they had formerly solicited in vain. Executives have been given increased authority, increased pay. One executive reported a large increase in salary because he applied these truths. Another, an executive in the Philadelphia</p><p>Gas Works Company, was slated for demotion when he was sixty-five because of his belligerence, because of his inability to lead people skillfully. This training not only saved him from the demotion but brought him a promotion with increased pay.</p><p>On innumerable occasions, spouses attending the banquet given at the end of the course have told me that their homes have been much happier since their husbands or wives started this training.</p><p>People are frequently astonished at the new results they achieve. It all seems like magic. In some cases, in their enthusiasm, they have telephoned me at my home on Sundays because they couldn’t wait forty-eight hours to report their achievements at the regular session of the course.</p><p>One man was so stirred by a talk on these principles that he sat far into the night discussing them with other members of the class. At three o’clock in the morning, the others went home. But he was so shaken by a realization of his own mistakes, so inspired by the vista of a new and richer world opening before him, that he was unable to sleep. He didn’t sleep that night or the next day or the next night.</p><p>Who was he? A naive, untrained individual ready to gush over any new theory that came along? No, Far from it. He was a sophisticated, blasé dealer in art, very much the man about town, who spoke three languages fluently and was a graduate of two European universities.</p><p>While writing this chapter, I received a letter from a</p><p>German of the old school, an aristocrat whose forebears had served for generations as professional army officers under the Hohenzollerns. His letter, written from a transatlantic steamer, telling about the application of these principles, rose almost to a religious fervor.</p><p>Another man, an old New Yorker, a Harvard graduate, a wealthy man, the owner of a large carpet factory, declared he had learned more in fourteen weeks through this system of training about the fine art of influencing people than he had learned about the same subject during his four years in college. Absurd? Laughable? Fantastic?</p><p>Of course, you are privileged to dismiss this statement with whatever adjective you wish. I am merely reporting, without comment, a declaration made by a conservative and eminently successful Harvard graduate in a public address to approximately six hundred people at the Yale Club in New York on the evening of Thursday, February 23, 1933.</p><p>“Compared to what we ought to be,” said the famous</p><p>Professor William James of Harvard, “compared to what we ought to be, we are only half awake. We are making use of only a small part of our physical and mental resources.</p><p>Stating the thing broadly, the human individual thus lives far within his limits. He possesses powers of various sorts which he habitually fails to use,”</p><p>Those powers which you “habitually fail to use”! The sole purpose of this book is to help you discover, develop and profit by those dormant and unused assets,</p><p>“Education,” said Dr. John G. Hibben, former president of Princeton University, “is the ability to meet life’s situations,”</p><p>If by the time you have finished reading the first three chapters of this book- if you aren’t then a little better equipped to meet life’s situations, then I shall consider this book to be a total failure so far as you are concerned.</p><p>For “the great aim of education,” said Herbert Spencer,</p><p>“is not knowledge but action.”</p><p>And this is an action book.</p><p>DALE CARNEGIENine Suggestions on How to Get the Most</p><p>Out of This Book</p><ol><li>If you wish to get the most out of this book, there is one indispensable requirement, one essential infinitely more important than any rule or technique. Unless you have this one fundamental requisite, a thousand rules on how to study will avail little, And if you do have this cardinal endowment, then you can achieve wonders without reading any suggestions for getting the most out of a book.</li></ol><p>What is this magic requirement? Just this: a deep, driving desire to learn, a vigorous determination to increase your ability to deal with people.</p><p>How can you develop such an urge? By constantly reminding yourself how important these principles are to you. Picture to yourself how their mastery will aid you in leading a richer, fuller, happier and more fulfilling life. Say to yourself over and over: &quot;My popularity, my happiness and sense of worth depend to no small extent upon my skill in dealing with people.”</p><ol start="2"><li><p>Read each chapter rapidly at first to get a bird&#x27;s-eye view of it. You will probably be tempted then to rush on to the next one. But don’t - unless you are reading merely for entertainment. But if you are reading because you want to increase your skill in human relations, then go back and reread each chapter thoroughly. In the long run, this will mean saving time and getting results.</p></li><li><p>Stop frequently in your reading to think over what you are reading. Ask yourself just how and when you can apply each suggestion.</p></li><li><p>Read with a crayon, pencil, pen, magic marker or highlighter in your hand. When you come across a suggestion that you feel you can use, draw a line beside it.</p></li></ol><p>If it is a four-star suggestion, then underscore every sentence or highlight it, or mark it with “****.” Marking and underscoring a book makes it more interesting, and far easier to review rapidly.</p><ol start="5"><li>I knew a woman who had been office manager for a large insurance concern for fifteen years. Every month, she read all the insurance contracts her company had issued that month. Yes, she read many of the same contracts over month after month, year after year. Why? Because experience had taught her that that was the only way she could keep their provisions clearly in mind.</li></ol><p>I once spent almost two years writing a book on public speaking and yet I found I had to keep going back over it from time to time in order to remember what I had written in my own book. The rapidity with which we forget is astonishing.</p><p>So, if you want to get a real, lasting benefit out of this book, don’t imagine that skimming through it once will suffice. After reading it thoroughly, you ought to spend a few hours reviewing it every month, Keep it on your desk in front of you every day. Glance through it often.</p><p>Keep constantly impressing yourself with the rich possibilities for improvement that still lie in the offing. Remember that the use of these principles can be made habitual only by a constant and vigorous campaign of review and application. There is no other way.</p><ol start="6"><li>Bernard Shaw once remarked: “If you teach a man anything, he will never learn.” Shaw was right. Learning is an active process. We learn by doing. So, if you desire to master the principles you are studying in this book, do something about them. Apply these rules at every opportunity. If you don’t you will forget them quickly. Only knowledge that is used sticks in your mind.</li></ol><p>You will probably find it difficult to apply these suggestions all the time. I know because I wrote the book, and yet frequently I found it difficult to apply everything</p><p>I advocated. For example, when you are displeased, it is much easier to criticize and condemn than it is to try to understand the other person’s viewpoint. It is frequently easier to find fault than to find praise. It is more natural to talk about what vou want than to talk about what the other person wants. And so on, So, as you read this book, remember that you are not merely trying to acquire information.</p><p>You are attempting to form new habits. Ah yes, you are attempting a new way of life. That will require time and persistence and daily application.</p><p>So refer to these pages often. Regard this as a working handbook on human relations; and whenever you are confronted with some specific problem - such as handling a child, winning your spouse to your way of thinking, or satisfying an irritated customer - hesitate about doing the natural thing, the impulsive thing. This is usually wrong. Instead, turn to these pages and review the paragraphs you have underscored. Then try these new ways and watch them achieve magic for you.</p><ol start="7"><li><p>Offer your spouse, your child or some business  associate a dime or a dollar every time he or she catches you violating a certain principle. Make a lively game out of mastering these rules.</p></li><li><p>The president of an important Wall Street bank once described, in a talk before one of my classes, a highly efficient system he used for self-improvement.</p></li></ol><p>This man had little formal schooling; yet he had become one of the most important financiers in America, and he confessed that he owed most of his success to the constant application of his homemade system. This is what he does, I’ll put it in his own words as accurately as I can remember.</p><p>“For years I have kept an engagement book showing all the appointments I had during the day. My family never made any plans for me on Saturday night, for the family knew that I devoted a part of each Saturday evening to the illuminating process of self-examination and review and appraisal. After dinner I went off by myself, opened my engagement book, and thought over all the interviews, discussions and meetings that had taken place during the week. I asked myself:</p><p>‘What mistakes did I make that time?’</p><p>‘What did I do that was right-and in what way could I have improved my performance?’</p><p>‘What lessons can I learn from that experience?’</p><p>“I often found that this weekly review made me very unhappy. I was frequently astonished at my own blunders.</p><p>Of course, as the years passed, these blunders became less frequent. Sometimes I was inclined to pat myself on the back a little after one of these sessions.</p><p>This system of self-analysis, self-education, continued year after year, did more for me than any other one thing</p><p>I have ever attempted.</p><p>“It helped me improve my ability to make decisions</p><ul><li>and it aided me enormously in all my contacts with people. I cannot recommend it too highly.”</li></ul><p>Why not use a similar system to check up on your application of the principles discussed in this book? If you do, two things will result.</p><p>First, you will find yourself engaged in an educational process that is both intriguing and priceless.</p><p>Second, you will find that your ability to meet and deal with people will grow enormously.</p><ol start="9"><li>You will find at the end of this book several blank pages on which you should record your triumphs in the application of these principles. Be specific. Give names, dates, results. Keeping such a record will inspire you to greater efforts; and how fascinating these entries will be when you chance upon them some evening years from now!</li></ol><p>In order to get the most out of this book: a. Develop a deep, driving desire to master the principles of human relations, b. Read each chapter twice before going on to the next one. c. As you read, stop frequently to ask yourself how you can apply each suggestion. d. Underscore each important idea. e. Review this book each month. f . Apply these principles at every opportunity. Use this volume as a working handbook to help you solve your daily problems. g. Make a lively game out of your learning by offering some friend a dime or a dollar every time he or she catches you violating one of these principles. h. Check up each week on the progress you are mak-ing.</p><p>Ask yourself what mistakes you have made, what improvement, what lessons you have learned for the future. i.

After weeks of search, “Two Gun” Crowley - the killer, the gunman who didn’t smoke or drink - was at bay, trapped in his sweetheart’s apartment on West End Avenue.</p><p>One hundred and fifty policemen and detectives laid siege to his top-floor hideway. They chopped holes in the roof; they tried to smoke out Crowley, the “cop killer,” with teargas. Then they mounted their machine guns on surrounding buildings, and for more than an hour one of New York’s fine residential areas reverberated with the crack of pistol fire and the rut-tat-tat of machine guns. Crowley, crouching behind an over- stuffed chair, fired incessantly at the police. Ten thousand excited people watched the battle. Nothing like it ever been seen before on the sidewalks of New</p><p>York.</p><p>When Crowley was captured, Police Commissioner</p><p>E. P. Mulrooney declared that the two-gun desperado was one of the most dangerous criminals ever encountered in the history of New York. “He will kill,” said the</p><p>Commissioner, “at the drop of a feather.”</p><p>But how did “Two Gun” Crowley regard himself? We know, because while the police were firing into his apartment, he wrote a letter addressed “To whom it may concern, ” And, as he wrote, the blood flowing from his wounds left a crimson trail on the paper. In this letter</p><p>Crowley said: “Under my coat is a weary heart, but a kind one - one that would do nobody any harm.”</p><p>A short time before this, Crowley had been having a necking party with his girl friend on a country road out on Long Island. Suddenly a policeman walked up to the car and said: “Let me see your license.”</p><p>Without saying a word, Crowley drew his gun and cut the policeman down with a shower of lead. As the dying officer fell, Crowley leaped out of the car, grabbed the officer’s revolver, and fired another bullet into the prostrate body. And that was the killer who said: “Under my coat is a weary heart, but a kind one - one that would do nobody any harm.’</p><p>Crowley was sentenced to the electric chair. When he arrived at the death house in Sing Sing, did he say, “This is what I get for killing people”? No, he said: “This is what I get for defending myself.”</p><p>The point of the story is this: “Two Gun” Crowley didn’t blame himself for anything.</p><p>Is that an unusual attitude among criminals? If you think so, listen to this:</p><p>“I have spent the best years of my life giving people the lighter pleasures, helping them have a good time, and all I get is abuse, the existence of a hunted man.”</p><p>That’s Al Capone speaking. Yes, America’s most notorious</p><p>Public Enemy- the most sinister gang leader who ever shot up Chicago. Capone didn’t condemn himself.</p><p>He actually regarded himself as a public benefactor - an unappreciated and misunderstood public benefactor.</p><p>And so did Dutch Schultz before he crumpled up under gangster bullets in Newark. Dutch Schultz, one of</p><p>New York’s most notorious rats, said in a newspaper interview that he was a public benefactor. And he believed it.</p><p>I have had some interesting correspondence with</p><p>Lewis Lawes, who was warden of New York’s infamous</p><p>Sing Sing prison for many years, on this subject, and he declared that “few of the criminals in Sing Sing regard themselves as bad men. They are just as human as you and I. So they rationalize, they explain. They can tell you why they had to crack a safe or be quick on the trigger finger. Most of them attempt by a form of reasoning, fallacious or logical, to justify their antisocial acts even to themselves, consequently stoutly maintaining that they should never have been imprisoned at all.”</p><p>If Al Capone, “Two Gun” Crowley, Dutch Schultz, and the desperate men and women behind prison walls don’t blame themselves for anything - what about the people with whom you and I come in contact?</p><p>John Wanamaker, founder of the stores that bear his name, once confessed: “I learned thirty years ago that it is foolish to scold. I have enough trouble overcoming my own limitations without fretting over the fact that God has not seen fit to distribute evenly the gift of intelligence.”</p><p>Wanamaker learned this lesson early, but I personally had to blunder through this old world for a third of a century before it even began to dawn upon me that ninety-nine times out of a hundred, people don’t criticize themselves for anything, no matter how wrong it may be.</p><p>Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself.</p><p>Criticism is dangerous, because it wounds a person’s precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses resentment.</p><p>B. F. Skinner, the world-famous psychologist, proved through his experiments that an animal rewarded for good behavior will learn much more rapidly and retain what it learns far more effectively than an animal punished for bad behavior. Later studies have shown that the same applies to humans. By criticizing, we do not make lasting changes and often incur resentment.</p><p>Hans Selye, another great psychologist, said, “As much as we thirst for approval, we dread condemnation,”</p><p>The resentment that criticism engenders can demoralize employees, family members and friends, and still not correct the situation that has been condemned.</p><p>George B. Johnston of Enid, Oklahoma, is the safety coordinator for an engineering company, One of his re-sponsibilities is to see that employees wear their hard hats whenever they are on the job in the field. He reported that whenever he came across workers who were not wearing hard hats, he would tell them with a lot of authority of the regulation and that they must comply.</p><p>As a result he would get sullen acceptance, and often after he left, the workers would remove the hats.</p><p>He decided to try a different approach. The next time he found some of the workers not wearing their hard hat, he asked if the hats were uncomfortable or did not fit properly. Then he reminded the men in a pleasant tone of voice that the hat was designed to protect them from injury and suggested that it always be worn on the job.</p><p>The result was increased compliance with the regulation with no resentment or emotional upset.</p><p>You will find examples of the futility of criticism bristling on a thousand pages of history, Take, for example, the famous quarrel between Theodore Roosevelt and</p><p>President Taft - a quarrel that split the Republican party, put Woodrow Wilson in the White House, and wrote bold, luminous lines across the First World War and altered the flow of history. Let’s review the facts quickly. When Theodore Roosevelt stepped out of the</p><p>White House in 1908, he supported Taft, who was elected President. Then Theodore Roosevelt went off to</p><p>Africa to shoot lions. When he returned, he exploded.</p><p>He denounced Taft for his conservatism, tried to secure the nomination for a third term himself, formed the Bull</p><p>Moose party, and all but demolished the G.O.P. In the election that followed, William Howard Taft and the Republican party carried only two states - Vermont and</p><p>Utah. The most disastrous defeat the party had ever known.</p><p>Theodore Roosevelt blamed Taft, but did President</p><p>Taft blame himself? Of course not, With tears in his eyes, Taft said: “I don’t see how I could have done any differently from what I have.”</p><p>Who was to blame? Roosevelt or Taft? Frankly, I don’t know, and I don’t care. The point I am trying to make is that all of Theodore Roosevelt’s criticism didn’t persuade</p><p>Taft that he was wrong. It merely made Taft strive to justify himself and to reiterate with tears in his eyes:</p><p>“I don’t see how I could have done any differently from what I have.”</p><p>Or, take the Teapot Dome oil scandal. It kept the newspapers ringing with indignation in the early 1920s.</p><p>It rocked the nation! Within the memory of living men, nothing like it had ever happened before in American public life. Here are the bare facts of the scandal: Albert</p><p>B. Fall, secretary of the interior in Harding’s cabinet, was entrusted with the leasing of government oil reserves at Elk Hill and Teapot Dome - oil reserves that had been set aside for the future use of the Navy. Did secretary Fall permit competitive bidding? No sir. He handed the fat, juicy contract outright to his friend Edward</p><p>L. Doheny. And what did Doheny do? He gave</p><p>Secretary Fall what he was pleased to call a “loan” of one hundred thousand dollars. Then, in a high-handed manner, Secretary Fall ordered United States Marines into the district to drive off competitors whose adjacent wells were sapping oil out of the Elk Hill reserves.</p><p>These competitors, driven off their ground at the ends of guns and bayonets, rushed into court - and blew the lid off the Teapot Dome scandal. A stench arose so vile that it ruined the Harding Administration, nauseated an entire nation, threatened to wreck the Republican party, and put Albert B. Fall behind prison bars.</p><p>Fall was condemned viciously - condemned as few men in public life have ever been. Did he repent?</p><p>Never! Years later Herbert Hoover intimated in a public speech that President Harding’s death had been due to mental anxiety and worry because a friend had betrayed him. When Mrs. Fall heard that, she sprang from her chair, she wept, she shook her fists at fate and screamed:</p><p>&quot;What! Harding betrayed by Fall? No! My husband never betrayed anyone. This whole house full of gold would not tempt my husband to do wrong. He is the one who has been betrayed and led to the slaughter and crucified.”</p><p>There you are; human nature in action, wrongdoers, blaming everybody but themselves. We are all like that.</p><p>So when you and I are tempted to criticize someone tomorrow, let’s remember Al Capone, “Two Gun”</p><p>Crowley and Albert Fall. Let’s realize that criticisms are like homing pigeons. They always return home. Let’s realize that the person we are going to correct and condemn will probably justify himself or herself, and condemn us in return; or, like the gentle Taft, will say: “I don’t see how I could have done any differently from what I have.”</p><p>On the morning of April 15, 1865, Abraham Lincoln lay dying in a hall bedroom of a cheap lodging house directly across the street from Ford’s Theater, where</p><p>John Wilkes Booth had shot him. Lincoln’s long body lay stretched diagonally across a sagging bed that was too short for him. A cheap reproduction of Rosa Bonheur’s famous painting The Horse Fair hung above the bed, and a dismal gas jet flickered yellow light.</p><p>As Lincoln lay dying, Secretary of War Stanton said,</p><p>“There lies the most perfect ruler of men that the world has ever seen.”</p><p>What was the secret of Lincoln’s success in dealing with people? I studied the life of Abraham Lincoln for ten years and devoted all of three years to writing and rewriting a book entitled Lincoln the Unknown. I believe</p><p>I have made as detailed and exhaustive a study of</p><p>Lincoln’s personality and home life as it is possible for any being to make. I made a special study of Lincoln’s method of dealing with people. Did he indulge in criticism?</p><p>Oh, yes. As a young man in the Pigeon Creek</p><p>Valley of Indiana, he not only criticized but he wrote letters and poems ridiculing people and dropped these letters on the country roads where they were sure to be found. One of these letters aroused resentments that burned for a lifetime.</p><p>Even after Lincoln had become a practicing lawyer in</p><p>Springfield, Illinois, he attacked his opponents openly in letters published in the newspapers. But he did this just once too often.</p><p>In the autumn of 1842 he ridiculed a vain, pugnacious politician by the name of James Shields. Lincoln lamned him through an anonymous letter published in</p><p>Springfield Journal. The town roared with laughter.</p><p>Shields, sensitive and proud, boiled with indignation.</p><p>He found out who wrote the letter, leaped on his horse, started after Lincoln, and challenged him to fight a duel.</p><p>Lincoln didn’t want to fight. He was opposed to dueling, but he couldn’t get out of it and save his honor. He was given the choice of weapons. Since he had very long arms, he chose cavalry broadswords and took lessons in sword fighting from a West Point graduate; and, on the appointed day, he and Shields met on a sandbar in the</p><p>Mississippi River, prepared to fight to the death; but, at the last minute, their seconds interrupted and stopped the duel.</p><p>That was the most lurid personal incident in Lincoln’s life. It taught him an invaluable lesson in the art of dealing with people. Never again did he write an insulting letter. Never again did he ridicule anyone. And from that time on, he almost never criticized anybody for anything.</p><p>Time after time, during the Civil War, Lincoln put a new general at the head of the Army of the Potomac, and each one in turn - McClellan, Pope, Burnside, Hooker,</p><p>Meade - blundered tragically and drove Lincoln to pacing the floor in despair. Half the nation savagely condemned these incompetent generals, but Lincoln, “with malice toward none, with charity for all,” held his peace.</p><p>One of his favorite quotations was “Judge not, that ye be not judged.”</p><p>And when Mrs. Lincoln and others spoke harshly of the southern people, Lincoln replied: “Don’t criticize them; they are just what we would be under similar circumstances.”</p><p>Yet if any man ever had occasion to criticize, surely it was Lincoln. Let’s take just one illustration:</p><p>The Battle of Gettysburg was fought during the first three days of July 1863. During the night of July 4, Lee began to retreat southward while storm clouds deluged the country with rain. When Lee reached the Potomac with his defeated army, he found a swollen, impassable river in front of him, and a victorious Union Army behind him. Lee was in a trap. He couldn’t escape. Lincoln saw that. Here was a golden, heaven-sent opportunity- the opportunity to capture Lee’s army and end the war immediately. So, with a surge of high hope, Lincoln ordered</p><p>Meade not to call a council of war but to attack</p><p>Lee immediately. Lincoln telegraphed his orders and then sent a special messenger to Meade demanding immediate action.</p><p>And what did General Meade do? He did the very opposite of what he was told to do. He called a council of war in direct violation of Lincoln’s orders. He hesitated.</p><p>He procrastinated. He telegraphed all manner of excuses. He refused point-blank to attack Lee. Finally the waters receded and Lee escaped over the Potomac with his forces.</p><p>Lincoln was furious, “ What does this mean?” Lincoln cried to his son Robert. “Great God! What does this mean? We had them within our grasp, and had only to stretch forth our hands and they were ours; yet nothing that I could say or do could make the army move. Under the circumstances, almost any general could have defeated</p><p>Lee. If I had gone up there, I could have whipped him myself.”</p><p>In bitter disappointment, Lincoln sat down and wrote</p><p>Meade this letter. And remember, at this period of his life Lincoln was extremely conservative and restrained in his phraseology. So this letter coming from Lincoln in</p><p>1863 was tantamount to the severest rebuke.</p><p>My dear General,</p><p>I do not believe you appreciate the magnitude of the misfortune involved in Lee’s escape. He was within our easy grasp, and to have closed upon him would, in connection</p><p>With our other late successes, have ended the war. As it is, the war will be prolonged indefinitely. If you could not safely attack Lee last Monday, how can you possibly do so south of the river, when you can take with you very few- no more than two-thirds of the force you then had in hand?</p><p>It would be unreasonable to expect and I do not expect that you can now effect much. Your golden opportunity is gone, and I am distressed immeasurably because of it.</p><p>What do you suppose Meade did when he read the letter?</p><p>Meade never saw that letter. Lincoln never mailed it.</p><p>It was found among his papers after his death.</p><p>My guess is - and this is only a guess - that after writing that letter, Lincoln looked out of the window and said to himself, “Just a minute. Maybe I ought not to be so hasty. It is easy enough for me to sit here in the quiet of the White House and order Meade to attack; but if I had been up at Gettysburg, and if I had seen as much blood as Meade has seen during the last week, and if my ears had been pierced with the screams and shrieks of the wounded and dying, maybe I wouldn’t be so anxious to attack either. If I had Meade’s timid temperament, perhaps I would have done just what he had done. Anyhow, it is water under the bridge now. If I send this letter, it will relieve my feelings, but it will make Meade try to justify himself. It will make him condemn me. It will arouse hard feelings, impair all his further usefulness as a commander, and perhaps force him to resign from the army.”</p><p>So, as I have already said, Lincoln put the letter aside, for he had learned by bitter experience that sharp criticisms and rebukes almost invariably end in futility.</p><p>Theodore Roosevelt said that when he, as President, was confronted with a perplexing problem, he used to lean back and look up at a large painting of Lincoln which hung above his desk in the White House and ask himself, “What would Lincoln do if he were in my shoes? How would he solve this problem?”</p><p>The next time we are tempted to admonish somebody,</p><p>/let’s pull a five-dollar bill out of our pocket, look at Lincoln’s picture on the bill, and ask. “How would Lincoln handle this problem if he had it?”</p><p>Mark Twain lost his temper occasionally and wrote letters that turned the Paper brown. For example, he once wrote to a man who had aroused his ire: “The thing for you is a burial permit. You have only to speak and I will see that you get it.” On another occasion he wrote to an editor about a proofreader’s attempts to “improve my spelling and punctuation.” He ordered: “Set the matter according to my copy hereafter and see that the proofreader retains his suggestions in the mush of his decayed brain.”</p><p>The writing of these stinging letters made Mark Twain feel better. They allowed him to blow off steam, and the letters didn’t do any real harm, because Mark’s wife secretly lifted them out of the mail. They were never sent.</p><p>Do you know someone you would like to change and regulate and improve? Good! That is fine. I am all in favor of it, But why not begin on yourself? From a purely selfish standpoint, that is a lot more profitable than trying to improve others - yes, and a lot less dangerous.</p><p>“Don’t complain about the snow on your neighbor’s roof,” said Confucius, “when your own doorstep is unclean.”</p><p>When I was still young and trying hard to impress people, I wrote a foolish letter to Richard Harding</p><p>Davis, an author who once loomed large on the literary horizon of America. I was preparing a magazine article about authors, and I asked Davis to tell me about his method of work. A few weeks earlier, I had received a letter from someone with this notation at the bottom:</p><p>“Dictated but not read.” I was quite impressed. I felt that the writer must be very big and busy and important.</p><p>I wasn’t the slightest bit busy, but I was eager to make an impression on Richard Harding Davis, so I ended my short note with the words: “Dictated but not read.”</p><p>He never troubled to answer the letter. He simply returned it to me with this scribbled across the bottom:</p><p>“Your bad manners are exceeded only by your bad manners.”</p><p>True, I had blundered, and perhaps I deserved this rebuke. But, being human, I resented it. I resented it so sharply that when I read of the death of Richard</p><p>Harding Davis ten years later, the one thought that still persisted in my mind - I am ashamed to admit - was the hurt he had given me.</p><p>If you and I want to stir up a resentment tomorrow that may rankle across the decades and endure until death, just let us indulge in a little stinging criticism- no matter how certain we are that it is justified.</p><p>When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.</p><p>Bitter criticism caused the sensitive Thomas Hardy, one of the finest novelists ever to enrich English literature, to give up forever the writing of fiction. Criticism drove Thomas Chatterton, the English poet, to suicide.</p><p>Benjamin Franklin, tactless in his youth, became so diplomatic, so adroit at handling people, that he was made American Ambassador to France. The secret of his success? “I will speak ill of no man,” he said, &quot; . . and speak all the good I know of everybody.”</p><p>Any fool can criticize, condemn and complain - and most fools do.</p><p>But it takes character and self-control to be under-standing and forgiving.</p><p>“A great man shows his greatness,” said Carlyle, “by the way he treats little men.”</p><p>Bob Hoover, a famous test pilot and frequent per-former at air shows, was returning to his home in Los</p><p>Angeles from an air show in San Diego. As described in the magazine Flight Operations, at three hundred feet in the air, both engines suddenly stopped. By deft maneuvering he managed to land the plane, but it was badly damaged although nobody was hurt.</p><p>Hoover’s first act after the emergency landing was to inspect the airplane’s fuel. Just as he suspected, the</p><p>World War II propeller plane he had been flying had been fueled with jet fuel rather than gasoline.</p><p>Upon returning to the airport, he asked to see the mechanic who had serviced his airplane. The young man was sick with the agony of his mistake. Tears streamed down his face as Hoover approached. He had just caused the loss of a very expensive plane and could have caused the loss of three lives as well.</p><p>You can imagine Hoover’s anger. One could anticipate the tongue-lashing that this proud and precise pilot would unleash for that carelessness. But Hoover didn’t scold the mechanic; he didn’t even criticize him. Instead, he put his big arm around the man’s shoulder and said, “To show you I’m sure that you’ll never do this again, I want you to service my F-51 tomorrow.”</p><p>Often parents are tempted to criticize their children.</p><p>You would expect me to say “don’t.” But I will not, I am merely going to say, “Before you criticize them, read one of the classics of American journalism, ‘Father Forgets.’ ”</p><p>It originally appeared as an editorial in the People&#x27;s </p><p>Home Journnl. We are reprinting it here with the  author’s permission, as condensed in the Reader’s Digest:</p><p>“Father Forgets” is one of those little pieces which- dashed of in a moment of sincere feeling - strikes an echoing chord in so many readers as to become a perenial reprint favorite. Since its first appearance, “Father</p><p>Forgets&quot; has been reproduced, writes the author,</p><p>W, Livingston Larned, “in hundreds of magazines and house organs, and in newspapers the country over. It has been reprinted almost as extensively in many foreign languages. I have given personal permission to thousands who wished to read it from school, church, and lecture platforms. It has been ‘on the air’ on countless occasions and programs. Oddly enough, college periodicals have used it, and high-school magazines. Sometimes a little piece seems mysteriously to ‘click.’ This one certainly did.”</p><p>FATHER FORGETS</p><p>W. Livingston Larned</p><p>Listen, son: I am saying this as you lie asleep, one little paw crumpled under your cheek and the blond curls stickily wet on your damp forehead. I have stolen into your room alone. Just a few minutes ago, as I sat reading my paper in the library, a stifling wave of remorse swept over me.</p><p>Guiltily I came to your bedside.</p><p>There are the things I was thinking, son: I had been cross to you. I scolded you as you were dressing for school because you gave your face merely a dab with a towel. I took you to task for not cleaning your shoes. I called out angrily when you threw some of your things on the floor.</p><p>At breakfast I found fault, too. You spilled things. You gulped down your food. You put your elbows on the table.</p><p>You spread butter too thick on your bread. And as you started off to play and I made for my train, you turned and waved a hand and called, “Goodbye, Daddy!” and</p><p>I frowned, and said in reply, “Hold your shoulders back!”</p><p>Then it began all over again in the late afternoon. As I came up the road I spied you, down on your knees, playing marbles. There were holes in your stockings. I humiliated you before your boyfriends by marching you ahead of me to the house. Stockings were expensive - and if you had to buy them you would be more careful! Imagine that, son, from a father!</p><p>Do you remember, later, when I was reading in the library, how you came in timidly, with a sort of hurt look in your eyes? When I glanced up over my paper, impatient at the interruption, you hesitated at the door. “What is it you want?” I snapped.</p><p>You said nothing, but ran across in one tempestuous plunge, and threw your arms around my neck and kissed me, and your small arms tightened with an affection that</p><p>God had set blooming in your heart and which even neglect could not wither. And then you were gone, pattering up the stairs.</p><p>Well, son, it was shortly afterwards that my paper slipped from my hands and a terrible sickening fear came over me.</p><p>What has habit been doing to me? The habit of finding fault, of reprimanding - this was my reward to you for being a boy. It was not that I did not love you; it was that I expected too much of youth. I was measuring you by the yardstick of my own years.</p><p>And there was so much that was good and fine and true in your character. The little heart of you was as big as the dawn itself over the wide hills. This was shown by your spontaneous impulse to rush in and kiss me good night.</p><p>Nothing else matters tonight, son. I have come to your bed-side in the darkness, and I have knelt there, ashamed!</p><p>It is a feeble atonement; I know you would not understand these things if I told them to you during your waking hours. But tomorrow I will be a real daddy! I will chum with you, and suffer when you suffer, and laugh when you laugh. I will bite my tongue when impatient words come. I will keep saying as if it were a ritual: “He is nothing but a boy - a little boy!”</p><p>I am afraid I have visualized you as a man. Yet as I see you now, son, crumpled and weary in your cot, I see that you are still a baby. Yesterday you were in your mother’s arms, your head on her shoulder. I have asked too much, too much.</p><p>Instead of condemning people, let’s try to understand them. Let’s try to figure out why they do what they do.</p><p>That’s a lot more profitable and intriguing than criticism; and it breeds sympathy, tolerance and kindness. “To know all is to forgive all.”</p><p>As Dr. Johnson said: “God himself, sir, does not propose to judge man until the end of his days.”</p><p>Why should you and I?</p><p>PRINCIPLE 1Don’t criticize, condemn or complain.THE BIG SECRET OF DEALING WITHPEOPLEThere is only one way under high heaven to get anybody to do anything. Did you ever stop to think of that? Yes, just one way. And that is by making the other person want to do it.</p><p>Remember, there is no other way.</p><p>Of course, you can make someone want to give you his watch by sticking a revolver in his ribs. YOU can make your employees give you cooperation - until your back is turned - by threatening to fire them. You can make a child do what you want it to do by a whip or a threat. But these crude methods have sharply undesirable repercussions.</p><p>The only way I can get you to do anything is by giving you what you want.</p><p>What do you want?</p><p>Sigmund Freud said that everything you and I do springs from two motives: the sex urge and the desire to be great.</p><p>John Dewey, one of America’s most profound philosophers, phrased it a bit differently. Dr. Dewey said that the deepest urge in human nature is “the desire to be important.&quot; Remember that phrase: “the desire to be important.&quot; It is significant. You are going to hear a lot about it in this book.</p><p>What do you want? Not many things, but the few that you do wish, you crave with an insistence that will not be denied. Some of the things most people want include:</p><ol><li><p>Health and the preservation of life.</p></li><li><p>Food.</p></li><li><p>Sleep.</p></li><li><p>Money and the things money will buy.</p></li><li><p>Life in the hereafter.</p></li><li><p>Sexual gratification.</p></li><li><p>The well-being of our children.</p></li><li><p>A feeling of importance.</p></li></ol><p>Almost all these wants are usually gratified-all except one. But there is one longing - almost as deep, almost as imperious, as the desire for food or sleep - which is seldom gratified. It is what Freud calls “the desire to be great.” It is what Dewey calls the “desire to be important.”</p><p>Lincoln once began a letter saying: “Everybody likes a compliment.” William James said: &quot;The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.&quot;</p><p>He didn’t speak, mind you, of the “wish” or the “desire” or the “longing” to be appreciated. He said the &quot;craving” to be appreciated.</p><p>Here is a gnawing and unfaltering human hunger, and the rare individual who honestly satisfies this heart hunger will hold people in the palm of his or her hand and</p><p>“even the undertaker will be sorry when he dies.”</p><p>The desire for a feeling of importance is one of the chief distinguishing differences between mankind and the animals. To illustrate: When I was a farm boy out in</p><p>Missouri, my father bred fine Duroc-Jersey hogs and . pedigreed white - faced cattle. We used to exhibit our hogs and white-faced cattle at the country fairs and live-stock shows throughout the Middle West. We won first prizes by the score. My father pinned his blue ribbons on a sheet of white muslin, and when friends or visitors came to the house, he would get out the long sheet of muslin. He would hold one end and I would hold the other while he exhibited the blue ribbons.</p><p>The hogs didn’t care about the ribbons they had won.</p><p>But Father did. These prizes gave him a feeling of importance.</p><p>If our ancestors hadn’t had this flaming urge for a feeling of importance, civilization would have been impossible.</p><p>Without it, we should have been just about like animals.</p><p>It was this desire for a feeling of importance that led an uneducated, poverty-stricken grocery clerk to study some law books he found in the bottom of a barrel of household plunder that he had bought for fifty cents.</p><p>You have probably heard of this grocery clerk. His name was Lincoln.</p><p>It was this desire for a feeling of importance that inspired</p><p>Dickens to write his immortal novels. This desire inspired Sir Christoper Wren to design his symphonies in stone. This desire made Rockefeller amass millions that he never spent! And this same desire made the richest family in your town build a house far too large for its requirements.</p><p>This desire makes you want to wear the latest styles, drive the latest cars, and talk about your brilliant children.</p><p>It is this desire that lures many boys and girls into joining gangs and engaging in criminal activities. The average young criminal, according to E. P. Mulrooney, onetime police commissioner of New York, is filled with ego, and his first request after arrest is for those lurid newspapers that make him out a hero. The disagreeable prospect of serving time seems remote so long as he can gloat over his likeness sharing space with pictures of sports figures, movie and TV stars and politicians.</p><p>If you tell me how you get your feeling of importance,</p><p>I’ll tell you what you are. That determines your character.</p><p>That is the most significant thing about you. For example, John D. Rockefeller got his feeling of importance by giving money to erect a modern hospital in</p><p>Peking, China, to care for millions of poor people whom he had never seen and never would see. Dillinger, on the other hand, got his feeling of importance by being a bandit, a bank robber and killer. When the FBI agents were hunting him, he dashed into a farmhouse up in</p><p>Minnesota and said, “I’m Dillinger!” He was proud of the fact that he was Public Enemy Number One. “I’m not going to hurt you, but I’m Dillinger!” he said.</p><p>Yes, the one significant difference between Dillinger and Rockefeller is how they got their feeling of importance.</p><p>History sparkles with amusing examples of famous people struggling for a feeling of importance. Even</p><p>George Washington wanted to be called “His Mightiness, the President of the United States”; and Columbus pleaded for the title “Admiral of the Ocean and Viceroy of India.” Catherine the Great refused to open letters that were not addressed to “Her Imperial Majesty”; and</p><p>Mrs. Lincoln, in the White House, turned upon Mrs.</p><p>Grant like a tigress and shouted, “How dare you be seated in my presence until I invite you!”</p><p>Our millionaires helped finance Admiral Byrd’s expedition to the Antarctic in 1928 with the understanding that ranges of icy mountains would be named after them; and Victor Hugo aspired to have nothing less than the city of Paris renamed in his honor. Even Shakespeare, mightiest of the mighty, tried to add luster to his name by procuring a coat of arms for his family.</p><p>People sometimes became invalids in order to win sympathy and attention, and get a feeling of importance.</p><p>For example, take Mrs. McKinley. She got a feeling of importance by forcing her husband, the President of the</p><p>United States, to neglect important affairs of state while he reclined on the bed beside her for hours at a time, his arm about her, soothing her to sleep. She fed her gnawing desire for attention by insisting that he remain with her while she was having her teeth fixed, and once created a stormy scene when he had to leave her alone with the dentist while he kept an appointment with John</p><p>Hay, his secretary of state.</p><p>The writer Mary Roberts Rinehart once told me of a bright, vigorous young woman who became an invalid in order to get a feeling of importance. “One day,” said</p><p>Mrs. Rinehart, “this woman had been obliged to face something, her age perhaps. The lonely years were stretching ahead and there was little left for her to anticipate.</p><p>“She took to her bed; and for ten years her old mother traveled to the third floor and back, carrying trays, nursing her. Then one day the old mother, weary with service, lay down and died. For some weeks, the invalid languished; then she got up, put on her clothing, and resumed living again.”</p><p>Some authorities declare that people may actually go insane in order to find, in the dreamland of insanity, the feeling of importance that has been denied them in the harsh world of reality. There are more patients suffering from mental diseases in the United States than from all other diseases combined.</p><p>What is the cause of insanity?</p><p>Nobody can answer such a sweeping question, but we know that certain diseases, such as syphilis, break down and destroy the brain cells and result in insanity. In fact, about one-half of all mental diseases can be attributed to such physical causes as brain lesions, alcohol, toxins and injuries. But the other half - and this is the appalling part of the story - the other half of the people who go insane apparently have nothing organically wrong with their brain cells. In post-mortem examinations, when their brain tissues are studied under the highest-powered microscopes, these tissues are found to be apparently just as healthy as yours and mine.</p><p>Why do these people go insane?</p><p>I put that question to the head physician of one of our most important psychiatric hospitals. This doctor, who has received the highest honors and the most coveted awards for his knowledge of this subject, told me frankly that he didn’t know why people went insane. Nobody knows for sure But he did say that many people who go insane find in insanity a feeling of importance that they were unable to achieve in the world of reality. Then he told me this story:</p><p>&quot;I have a patient right now whose marriage proved to be a tragedy. She wanted love, sexual gratification, children and social prestige, but life blasted all her hopes.</p><p>Her husband didn’t love her. He refused even to eat with her and forced her to serve his meals in his room upstairs. She had no children, no social standing. She went insane; and, in her imagination, she divorced her husband and resumed her maiden name. She now believes she has married into English aristocracy, and she insists on being called Lady Smith.</p><p>“And as for children, she imagines now that she has had a new child every night. Each time I call on her she says: ‘Doctor, I had a baby last night.’ &quot;</p><p>Life once wrecked all her dream ships on the sharp rocks of reality; but in the sunny, fantasy isles of insanity, all her barkentines race into port with canvas billowing and winds singing through the masts.</p><p>&quot; Tragic? Oh, I don’t know. Her physician said to me:</p><p>If I could stretch out my hand and restore her sanity, I wouldn’t do it. She’s much happier as she is.&quot;</p><p>If some people are so hungry for a feeling of importance that they actually go insane to get it, imagine what miracle you and I can achieve by giving people honest appreciation this side of insanity.</p><p>One of the first people in American business to be paid a salary of over a million dollars a year (when there was no income tax and a person earning fifty dollars a week was considered well off) was Charles Schwab, He had been picked by Andrew Carnegie to become the first president of the newly formed United States Steel</p><p>Company in 1921, when Schwab was only thirty-eight years old. (Schwab later left U.S. Steel to take over the then-troubled Bethlehem Steel Company, and he rebuilt it into one of the most profitable companies in America.)</p><p>Why did Andrew Carnegie pay a million dollars a year, or more than three thousand dollars a day, to</p><p>Charles Schwab? Why? Because Schwab was a genius?</p><p>No. Because he knew more about the manufacture of steel than other people? Nonsense. Charles Schwab told me himself that he had many men working for him who knew more about the manufacture of steel than he did.</p><p>Schwab says that he was paid this salary largely because of his ability to deal with people. I asked him how he did it. Here is his secret set down in his own words</p><ul><li>words that ought to be cast in eternal bronze and hung in every home and school, every shop and office in the land - words that children ought to memorize instead of wasting their time memorizing the conjugation of Latin verbs or the amount of the annual rainfall in Brazil - words that will all but transform your life and mine if we will only live them:</li></ul><p>“I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people,” said Schwab, “the greatest asset I possess, and the way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement.</p><p>“There is nothing else that so kills the ambitions of a person as criticisms from superiors. I never criticize any- one. I believe in giving a person incentive to work. So I am anxious to praise but loath to find fault. If I like anything,</p><p>I am hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise. &quot;</p><p>That is what Schwab did. But what do average people do? The exact opposite. If they don’t like a thing, they bawl out their subordinates; if they do like it, they say nothing. As the old couplet says: “Once I did bad and that I heard ever/Twice I did good, but that I heard never.”</p><p>“In my wide association in life, meeting with many and great people in various parts of the world,” Schwab declared, “I have yet to find the person, however great or exalted his station, who did not do better work and put forth greater effort under a spirit of approval than he would ever do under a spirit of criticism.”</p><p>That he said, frankly, was one of the outstanding reasons for the phenomenal success of Andrew Carnegie.</p><p>Carnegie praised his associates publicly as well as pr-vately.</p><p>Carnegie wanted to praise his assistants even on his tombstone. He wrote an epitaph for himself which read:</p><p>“Here lies one who knew how to get around him men who were cleverer than himself:”</p><p>Sincere appreciation was one of the secrets of the first</p><p>John D. Rockefeller’s success in handling men. For example, when one of his partners, Edward T. Bedford, lost a million dollars for the firm by a bad buy in South</p><p>America, John D. might have criticized; but he knew</p><p>Bedford had done his best - and the incident was closed. So Rockefeller found something to praise; he congratulated Bedford because he had been able to save</p><p>60 percent of the money he had invested. “That’s splendid,&quot; said Rockefeller. “We don’t always do as well as that upstairs.”</p><p>I have among my clippings a story that I know never happened, but it illustrates a truth, so I’ll repeat it:</p><p>According to this silly story, a farm woman, at the end of a heavy day’s work, set before her menfolks a heaping pile of hay. And when they indignantly demanded whether she had gone crazy, she replied: “Why, how did I know you’d notice? I’ve been cooking for you men for the last twenty years and in all that time I ain’t heard no word to let me know you wasn’t just eating hay.”</p><p>When a study was made a few years ago on runaway wives, what do you think was discovered to be the main reason wives ran away? It was “lack of appreciation.”</p><p>And I’d bet that a similar study made of runaway husbands would come out the same way. We often take our spouses so much for granted that we never let them know we appreciate them.</p><p>A member of one of our classes told of a request made by his wife. She and a group of other women in her church were involved in a self-improvement program.</p><p>She asked her husband to help her by listing six things he believed she could do to help her become a better wife. He reported to the class: “I was surprised by such a request. Frankly, it would have been easy for me to list six things I would like to change about her - my heavens, she could have listed a thousand things she would like to change about me - but I didn’t. I said to her, ‘Let me think about it and give you an answer in the morning.’</p><p>“The next morning I got up very early and called the florist and had them send six red roses to my wife with a note saying: ‘I can’t think of six things I would like to change about you. I love you the way you are.’</p><p>“When I arrived at home that evening, who do you think greeted me at the door: That’s right. My wife! She was almost in tears. Needless to say, I was extremely glad I had not criticized her as she had requested.</p><p>“The following Sunday at church, after she had reported the results of her assignment, several women with whom she had been studying came up to me and said, ‘That was the most considerate thing I have ever heard.’ It was then I realized the power of appreciation.”</p><p>Florenz Ziegfeld, the most spectacular producer who ever dazzled Broadway, gained his reputation by his subtle ability to “glorify the American girl.” Time after time, he took drab little creatures that no one ever looked at twice and transformed them on the stage into glamorous visions of mystery and seduction. Knowing the value of appreciation and confidence, he made women feel beautiful by the sheer power of his gallantry and consideration. He was practical: he raised the salary of chorus girls from thirty dollars a week to as high as one hundred and seventy-five. And he was also chivalrous; on opening night at the Follies, he sent telegrams to the stars in the cast, and he deluged every chorus girl in the show with American Beauty roses.</p><p>I once succumbed to the fad of fasting and went for six days and nights without eating. It wasn’t difficult. I was less hungry at the end of the sixth day than I was at the end of the second. Yet I know, as you know, people who would think they had committed a crime if they let their families or employees go for six days without food; but they will let them go for six days, and six weeks, and sometimes sixty years without giving them the hearty appreciation that they crave almost as much as they crave food.</p><p>When Alfred Lunt, one of the great actors of his time, played the leading role in Reunion in Vienna,he said,</p><p>“There is nothing I need so much as nourishment for my self-esteem.”</p><p>We nourish the bodies of our children and friends and employees, but how seldom do we nourish their selfesteem?</p><p>We provide them with roast beef and potatoes to build energy, but we neglect to give them kind words of appreciation that would sing in their memories for years like the music of the morning stars.</p><p>Paul Harvey, in one of his radio broadcasts, “The Rest of the Story,” told how showing sincere appreciation can change a person’s life. He reported that years ago a teacher in Detroit asked Stevie Morris to help her find a mouse that was lost in the classroom. You see, she appreciated the fact that nature had given Stevie something no one else in the room had. Nature had given Stevie a remarkable pair of ears to compensate for his blind eyes.</p><p>But this was really the first time Stevie had been shown appreciation for those talented ears. Now, years later, he says that this act of appreciation was the beginning of a new life. You see, from that time on he developed his gift of hearing and went on to become, under the stage name of Stevie Wonder, one of the great pop singers and and songwriters of the seventies.*</p><ul><li>Paul Aurandt, Paul Harvey’s The Rest the Story (New York: Doubleday,</li></ul><p>1977).

It doesn’t work - not with intelligent people.”</p><p>Of course flattery seldom works with discerning people.</p><p>It is shallow, selfish and insincere. It ought to fail and it usually does. True, some people are so hungry, so thirsty, for appreciation that they will swallow anything, just as a starving man will eat grass and fishworms.</p><p>Even Queen Victoria was susceptible to flattery.</p><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli confessed that he put it on thick in dealing with the Queen. To use his exact words, he said he “spread it on with a trowel.” But Disraeli was one of the most polished, deft and adroit men who ever ruled the far-flung British Empire. He was a genius in his line. What would work for him wouldn’t necessarily work for you and me. In the long run, flattery will do you more harm than good. Flattery is counterfeit, and like counterfeit money, it will eventually get you into trouble if you pass it to someone else.</p><p>The difference between appreciation and flattery?</p><p>That is simple. One is sincere and the other insincere.</p><p>One comes from the heart out; the other from the teeth out. One is unselfish; the other selfish. One is universally admired; the other universally condemned.</p><p>I recently saw a bust of Mexican hero General Alvaro</p><p>Obregon in the Chapultepec palace in Mexico City.</p><p>Below the bust are carved these wise words from General</p><p>Obregon’s philosophy: “Don’t be afraid of enemies who attack you. Be afraid of the friends who flatter you.”</p><p>No! No! No! I am not suggesting flattery! Far from it.</p><p>I’m talking about a new way of life. Let me repeat. Iam talking about a new way of life.</p><p>King George V had a set of six maxims displayed on the walls of his study at Buckingham Palace. One of these maxims said: “Teach me neither to proffer nor receive cheap praise.” That’s all flattery is - cheap praise.</p><p>I once read a definition of flattery that may be worth repeating: “Flattery is telling the other person precisely what he thinks about himself.”</p><p>“Use what language you will,” said Ralph Waldo</p><p>Emerson, “you can never say anything but what you are .&quot;</p><p>If all we had to do was flatter, everybody would catch on and we should all be experts in human relations.</p><p>When we are not engaged in thinking about some definite problem, we usually spend about 95 percent of our time thinking about ourselves. Now, if we stop thinking about ourselves for a while and begin to think of the other person’s good points, we won’t have to resort to flattery so cheap and false that it can be spotted almost before it is out of the mouth,</p><p>One of the most neglected virtues of our daily existence is appreciation, Somehow, we neglect to praise our son or daughter when he or she brings home a good report card, and we fail to encourage our children when they first succeed in baking a cake or building a birdhouse.</p><p>Nothing pleases children more than this kind of parental interest and approval.</p><p>The next time you enjoy filet mignon at the club, send word to the chef that it was excellently prepared, and when a tired salesperson shows you unusual courtesy, please mention it.</p><p>Every minister, lecturer and public speaker knows the discouragement of pouring himself or herself out to an audience and not receiving a single ripple of appreciative comment. What applies to professionals applies doubly to workers in offices, shops and factories and our families and friends. In our interpersonal relations we should never forget that all our associates are human beings and hunger for appreciation. It is the legal tender that all souls enjoy.</p><p>Try leaving a friendly trail of little sparks of gratitude on your daily trips. You will be surprised how they will set small flames of friendship that will be rose beacons on your next visit.</p><p>Pamela Dunham of New Fairfield, Connecticut, had among her responsibilities on her job the supervision of a janitor who was doing a very poor job. The other employees would jeer at him and litter the hallways to show him what a bad job he was doing. It was so bad, productive time was being lost in the shop.</p><p>Without success, Pam tried various ways to motivate this person. She noticed that occasionally he did a particularly good piece of work. She made a point to praise him for it in front of the other people. Each day the job he did all around got better, and pretty soon he started doing all his work efficiently. Now he does an excellent job and other people give him appreciation and recognition.</p><p>Honest appreciation got results where criticism and ridicule failed.</p><p>Hurting people not only does not change them, it is never called for. There is an old saying that I have cut out and pasted on my mirror where I cannot help but see it every day:</p><p>I shall pass this way but once; any good, therefore, that I can do or any kindness that I can show to any human being, let me do it now. Let me not defer nor neglect it, for I shall not pass this way again.</p><p>Emerson said: “Every man I meet is my superior in some way, In that, I learn of him.”</p><p>If that was true of Emerson, isn’t it likely to be a thousand times more true of you and me? Let’s cease thinking of our accomplishments, our wants. Let’s try to figure out the other person’s good points. Then forget flattery.</p><p>Give honest, sincere appreciation. Be “hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise,” and people will cherish your words and treasure them and repeat them over a lifetime - repeat them years after you have forgotten them.</p><p>PRINCIPLE 2Give honest and sincere appreciation.“HE WHO CAN DO THIS HAS THEWHOLE WORLD WITH HIM.HE WHO CANNOT WALKSA LONELY WAY”</p><p>I often went fishing up in Maine during the summer.</p><p>Personally I am very fond of strawberries and cream, but</p><p>I have found that for some strange reason, fish prefer worms. So when I went fishing, I didn’t think about what</p><p>I wanted. I thought about what they wanted. I didn’t bait the hook with strawberries and cream. Rather, I dangled a worm or a grasshopper in front of the fish and said: “Wouldn’t you like to have that?”</p><p>Why not use the same common sense when fishing for people?</p><p>That is what Lloyd George, Great Britain’s Prime Minister during World War I, did. When someone asked him how he managed to stay in power after the other wartime leaders - Wilson, Orlando and Clemenceau - had been forgotten, he replied that if his staying on top might be attributed to any one thing, it would be to his having learned that it was necessary to bait the hook to suit the fish .</p><p>Why talk about what we want? That is childish. Absurd.</p><p>Of course, you are interested in what you want.</p><p>You are eternally interested in it. But no one else is. The rest of us are just like you: we are interested in what we want.So the only way cm earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it.</p><p>Remember that tomorrow when you are trying to get somebody to do something. If, for example, you don’t want your children to smoke, don’t preach at them, and don’t talk about what you want; but show them that cigarettes may keep them from making the basketball team or winning the hundred-yard dash.</p><p>This is a good thing to remember regardless of whether you are dealing with children or calves or chimpanzees.</p><p>For example: one day Ralph Waldo Emerson and his son tried to get a calf into the barn. But they made the common mistake of thinking only of what they wanted: Emerson pushed and his son pulled. But the calf was doing just what they were doing; he was thinking only of what he wanted; so he stiffened his legs and stubbornly refused to leave the pasture. The Irish housemaid saw their predicament. She couldn’t write essays and books; but, on this occasion at least, she had more horse sense, or calf sense, than Emerson had. She thought of what the calf wanted; so she put her maternal finger in the calf’s mouth and let the calf suck her finger as she gently led him into the barn.</p><p>Every act you have ever performed since the day you were born was performed because you wanted something.</p><p>How about the time you gave a large contribution to the Red Cross? Yes, that is no exception to the rule.</p><p>You gave the Red Cross the donation because you wanted to lend a helping hand; you wanted to do a beautiful, unselfish, divine act. &quot; Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.”</p><p>If you hadn’t wanted that feeling more than you wanted your money, you would not have made the contribution.</p><p>Of course, you might have made the contribution because you were ashamed to refuse or because a customer asked you to do it. But one thing is certain. You made the contribution because you wanted something.</p><p>Harry A, Overstreet in his illuminating book Influencing</p><p>Human Behavior said; “Action springs out of what we fundamentally desire . . . and the best piece of advice which can be given to would-be persuaders, whether in business, in the home, in the school, in politics, is: First, arouse in the other person an eager want.</p><p>He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way.”</p><p>Andrew Carnegie, the poverty-stricken Scotch lad who started to work at two cents an hour and finally gave away $365 million, learned early in life that the only way to influence people is to talk in terms of what the other person wants. He attended school only four years; yet he learned how to handle people.</p><p>To illustrate: His sister-in-law was worried sick over her two boys. They were at Yale, and they were so busy with their own affairs that they neglected to write home and paid no attention whatever to their mother’s frantic letters.</p><p>Then Carnegie offered to wager a hundred dollars that he could get an answer by return mail, without even asking for it. Someone called his bet; so he wrote his nephews a chatty letter, mentioning casually in a post-script that he was sending each one a five-dollar bill.</p><p>He neglected, however, to enclose the money.</p><p>Back came replies by return mail thanking “Dear</p><p>Uncle Andrew” for his kind note and-you can finish the sentence yourself.</p><p>Another example of persuading comes from Stan</p><p>Novak of Cleveland, Ohio, a participant in our course.</p><p>Stan came home from work one evening to find his youngest son, Tim, kicking and screaming on the living room floor. He was to start kindergarten the next day and was protesting that he would not go. Stan’s normal reaction would have been to banish the child to his room and tell him he’d just better make up his mind to go. He had no choice. But tonight, recognizing that this would not really help Tim start kindergarten in the best frame of mind, Stan sat down and thought, “If I were Tim, why would I be excited about going to kindergarten?” He and his wife made a list of all the fun things Tim would do such as finger painting, singing songs, making new friends. Then they put them into action. “We all started finger-painting on the kitchen table-my wife, Lil, my other son Bob, and myself, all having fun. Soon Tim was peeping around the corner. Next he was begging to participate.</p><p>‘Oh, no! You have to go to kindergarten first to learn how to finger-paint.’ With all the enthusiasm I could muster I went through the list talking in terms he could understand-telling him all the fun he would have in kindergarten. The next morning, I thought I was the first one up. I went downstairs and found Tim sitting sound asleep in the living room chair. ‘What are you doing here?’ I asked. ‘I’m waiting to go to kindergarten.</p><p>I don’t want to be late.’ The enthusiasm of our entire family had aroused in Tim an eager want that no amount of discussion or threat could have possibly accomplished.”</p><p>Tomorrow you may want to persuade somebody to do something. Before you speak, pause and ask yourself:</p><p>“How can I make this person want to do it?”</p><p>That question will stop us from rushing into a situation heedlessly, with futile chatter about our desires.</p><p>At one time I rented the grand ballroom of a certain</p><p>New York hotel for twenty nights in each season in order to hold a series of lectures.</p><p>At the beginning of one season, I was suddenly informed that I should have to pay almost three times as much rent as formerly. This news reached me after the tickets had been printed and distributed and all announcements had been made.</p><p>Naturally, I didn’t want to pay the increase, but what was the use of talking to the hotel about what I wanted?</p><p>They were interested only in what they wanted. So a couple of days later I went to see the manager.</p><p>&quot;I was a bit shocked when I got your letter,” I said,</p><p>“but I don’t blame you at all. If I had been in your position,</p><p>I should probably have written a similar letter myself.</p><p>Your duty as the manager of the hotel is to make all the profit possible. If you don’t do that, you will be fired and you ought to be fired. Now, let’s take a piece of paper and write down the advantages and the disadvantages that will accrue to you, if you insist on this increase in rent.”</p><p>Then I took a letterhead and ran a line through the center and headed one column “Advantages” and the other column “Disadvantages.”</p><p>I wrote down under the head “Advantages” these words: “Ballroom free.” Then I went on to say: “You will have the advantage of having the ballroom free to rent for dances and conventions. That is a big advantage, for affairs like that will pay you much more than you can get for a series of lectures. If I tie your ballroom up for twenty nights during the course of the season, it is sure to mean a loss of some very profitable business to you.</p><p>“Now, let’s ‘consider the disadvantages. First, instead of increasing your income from me, you are going to decrease it. In fact, you are going to wipe it out because</p><p>I cannot pay the rent you are asking. I shall be forced to hold these lectures at some other place.</p><p>“There’s another disadvantage to you also. These lectures attract crowds of educated and cultured people to your hotel. That is good advertising for you, isn’t it? In fact, if you spent five thousand dollars advertising in the newspapers, you couldn’t bring as many people to look at your hotel as I can bring by these lectures. That is worth a lot to a hotel, isn’t it?” </p><p>As I talked, I wrote these two “disadvantages” under the proper heading, and handed the sheet of paper to the manager, saying: &quot;I wish you would carefully consider both the advantages and disadvantages that are going to accrue to you and then give me your final decision.”</p><p>I received a letter the next day, informing me that my rent would be increased only 50 percent instead of 300 percent.</p><p>Mind you, I got this reduction without saying a word about what I wanted. I talked all the time about what the other person wanted and how he could get it.</p><p>Suppose I had done the human, natural thing; suppose</p><p>I had stormed into his office and said, “What do you mean by raising my rent three hundred percent when you know the tickets have been printed and the announcements made? Three hundred percent! Ridiculous!</p><p>Absurd! I won’t pay it!”</p><p>What would have happened then? An argument would have begun to steam and boil and sputter - and you know how arguments end. Even if I had convinced him that he was wrong, his pride would have made it difficult for him to back down and give in.</p><p>Here is one of the best bits of advice ever given about the fine art of human relationships. “If there is any one secret of success,” said Henry Ford, “it lies in the ability to get the other person’s point of view and see things from that person’s angle as well as from your own.”</p><p>That is so good, I want to repeat it:&quot;If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person&#x27;s point of view and see things from that person’s angle as well as from your own.”</p><p>That is so simple, so obvious, that anyone ought to see the truth of it at a glance; yet 90 percent of the people on this earth ignore it 90 percent of the time.</p><p>An example? Look at the letters that come across your desk tomorrow morning, and you will find that most of them violate this important canon of common sense.</p><p>Take this one, a letter written by the head of the radio department of an advertising agency with offices scattered across the continent. This letter was sent to the managers of local radio stations throughout the country.</p><p>(I have set down, in brackets, my reactions to each paragraph.)</p><p>Mr. John Blank,</p><p>Blankville,</p><p>Indiana</p><p>Dear Mr. Blank:</p><p>The ------ company desires to retain its position in advertising agency leadership in the radio field.</p><p>[Who cares what your company desires?

I come down to the office this morning worried, open my mail and here is some little whippersnapper off in New York yapping about what his company wants. Bah!

What effect did this letter have on the man to whom it was addressed? Read it and then I&#x27;ll tell you.</p><p>A. Zerega’s Sons, Inc.</p><p>28 Front St.</p><p>Brooklyn, N.Y. 11201</p><p>Attention: Mr. Edward Vermylen</p><p>Gentlemen:</p><p>The operations at our outbound-rail-receiving station are handicapped because a material percentage of the total business is delivered us in the late afternoon. This condition results in congestion, overtime on the part of our forces, delays to trucks, and in some cases delays to freight. On</p><p>November 10, we received from your company a lot of 510 pieces, which reached here at 4:20 P.M.</p><p>We solicit your cooperation toward overcoming the undesirable effects arising from late receipt of freight. May we ask that, on days on which you ship the volume which was received on the above date, effort be made either to get the truck here earlier or to deliver us part of the freight during the morning?</p><p>The advantage that would accrue to you under such an arrangement would be that of more expeditious discharge of your trucks and the assurance that your business would go forward on the date of its receipt.</p><p>Very truly yours,</p><p>J----- B ----- Supt.</p><p>After reading this letter, Mr. Vermylen, sales manager for A. Zerega’s Sons, Inc., sent it to me with the following comment:</p><p>This letter had the reverse effect from that which was intended. The letter begins by describing the Terminal’s difficulties, in which we are not interested, generally speaking.</p><p>Our cooperation is then requested without any thought as to whether it would inconvenience us, and then, finally, in the last paragraph, the fact is mentioned that if we do cooperate it will mean more expeditious discharge of our trucks with the assurance that our freight will go forward on the date of its receipt.</p><p>In other words, that in which we are most interested is mentioned last and the whole effect is one of raising a spirit of antagonism rather than of cooperation.</p><p>Let’s see if we can’t rewrite and improve this letter.</p><p>Let’s not waste any time talking about our problems. As</p><p>Henry Ford admonishes, let’s “get the other person’s point of view and see things from his or her angle, as well as from our own.”</p><p>Here is one way of revising the letter. It may not be the best way, but isn’t it an improvement?</p><p>Mr. Edward Vermylen</p><p>% A. Zerega’s Sons, Inc.</p><p>28 Front St.</p><p>Brooklyn, N.Y. 11201</p><p>Dear Mr. Vermylen:</p><p>Your company has been one of our good customers for fourteen years. Naturally, we are very grateful for your patronage and are eager to give you the speedy, efficient service you deserve. However, we regret to say that it isn’t possible for us to do that when your trucks bring us a large shipment late in the afternoon, as they did on November</p><ol start="10"><li>Why? Because many other customers make late afternoon deliveries also. Naturally, that causes congestion. That means your trucks are held up unavoidably at the pier and sometimes even your freight is delayed.</li></ol><p>That’s bad, but it can be avoided. If you make your deliveries at the pier in the morning when possible, your trucks will be able to keep moving, your freight will get immediate attention, and our workers will get home early at night to enjoy a dinner of the delicious macaroni and noodles that you manufacture.</p><p>Regardless of when your shipments arrive, we shall always cheerfully do all in our power to serve you promptly.</p><p>You are busy. Please don’t trouble to answer this note.</p><p>Yours truly,</p><p>J----- B-----, supt.</p><p>Barbara Anderson, who worked in a bank in New</p><p>York, desired to move to Phoenix, Arizona, because of the health of her son. Using the principles she had learned in our course, she wrote the following letter to twelve banks in Phoenix:</p><p>Dear Sir:</p><p>My ten years of bank experience should be of interest to a rapidly growing bank like yours.</p><p>In various capacities in bank operations with the Bankers</p><p>Trust Company in New York, leading to my present assignment as Branch Manager, I have acquired skills in all phases of banking including depositor relations, credits, loans and administration.</p><p>I will be relocating to Phoenix in May and I am sure I can contribute to your growth and profit. I will be in Phoenix the week of April 3 and would appreciate the opportunity to show you how I can help your bank meet its goals.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Barbara L. Anderson</p><p>Do you think Mrs. Anderson received any response from that letter? Eleven of the twelve banks invited her to be interviewed, and she had a choice of which bank’s offer to accept. Why? Mrs. Anderson did not state what she wanted, but wrote in the letter how she could help them, and focused on their wants, not her own.</p><p>Thousands of salespeople are pounding the pavements today, tired, discouraged and underpaid. Why?</p><p>Because they are always thinking only of what they want. They don’t realize that neither you nor I want to buy anything. If we did, we would go out and buy it. But both of us are eternally interested in solving our problems.</p><p>And if salespeople can show us how their services or merchandise will help us solve our problems, they won’t need to sell us. We’ll buy. And customers like to feel that they are buying - not being sold.</p><p>Yet many salespeople spend a lifetime in selling without seeing things from the customer’s angle. For example, for many years I lived in Forest Hills, a little community of private homes in the center of Greater</p><p>New York. One day as I was rushing to the station, I chanced to meet a real-estate operator who had bought and sold property in that area for many years. He knew</p><p>Forest Hills well, so I hurriedly asked him whether or not my stucco house was built with metal lath or hollow tile. He said he didn’t know and told me what I already knew - that I could find out by calling the Forest Hills</p><p>Garden Association. The following morning, I received a letter from him. Did he give me the information I wanted? He could have gotten it in sixty seconds by a telephone call. But he didn’t. He told me again that I could get it by telephoning, and then asked me to let him handle my insurance.</p><p>He was not interested in helping me. He was interested only in helping himself.</p><p>J. Howard Lucas of Birmingham, Alabama, tells how two salespeople from the same company handled the same type of situation, He reported:</p><p>“Several years ago I was on the management team of a small company. Headquartered near us was the district office of a large insurance company. Their agents were assigned territories, and our company was assigned to two agents, whom I shall refer to as Carl and John.</p><p>“One morning, Carl dropped by our office and casually mentioned that his company had just introduced a new life insurance policy for executives and thought we might be interested later on and he would get back to us when he had more information on it.</p><p>“The same day, John saw us on the sidewalk while returning from a coffee break, and he shouted: ‘Hey</p><p>Luke, hold up, I have some great news for you fellows.’</p><p>He hurried over and very excitedly told us about an executive life insurance policy his company had introduced that very day. (It was the same policy that Carl had casually mentioned.) He wanted us to have one of the first issued. He gave us a few important facts about the coverage and ended saying, ‘The policy is so new,</p><p>I’m going to have someone from the home office come out tomorrow and explain it. Now, in the meantime, let’s get the applications signed and on the way so he can have more information to work with.’ His enthusiasm aroused in us an eager want for this policy even though we still did not have details, When they were made available to us, they confirmed John’s initial understanding of the policy, and he not only sold each of us a policy, but later doubled our coverage.</p><p>“Carl could have had those sales, but he made no effort to arouse in us any desire for the policies.”</p><p>The world is full of people who are grabbing and self-seeking.</p><p>So the rare individual who unselfishly tries to serve others has an enormous advantage. He has little competition. Owen D. Young, a noted lawyer and one of</p><p>America’s great business leaders, once said: “People who can put themselves in the place of other people who can understand the workings of their minds, need never worry about what the future has in store for them.”</p><p>If out of reading this book you get just one thing - an increased tendency to think always in terms of other people’s point of view, and see things from their angle</p><ul><li>if you get that one thing out of this book, it may easily prove to be one of the building blocks of your career.</li></ul><p>Looking at the other person’s point of view and arousing in him an eager want for something is not to be construed as manipulating that person so that he will do something that is only for your benefit and his detriment.</p><p>Each party should gain from the negotiation. In the letters to Mr. Vermylen, both the sender and the receiver of the correspondence gained by implementing what was suggested. Both the bank and Mrs. Anderson won by her letter in that the bank obtained a valuable employee and Mrs. Anderson a suitable job. And in the example of John’s sale of insurance to Mr. Lucas, both gained through this transaction.</p><p>Another example in which everybody gains through this principle of arousing an eager want comes from Michael</p><p>E. Whidden of Warwick, Rhode Island, who is a territory salesman for the Shell Oil Company. Mike wanted to become the Number One salesperson in his district, but one service station was holding him back. It was run by an older man who could not be motivated to clean up his station. It was in such poor shape that sales were declining significantly.</p><p>This manager would not listen to any of Mike’s pleas to upgrade the station. After many exhortations and heart-to-heart talks - all of which had no impact - Mike decided to invite the manager to visit the newest Shell station in his territory.</p><p>The manager was so impressed by the facilities at the new station that when Mike visited him the next time, his station was cleaned up and had recorded a sales increase.</p><p>This enabled Mike to reach the Number One spot in his district. All his talking and discussion hadn’t helped, but by arousing an eager want in the manager, by showing him the modern station, he had accomplished his goal, and both the manager and Mike benefited.</p><p>Most people go through college and learn to read Virgil and master the mysteries of calculus without ever discovering how their own minds function. For instance:</p><p>I once gave a course in Effective Speaking for the young college graduates who were entering the employ of the</p><p>Carrier Corporation, the large air-conditioner manufacturer.</p><p>One of the participants wanted to persuade the others to play basketball in their free time, and this is about what he said: &quot;I want you to come out and play basketball. I like to play basketball, but the last few times I’ve been to the gymnasium there haven’t been enough people to get up a game. Two or three of us got to throwing the ball around the other night - and I got a black eye. I wish all of you would come down tomorrow night. I want to play basketball.”</p><p>Did he talk about anything you want? You don’t want to go to a gymnasium that no one else goes to, do you?</p><p>You don’t care about what he wants. You don’t want to get a black eye.</p><p>Could he have shown you how to get the things you want by using the gymnasium? Surely. More pep.</p><p>Keener edge to the appetite. Clearer brain. Fun. Games.</p><p>Basketball.</p><p>To repeat Professor Overstreet’s wise advice: First, arouse in the other person an eager want He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way.</p><p>One of the students in the author’s training course was worried about his little boy. The child was underweight and refused to eat properly. His parents used the usual method. They scolded and nagged. “Mother wants you to eat this and that.” &quot;Father wants you to grow up to be a big man.” </p><p>Did the boy pay any attention to these pleas? Just about as much as you pay to one fleck of sand on a sandy beach.</p><p>No one with a trace of horse sense would expect a child three years old to react to the viewpoint of a father thirty years old. Yet that was precisely what that father had expected. It was absurd. He finally saw that. So he said to himself: “What does that boy want? How can I tie up what I want to what he wants?”</p><p>It was easy for the father when he starting thinking about it. His boy had a tricycle that he loved to ride up and down the sidewalk in front of the house in Brooklyn.</p><p>A few doors down the street lived a bully - a bigger boy who would pull the little boy off his tricycle and ride it himself.</p><p>Naturally, the little boy would run screaming to his mother, and she would have to come out and take the bully off the tricycle and put her little boy on again, This happened almost every day.</p><p>What did the little boy want? It didn’t take a Sherlock</p><p>Holmes to answer that one. His pride, his anger, his desire for a feeling of importance - all the strongest emotions in his makeup - goaded him to get revenge, to smash the bully in the nose. And when his father explained that the boy would be able to wallop the daylights out of the bigger kid someday if he would only eat the things his mother wanted him to eat - when his father promised him that - there was no longer any problem of dietetics. That boy would have eaten spinach, sauerkraut, salt mackerel - anything in order to be big enough to whip the bully who had humiliated him so often.</p><p>After solving that problem, the parents tackled another:  the little boy had the unholy habit of wetting his bed.</p><p>He slept with his grandmother. In the morning, his grandmother would wake up and feel the sheet and say:</p><p>“Look, Johnny, what you did again last night.”</p><p>He would say: “No, I didn’t do it. You did it.”</p><p>Scolding, spanking, shaming him, reiterating that the parents didn’t want him to do it - none of these things kept the bed dry. So the parents asked: “How can we make this boy want to stop wetting his bed?”</p><p>What were his wants? First, he wanted to wear pajamas like Daddy instead of wearing a nightgown like</p><p>Grandmother. Grandmother was getting fed up with his nocturnal iniquities, so she gladly offered to buy him a pair of pajamas if he would reform. Second, he wanted a bed of his own. Grandma didn’t object.</p><p>His mother took him to a department store in Brooklyn, winked at the salesgirl, and said: “Here is a little gentleman who would like to do some shopping.”</p><p>The salesgirl made him feel important by saying:</p><p>“Young man, what can I show you?”</p><p>He stood a couple of inches taller and said: “I want to buy a bed for myself.”</p><p>When he was shown the one his mother wanted him to buy, she winked at the salesgirl and the boy was persuaded to buy it.</p><p>The bed was delivered the next day; and that night, when Father came home, the little boy ran to the door shouting: “Daddy! Daddy! Come upstairs and see my bed that I bought!”</p><p>The father, looking at the bed, obeyed Charles</p><p>Schwab’s injunction: he was “hearty in his approbation and lavish in his praise.”</p><p>“You are not going to wet this bed, are you?” the father said. &quot; Oh, no, no! I am not going to wet this bed.” The boy kept his promise, for his pride was involved. That was his bed. He and he alone had bought it. And he was wearing pajamas now like a little man. He wanted to act like a man. And he did.</p><p>Another father, K. T. Dutschmann, a telephone engineer, a student of this course, couldn’t get his three-year old daughter to eat breakfast food. The usual scolding, pleading, coaxing methods had all ended in futility. So the parents asked themselves: “How can we make her want to do it?”</p><p>The little girl loved to imitate her mother, to feel big and grown up; so one morning they put her on a chair and let her make the breakfast food. At just the psychological moment, Father drifted into the kitchen while she was stirring the cereal and she said: “Oh, look,</p><p>Daddy, I am making the cereal this morning.”</p><p>She ate two helpings of the cereal without any coaxing, because she was interested in it. She had achieved a feeling of importance; she had found in making the cereal an avenue of self-expression.</p><p>William Winter once remarked that &quot;self-expression is the dominant necessity of human nature.” Why can’t we adapt this same psychology to business dealings? When we have a brilliant idea, instead of making others think it is ours, why not let them cook and stir the idea themselves.</p><p>They will then regard it as their own; they will like it and maybe eat a couple of helpings of it.</p><p>Remember: “First, arouse in the other person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world with him.</p><p>He who cannot walks a lonely way.&quot;PRINCIPLE 3Arouse in the other person an eager want.In a NutshellFUNDAMENTAL TECHNIQUES INHANDLING PEOPLE</p><p>PRINCIPLE 1</p><p>Don’t criticize, condemn or complain.</p><p>PRINCIPLE 2</p><p>Give honest and sincere appreciation.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/xiong321123/personal-page/edit/main/docs/看书/How to win friends and influence people1.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_Z9Sw" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_vwxv"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/publicPage/docs/看书/How to win friends and influence people"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">How to win friends and influence people</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/publicPage/docs/看书/How to win friends and influence people2"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">How to win friends and influence people2</div></a></nav></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">文档</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/publicPage/docs/intro">介绍</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">交流</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/JcuDDQ2wpINoTdbsCT1kfQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">微信公众号<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/docusaurus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">个人微信号<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">更多</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/publicPage/blog">Blog</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2023 王雄.</div></div></div></footer></div>
