Life was hazardous and hard (at least, by today’s standards) but we eventually learnt to clear up land and grow our own food.</p><p>We learned to breed crops for high yield and also learned to domesticate animals. This was the agricultural age.</p><p>When people think of the men and women of these times, they think that these people were a different species – more ape-like, possessing lower intellect and less nuanced emotions than us.</p><p>This, of course, is not true. As you read this, I want you to remember something: the people who lived in these times were just as smart, just as clever, and had exactly the same emotional range we do today. They were modern homo sapiens in every way.</p><p>A great many of them were, in fact, cleverer than us and achieved a lot more with much less knowledge and technology. When people hypothesize that the pyramids were built by aliens and giants, they do not give the men who came before us enough credit.</p><p>Back to the agricultural age: Man settled down around cultivable land and formed society. This is when people started to specialize. Instead of everyone being a hunter gatherer, there were farmers, herders, teachers, healers, potters, etc.</p><p>This went on for a long time and the world didn’t change much for millennia. You could go forward a thousand years during this era and things would pretty much be the same. The son lived the same life as his father, who lived the same life as his father, and so on - and this went on for hundreds if not thousands of generations.</p><p>Remember that these men were just like you - just as smart, clever, and with the same emotional range. They just hadn’t figured out how to create modern technology.</p><p><strong>8</strong></p><p>They had no idea about the vastness of the world and an individual person didn’t have much power or influence unless they were kings.</p><p>The options the average non-noble person had in his life were very limited</p><p>-<!-- --> you could either till the land, provide some sort of service, or fight in the king’s army. The labor was not scalable, and even if you were the best and brightest - there was limited social and economic mobility.</p><p>Then came the industrial age. It would be fair to say that everything changed.</p><p>Using machines, one man could do the work of a dozen (if not a hundred or a thousand) and this brought the world untold amounts of wealth and prosperity.</p><p>Unlike the bygone days where everyone was a small enterprise tilling the land or selling some service or handmade product, now men would work in factories for a wage and make a pretty good income.</p><p>If you were the best and brightest, you could be an inventor and become rich from your own business. You no longer had to be an born in an aristocratic family to be rich - you just needed to be smart, invent something useful, and find a financier to set up a factory and hire a bunch of men.</p><p>Business became scalable. Instead of making one pot, you can now manufacture thousands of pots using machines and sell them using distributors. Instead of painstakingly copying a book by hand, you now had the printing press that will print you as many copies as you can sell.</p><p>New products arose, and prices of things went down over time. Everything was in flux. Men lived much better than their fathers and grandfathers as technology kept improving rapidly.</p><p>Tractors became better, harvesters showed up in the market, the clothes were better, the work was different, factories became more and more efficient… in short, all the machines got better, and human life with it.</p><p>Things were so different that a producer from the agricultural age could not make do after the industrial age took hold. This is very different from the agricultural age itself where you could go a thousand years and everything is pretty much the same. This is for a few reasons: By this time, he could no longer just clear up some forest land and become a farmer. That era was long gone and all the real estate in the world was controlled by some government or the other.</p><p>The work of an artisan like making and selling pots or sewing clothes had been rendered economically uncompetitive by machines.</p><p><strong>9</strong></p><p>Outside of joining the standing army, a man pretty much had two choices: he could either start a business or he could work for a wage.</p><p>Businesses are of two types:</p><p>• Non-scalable business, like a doctor’s or a lawyer’s practice. This typically involves selling time for money. It’s better than working for a wage, but you’re not getting rich. There’s a limited number of customers you can serve because it is a localized and personalized service.</p><p>• Scalable business. This typically involves a standardized product being produced at large scale and sold to large numbers of people.</p><p>Hours worked is not directly correlated with income and the people who found a way to scale made untold amounts of money.</p><p>An example of a scalable business is the manufacture of the monitor you’re reading this on. Some company manufactures it in large numbers and sells it all over the world. The guy who owns that company doesn’t spend his time selling individual units. His work is pretty much the same whether he sells a million units or two million units.</p><p>During the industrial age, it was still quite difficult to start a scalable business - even if you had a great product or idea. This was because of two key constraints: capital and labor.</p><p>Capital: Setting up a factory costs, hiring a lot of people, setting up a supply chain, and spending on advertising to educate the market about your product costs a lot of money. It can be a herculean task to just find the money to get started! You might need to sell a large percentage of your business before you’ve even begun, and it is unlikely that you would find the funds you need even if you were willing to do so.</p><p>Labor: Skilled labor is always in short supply, and even with unskilled labor you have to deal with egos and expectations. You have to manage people, or you will have strikes, theft, and intentional property damage.</p><p>It was back in the industrial age that the then richest man in the world John D. Rockefeller famously said that the ability to deal with people is as purchasable a commodity as sugar or coffee and I will pay more for that ability than for any other under the sun.</p><p>These were the issues that plagued entrepreneurs from back in the day, and the large needs of capital prevented most of them from ever getting to try their ideas out.</p><p>Today, we are in the digital age. The invention of the globally connected network of computers (i.e. internet) changed everything.</p><p><strong>10</strong></p><p>Instead of needing to spend millions of dollars (dozens of bitcoin in today’s money) to start a factory to produce physical goods, you can produce digital goods (software, podcasts, ebooks, graphics, courses, etc.) for essentially zero marginal cost i.e. you make it once and replication is free.</p><p>Instead of needing to hire thousands of workers, paying them, and dealing with strikes, complaints, and management hassles, you can now use software to do the same work cheaply, efficiently, and with no errors.</p><p>In the digital age, there are no barriers to entry. A large amount of capital isn’t required - websites, domains, digital order fulfillment, social media etc. are all either free or cheap (much cheaper than the computer you’re reading this from), and you don’t need a lot of human labor because of software.</p><p>This is the age of entrepreneurship where anyone who wants to create something can do so.</p><p>If you want to be an entrepreneur, this is the best time in history to do it!</p><p>There are no excuses, no barriers, and little risk.</p><p>That being said, it is useful to have a manual from someone who has walked the walk before.</p><p>Something that will teach you the fundamentals, give you examples and success stories, and dissect other successful online businesses down so you can see how things work from your very eyes.</p><p>When my friend Wisdom Theory sent me the previous book 100 Mental Models, I instantly knew he had a knack for breaking down complex ideas and presenting them in an easy and practical way.</p><p>This is his breakdown of internet based businesses. If you want to start one and achieve freedom from a job, location independence, and of course, lots of money - you’re at the right place.</p><p>I wish I had this book when I started. I would have made fewer mistakes on the way and done a lot of right things much earlier. I’d have sped up my entrepreneurial journey significantly.</p><p>You have this book.</p><p>You can speak English.</p><p>You have an internet connection.</p><p>And more importantly, you’re willing to learn new things (the fact that you’re reading this book is proof).</p><p>You have what it takes.</p><p><strong>11</strong></p><p>We’ll see you on the other side.</p><p>With best wishes,</p><p><strong>- Harsh Strongman</strong></p><p><strong>Author of LifeMathMoney.com</strong></p><p><strong>The #1 Self-Improvement Resource on the Internet</strong></p><p><strong>12</strong></p><p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p><p><strong>You have to ignore history to be pessimistic about the future.</strong></p><p><strong>— Ron Davison</strong></p><p>Can you imagine living wherever you want and working on what you are passionate about. Without bosses, offices, or schedules. Focused on your mission and impacting the world in a direct way?</p><p>This situation which would sound illusory a few years ago is today a growing reality. Every day more people live like this, and far from being a fad, it is the new economy that many are not yet aware of.</p><p>These new entrepreneurs are creating a new future. They are taking control of their lives and work, living by their own standards, and are making a personal impact on the world.</p><p>This manual will make you one of them.</p><p>The Internet has brought about a paradigm shift when it comes to work.</p><p>The physical and emotional needs have been covered and the search of the human being at this point of development must be to find meaning -</p><p>a sense to live by. Build your mission.</p><p>Other courses may teach you specific skills such as digital marketing or specific business models such as writing a book, creating a podcast, or an online store. These are valid and even necessary knowledge, but they are secondary.</p><p>There are many who, putting the cart before the horse, go ahead and create an online store, and when in a few months they have hardly sold any products, they feel unmotivated. They abandon the venture, thinking that entrepreneurship is not for them. They never realize that the only reason that moved them was to sell - it was money. Money is a by-product of the value you give to society and the number of people whose lives you improve. The best way to give value to society is by creating something that in your deepest being you believe they need - that it should be your mission to give it to the world.</p><p>The world we live in is a efficient and competitive place, for which you need to have a mission - a strong, personal, and robust purpose that allows you to support the effort of creating a business.</p><p><strong>13</strong></p><p>That is why the main task of this manual is that you find your personal mission on top of which you will define your online business.</p><p>This manual is divided into 3 large blocks:</p><p>• The first part explains why the internet has changed the world, and how it has brought the economy into an era of entrepreneurship. It will also explain how you can benefit from it.</p><p>• The second part refers to you. It contains two sections. In the first one you will get to know yourself - through several steps you will be able to know your mission and purpose in life. In the second section you will build the skills necessary in any business.</p><p>• The third part is dedicated to the creation of your business based on what you have learned in the first two parts, focusing on your purpose.</p><p>Additionally, this manual includes a section where we analyze 10 case studies of very different people and businesses - all of them successful.</p><p>This will make us aware of all the different forms our business can take.</p><p>Finally, you will find some conclusions that summarize what has been discussed in the book.</p><p><strong>14</strong></p><p><strong>INTERNET</strong></p><p><strong>I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve even seen the tip of the iceberg.</strong></p><p><strong>— David Bowie about the internet, 1999</strong></p><p>This manual is based on the idea that the Internet has given rise to a new economy based on entrepreneurship which is as different from the information economy as this was from the industrial economy before it, or as the industrial economy was from the agricultural economy.</p><p>Economy shapes the world and the life of each person. Since medieval times, western society has been defined by agricultural, industrial, and information economies. The emerging entrepreneurial economy is changing our definition of business and thus our way of living.</p><p>The Information Age was based on the importance of information as a pillar of progress. The Internet has ended this era. Today, information is omnipresent - it is a commodity. Progress is not based on it, this limit has been exceeded. In fact, in today&#x27;s age, the problem with information is not its scarcity, but its abundance.</p><p>The invention of agriculture reduced the time and energy spent on securing food. This left us with more free time, which led to new ideas and progress. In the same way, the Internet has democratized information, leaving us more time to generate new ideas that accelerate progress.</p><p>This has shifted the pillars of progress. In the age of information, knowledge was valued because it was not so widely available. Society rewarded people who had great knowledge, who came from important universities, had expensive MBAs in exclusive business schools, spoke several languages, had great experience, etc - all the way up to the CEO, who was the epitome of economic and social success.</p><p>This is no longer the case.</p><p>Although the economy continues to value these profiles, an emerging economy is arising. Successful YouTubers, influencers, writers, or podcast authors have more power, more influence, more money, more freedom, and most importantly, are more aligned with their mission than most CEOs.</p><p><strong>15</strong></p><p>![Image 2]<!-- -->(C:\Program Files\Typora\images\000019.jpg)</p><p>This is so because information is no longer the most valued asset by the economy or by society. The Internet fulfilled this need, and although society still values knowledge, the true value is in entrepreneurship.</p><p>Entrepreneurship gives us not only money and freedom but also meaning.</p><p>Viktor Frankl in his work Man&#x27;s Search for Meaning concluded that people needed a reason to live. This idea is also defended by Jordan Peterson.

Davison&#x27;s main idea is that limits define the economic system and changes arise when that limit is exceeded. The limit being exceeded causes a change in the dominant institution of the economy.</p><p><strong>The Fourth Economy - Economic Transitions In The Last 1.000 Years</strong> <strong>Source: The Fourth Economy, Ron Davison</strong></p><p><strong>16</strong></p><p>![Image 3]<!-- -->(C:\Program Files\Typora\images\000006.jpg)</p><p>Thus, for example, in the industrial economy the dominant institution was the banks, since access to capital was the limit that defined the economy. As banks streamlined capital creation, the boundary shifted to knowledge workers. Banks had become effective at producing capital, but the economy did not have enough knowledge workers to grow. Because the corporation produces knowledge workers more effectively than the banks, power shifted from banks to corporations. Banks still hold power but lost it, relatively, to the corporations.</p><p>Currently, the limit of knowledge has been exceeded due to easy access to information. Today, the new limit is entrepreneurship which posits the individual and no longer the corporation as the dominant institution.</p><p><strong>Right now, becoming an entrepreneur is like becoming a knowledge worker in 1900.

Anderson elaborated on the concept in his book <em>The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business Is</em> <em>Selling Less of More</em>. The term <em>long tail</em> is commonly used in statistics in relation to wealth distributions or vocabulary usage.</p><p>&quot;The Long Tail theory holds that our culture and economy is shifting from being focused on a small number of &#x27;hits&#x27; (widely accepted products and markets) at the top of the demand curve, to being dedicated to a huge number of specialized niches in the tail,&quot; explains Chris Anderson.</p><p>The long tail is a business model that refutes traditional models in which it was taught that the products that should be sold are those with the highest turnover.</p><p><strong>The Long Tail</strong></p><p><strong>19</strong></p><p>Anderson continues: &quot;By lowering production and distribution costs, especially online, there is now less need to cram products and consumers into one-size-fits-all containers. In an era without the physical space limitations of shelf space and other bottlenecks of distribution, products and services with a very defined target can be as economically attractive as those for popular consumption.&quot;</p><p>The Internet has converted the economy from mass consumption to niche consumption. The cost of storing and distributing digital content is close to zero, which allows for increased product offerings. The one-size-fits-all markets of before have fragmented into niches, giving way to the opportunity to live from our niche, from our mission.</p><p><strong>Whatever niche obsession you have, the internet allows you to scale.</strong></p><p><strong>— Naval Ravikant</strong></p><p>In the case studies section of this book, we will see different niche obsessions and see to what extent interests appreciated by a minority are turning into successful Internet businesses. By being able to build and distribute at a marginal cost close to zero, you do not need millions of customers to make a great income - the turning point is as close as you find a few thousand from all over the world. You just need to provide value.</p><p>There are almost 8 billion people in the world - more than half have access to the Internet, a figure that increases every year. Finding a few thousand people who are interested in what you do, whom you can impact in a positive way, has never been easier.</p><p><strong>20</strong></p><p>![Image 5]<!-- -->(C:\Program Files\Typora\images\000020.jpg)</p><p><strong>Cut Out The Middleman</strong></p><p><strong>If no one seems to understand.</strong></p><p><strong>Start your own revolution and cut out the middleman</strong></p><p><strong>- Billy Bragg</strong></p><p>Disintermediation is the process by which intermediary agents are removed from a transaction. Disintermediation occurs when a buyer can buy or make a transaction directly, without resorting to an intermediary that connects him with the manufacturer or provider of the service.</p><p><strong>Disintermediation</strong></p><p>Disintermediation has been around for decades, but technology has taken it to a different level.</p><p>Technically, it means eliminating all those elements that work with producers in delivering their products to end-users. Travel agents, stockbrokers, retailers and even distributors are eliminated by manufacturers. With the help of technological advances, growers and manufacturers have the freedom to reach customers by relying on minimal or no intermediaries.</p><p>Information Technology has forever changed the traditional supply chain.</p><p>Disintermediation has been around for decades, but technology has taken it to a different level. Some of the largest companies are the product of disintermediation:</p><p>Amazon eliminated wholesale and retail stores</p><p>− Uber eliminated taxi drivers</p><p>− YouTube replaced TV channels</p><p>− AirBnb is replacing hotels and hostels</p><p>− Facebook eliminated the Media</p><p>− Podcasts eliminated radios</p><p><strong>21</strong></p><p>− Twitter is quickly becoming the most popular source of news</p><p>− Instagram eliminated trending media</p><p>− eBay eliminated second-hand stores</p><p>The benefits are as follows:</p><p>− The opportunity is to deliver a product or service to consumers by increasing perceived value by changing the fundamental way it is delivered. Each intermediary will add a margin to the product or service and therefore the final cost to the consumer may have various levels of profit and cost associated with the value chain, for example distribution, storage, and transportation costs.</p><p>− Eliminating the middlemen reduces the number of costs and often the time to reach the consumer. The digitization of products has led to the transformation of physical products into zeros and ones.</p><p>Books, music and even money are now digitized and therefore easy to distribute.</p><p>− Digital products can be delivered over the Internet as a package or as a single unit (known as unbundling). Music tracks, videos, software, newspapers, and books are now easily distributed across multiple channels and viewable on a variety of devices.</p><p>The Internet has made the means of distribution available to everyone.</p><p>A couple of decades ago, if you wanted to publish a book, you needed a publisher that would accept your writing; if you wanted to publish an album you needed a company that would trust in you and publish your album; if you wanted to do a radio or TV program you had to be hired by a media network, etc.</p><p>Today you can do all this without anyone&#x27;s permission.</p><p>Do you want to publish a book or an album?

Improve the lives of millions of people.</p><p>Money is a by-product of the value you bring to society. The greatest companies in history have been those that have improved the lives of millions of people - from US Steel, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph or Standard Oil a century ago, to Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Alphabet and Facebook today.</p><p><strong>100 Years Of America’s Top 10 Companies</strong></p><p><strong>Source: Howmuch and Forbes</strong></p><p><strong>23</strong></p><p>For this reason, it is no coincidence that today the 5 largest companies in the United States are based on the Internet, since it allows them to leverage the advantages it provides to maximize like no other tool Humans have invented in all of History. The cost of storing and distributing a digital product tends marginally to zero. Microsoft has many of the best engineers in the world, working on a product like Office that costs them millions of dollars to build, but once built, the cost of replicating and distributing it is practically zero. Build once and sell millions, that is the great lever that the Internet provides.</p><p>An everyday example could be a personal trainer at your neighborhood gym, let&#x27;s call him John. He teaches 25 classes a week, at a cost of $75/hour. Which brings him an income of $1,875/week, that is, $7,500/month. John wants to increase his income, but he only sees two ways, either he increases the price of his classes, or he gives more classes.</p><p>Considering that the price would be limited by the competition and the number of classes that he can offer is limited to the hours of the day minus his resting hours. Given these factors, even if he is a great coach, would limit his income. That is, it is a not very scalable system.</p><p>Thinking about how he could make his business more scalable, he considers opening a gym so that he can offer more services. But, going this way, his expenses would increase, he would have to pay the rent of the premises, the necessary refurbishment, buy or rent the equipment, and the personnel salaries.</p><p>John, intending to avoid such a large outlay, thinks of another option.</p><p>With the Internet he could give online classes. Or even better, he could create a monthly training service, with a daily class, where subscribers pay a monthly fee.</p><p>He would generate demand by offering nutrition and training advice on YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter.</p><p>He would create a podcast where he would talk about training and nutrition.</p><p>And he would offer his courses online and sell them through Shopify.</p><p>Obviously, this would be a tremendous effort. But the upfront cost is very low. And he could also build it progressively, even combining it with his current personal training until the business takes off.</p><p>Since the cost of a new customer signing up for his monthly service is practically zero, John sets a lower monthly rate than that of his personal training classes at $25/month.</p><p><strong>24</strong></p><p>Before, a customer had to pay $75 for a class, which was not a bad price considering they were personal classes, now for a price 3 times cheaper he will have access to 30 online classes.</p><p>It takes him a few months to reach 300 subscribers, which is the same $7,500 monthly income he was getting from his old business. Not bad, but the business continues to grow. In a few years, he has 5,000</p><p>subscribers, which brings him $125,000 a month, an unthinkable figure in his old business.</p><p>This story is just an example. The more operational leverage you use, higher the possibility you have of offering value to more people.</p><p>Historically, the levers of business have been personal property, people, and money, all of which have limited scalability, represent a significant cost and you need permission to use them. The Internet changes everything, the scalability is unlimited, the cost is minimal, and you do not need permission to use it.</p><p><strong>25</strong></p><p>![Image 7]<!-- -->(C:\Program Files\Typora\images\000048.jpg)</p><p><strong>The Era of Entrepreneurship</strong></p><p><strong>It’s time to build.</strong></p><p><strong>- Marc Andreessen</strong></p><p>We live in the best moment in history. People may have been able to say this of any past era, but this time is different, we are reaching a new threshold.</p><p>When Abraham Maslow set to define human needs, he put personal development at the top of the list. According to his famous pyramid of needs, only after having the needs of survival covered, could we aspire to higher levels, with self-actualization at the top.</p><p><strong>Learning Pyramid</strong></p><p>Although people did manage to reach self-actualization in the past, it was no easy accomplishment, and it was much less common in previous economic systems. The philosophers, kings, businessmen, scientists, and artists of the past have been the people who have made human progress evolve the most, their ultimate focus was always transcending.</p><p>Although it is true that they were mostly people who had a relatively settled life.</p><p>Progress has allowed human being to pursue higher needs.

The first objective of work is survival, and when this is covered, work covers other needs, more psychological and less physical.

Frankl:</p><p><strong>Life is not primarily a quest for pleasure, as Freud believed, or a quest for power, as Alfred Adler</strong> <strong>taught, but a quest for meaning.</strong></p><p><strong>- Viktor E.

Peterson</strong></p><p><strong>27</strong></p><p>The liberation of the production and distribution systems to the public represents a turning point without parallel in human history. Taking the meaning that work brings to our lives to a level never imagined in our past. Once the physiological and affective needs have been overcome, the human being enters to cover his highest aspiration, that of self-realization and transcendence.</p><p>It will not mean that each person&#x27;s life is more comfortable, but it will give us the strength to endure the obstacles and difficulties we may encounter.</p><p><strong>28</strong></p><p><strong>YOU</strong></p><p><strong>Escape competition through authenticity.</strong></p><p><strong>- Naval Ravikant</strong></p><p>Now that we have defined the new economy, we will focus on how to reinvent yourself to fit into it. In this section you will get to know yourself better, you will identify your strengths and your improvement points to build your mission.</p><p>The idea of this manual is that you are the engine of your business. That you no longer depend on a corporation, that you cannot hide in it, or support on it, because you are the corporation. You will have to know yourself, improve yourself and expose yourself, that is the price of building your mission.</p><p>We will ask open questions for you to answer openly. Writing is one of the best ways to get to know oneself, because it forces us to organize our thoughts. Do not worry if at first the ideas are not fully defined, or are scattered, the important thing is that they arise and flow. The first thing is that you begin to get to know yourself to guide us towards where we want to go, and then outline the strategy that will continue to be adjusted iteratively with your clients.</p><p>In the new era you are the brand, you are the business. Everything you do will define your business. The homogenization that was required in jobs, where there was a code of conduct defined in a company policy, where the standardization of workers was sought with the aim that the company knew what to expect from them, reducing uncertainty. In this new era, this will be instead the main aspect to avoid.</p><p>Your differentiation, what makes you unique, will be the engine of your business. Forget the dichotomy of better and worse, even good, and bad.</p><p>Within the limits of what is ethically correct, a point that we will see later, nothing is good or bad. We will change our perspective to unique, singular, personal, and from there we will connect with the people who contribute to them, try to be like them and fit this personality.</p><p><strong>The most difficult thing in life is to know yourself.</strong></p><p><strong>- Thales de Miletus</strong></p><p><strong>29</strong></p><p>Just as any other living being, you will evolve throughout your life, in the same way that your business will evolve. We must start by getting to know ourselves, find our uniqueness, which will be our advantages compared to the competition.</p><p>What makes you unique is your opportunity. Find it and enhance it.</p><p>In the next section we will carry out various exercises that will help us towards these goals, which together with what we believe the world needs, will give us a mental map of who we are and where we should go.</p><p>This map will be in constant evolution since both us and the world evolve, but it will be very useful for us to define our path.</p><p>In succeeding sections, once the mental map has been defined, we will try to improve ourselves, optimizing our skills to create a successful business.</p><p><strong>30</strong></p><p><strong>Know Yourself</strong></p><p><strong>Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom.</strong></p><p><strong>— Aristotle</strong></p><p>Since we were children, we have been educated to obey, to do what we are expected to do, we have been conditioned to behave like the rest. Any singularity has been pointed out, criticized, and buried deep in our minds.</p><p>Organizations, from schools to companies, punish what is different since it implies uncertainty for them. If you like to dress in colorful shirts, wear a bow tie, talk about birds, or spend your money collecting Persian coins, you should wear it almost secretly, because this separates you from the group.</p><p>As social animals that we are, our genes are designed to follow the herd, to be just like them. The solitary ape in prehistoric Africa did not have many options for survival, which is why genes have rewarded us for adapting to our environment.</p><p>But in the new era all this has changed. Uniqueness is rewarded. Your personality is your brand. It will not please everyone, nor should it, a group of people with whom you connect will be enough. The more defined and personal your message is, the more recognizable you will be to the public. If you dilute it excessively to reach more audiences, it will be lost, and you will not add value.</p><p>Nobody can compete with Elon Musk, Donald Trump, or Warren Buffett in being themselves. Their uniqueness is what has allowed them to create an empire.</p><p>Thus, in large corporations the personalities of the employees are identical, while in a personal online business, being different is rewarded.</p><p>You just have to think of any youtuber or writer, they are unique, and their brand and their business are built on these differences.</p><p>Nobody can compete with you in being you.</p><p>From school they have taught us to obey, they have told us what we should think. Even in politics our family has guided us where we should be heading. All this has distanced us from who we really are, being strangers to ourselves.</p><p><strong>31</strong></p><p>For this reason, the first point will be to get to know ourselves. Search in our mind what our interests are, what we like, what we want to do. This is a task that will take a lifetime.</p><p>The best way to get to know ourselves is by writing. Writing forces us to order our ideas and capture them in a legible way. In fact, it is one of the best habits that can be acquired, since it will help us understand ourselves better, focus on what we are looking for, plan our lives, etc.</p><p>Next, we will try to create a mental map of who we are and how we could fit it into what the world needs.</p><p>For this, several questions are attached. Take your time, respond in as deep a way as you can. There is no time limit in answering them, it is even recommended that you do and review them on different days, since your daily mood will affect your answers.</p><p>Write freely and don&#x27;t worry if few ideas come out at first, as we have said, getting to know yourself is a lifelong task, and the sooner you start, the better you&#x27;ll get to know yourself.</p><p>Dedicate time and tranquility, in a place without distractions, to answer the following sections.</p><p><strong>32</strong></p><p>![Image 9]<!-- -->(C:\Program Files\Typora\images\000021.png)</p><p><strong>What do you love?</strong></p><p><strong>Skills are cheap.

Bethel, Maine</strong></p><p>The first section that we will see within this part is the mentality. Our beliefs define our actions.</p><p>In the following sections we will address the following recommendation: <strong>Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics, and computers.</strong></p><p><strong>- Naval Ravikant</strong></p><p>They are the pillars on which knowledge is based to create a business.</p><p><strong>49</strong></p><p><strong>Mentality</strong></p><p><strong>All persons ought to endeavor to follow what is right, and not what is established.</strong></p><p><strong>— Aristotle</strong></p><p>You have to adapt your mindset to the new world you live in.</p><p>The success that the media sells us is the success of society, not yours.</p><p>A nice car, a great house and a good job is the definition of success in today&#x27;s society. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that as long as that is what you really want.</p><p>Although this success meets several of the levels of needs defined by Maslow, only rarely does it meet the higher goal of self-development and transcendence. And that is why there are few people who have aligned their mission with that of their job.</p><p>Human beings are entrepreneurs by nature. It is in our genes. During most of our past as a species, no one prepared our food, nor assured us that we would survive another day. You had to take risks, hunt, and fight against all kinds of uncertainties. The welfare state and the industrial educational system have made us trade freedom for security, and what is worse, mission for conformity. Society in general and the educational system in particular guide us to be good employees, to rent our time for the highest amount per hour that we can get, but this is limited by the hours of the day, which will limit our impact on society, to the number of people to whom add value and therefore the wealth that we can generate.</p><p>Mindset is more important than skills. Your beliefs about how the world works will determine your actions, and your actions will determine your results.</p><p>This new economy forces us to rethink the following points.</p><p><strong>SUCCESS</strong></p><p><strong>Stop chasing the money and start chasing the passion.</strong></p><p><strong>- Tony Hsieh</strong></p><p>The system sells us its own definition of success and failure, in order to keep the system running.</p><p><strong>50</strong></p><p>Success is being a boss in some multinational, with high status, working 16 hours a day, not seeing your children, having a big salary, a BMW, and an attic. The problem is that when you achieve this you don’t feel any happier, you actually feel unhappy.</p><p>You are biologically wired to seek freedom and contribution to your environment. The industrial and knowledge society limited these values, but the era of entrepreneurship puts them where they were always meant to be.</p><p>As for failure, society tells us that failures are small mistakes. Society does not want you to get off the marked path, therefore it punishes the slightest error.</p><p>But due to the infinite options that the economy of entrepreneurship offers us through the internet at a very low cost, trying and not succeeding is not a failure, on the contrary, it will provide knowledge that an employee would never do. The Internet works like a huge radio transmitter, you broadcast small signals and on whichever frequency you receive a response, double your efforts towards that. The only real failure is not taking advantage of these enormous opportunities and living your whole life within the rules of an outdated economy that does not allow you to fulfill your mission.</p><p>The second type of failure comes from testing your ideas. When it happens, the impact on your reputation is far less than the value of learning. Failure teaches you much more than success. Succeeding on the first try can be a curse in disguise. You do not learn enough, and you think you are infallible, increasing future risk.</p><p><strong>RISK &amp; REWARD</strong></p><p><strong>Security is mostly a superstition. Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.</strong></p><p><strong>- Helen Keller</strong></p><p>We are wired to live in an environment that ceased to exist thousands of years ago. Our genes are designed to minimize risk because risk meant death.</p><p>Because progress has been so much faster than biological evolution, these genes are still in us, while today&#x27;s environment is vastly safer than that of our ancestors.</p><p>This situation leads us to instinctively seek security and minimize risk at all costs, even if this means not maximizing the expected value of our lives.</p><p><strong>51</strong></p><p>![Image 16]<!-- -->(C:\Program Files\Typora\images\000037.png)</p><p>The worst thing that can happen to you on your deathbed is that you regret that you didn&#x27;t try at the time of greatest possibility in History.</p><p>While risk is a critical part of decision-making and any move that puts us out of the game should always be eliminated, we should focus on maximizing the expected value of our lives, while minimizing the regret of the decisions we take.</p><p>Thus, we would have a map for decision making:</p><ol><li>Eliminate options that leave us out of the game</li><li>Maximize the expected value of our life</li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-minimize-regret">3.

Leave the situation, change the situation, or accept</strong> <strong>it, all else is madness.</strong></p><p><strong>– Eckhart Tolle</strong></p><p>The paternalistic welfare state has infantilized society. Most people live as if they are the victims of their situation, as if what happens to them is not their fault but that of politicians, the economy, their boss, or their family. They blame others as an excuse for their failures.</p><p>You will never achieve anything on your own if you do not take responsibility for your life. Although life is uncertain, the moment you blame another person or situation for your future, you lose control over it.

This pillar is based, essentially, on the communication and publicity of the results obtained.</p><p>The second pillar is refutability, that is, that every scientific proposition must be susceptible to being falsified or refuted. This implies that experiments could be designed, which in the case of giving results different from those predicted, would negate the hypothesis being tested.</p><p>There really is no single scientific method.</p><p>The scientific method uses defining methods, classification methods, statistical methods, hypothetico-deductive methods, measurement procedures, etc.</p><p>It is a non-dogmatic method since it is based on laws deduced by humans and not on fixed principles. Its laws are always rejected if the facts contradict what those laws affirm. The validity of the scientific method is confirmed by the experience of its day-to-day application.</p><p>The scientific method, therefore, refers to the series of stages that must be followed, using reliable instruments, to obtain knowledge that is considered valid from a scientific point of view.</p><p>What this method aims to accomplish is minimizing the influence of scientists’ subjectivity in their work.</p><p><strong>Scientific Method</strong></p><p>Recommendations:</p><p>− Do not take anything for granted, have a beginner’s mind.</p><p>− Do not rely on popular beliefs or tradition, put everything to test, doubt everything from the basics.</p><p>− Have a logical and functional reasoning process.</p><p>− Base your research on evidence.</p><p>The main enemies of logical thinking are biases, which we will see in the psychology section, and logical fallacies, discussed below.</p><p><strong>55</strong></p><p><strong>LOGICAL FALLACIES</strong></p><p><strong>All the fallacies of human reason had to be exhausted before the light of a high truth could meet</strong> <strong>with ready acceptance.</strong></p><p><strong>— Friedrich Max Müller</strong></p><p>When challenging a claim, a fallacy is reasoning that is evaluated as logically incorrect and undermines the logical validity of the argument, permitting its recognition as unsound. Regardless of its apparent robustness, all registers and manners of speech can demonstrate fallacies.</p><p>Because of the variety of structure and application, fallacies are challenging to classify to satisfy all practitioners. Fallacies can be classified strictly by either their structure or content, such as classifying them as formal fallacies or informal fallacies, respectively. The classification of informal fallacies may be subdivided into categories such as linguistic, relevance through omission, relevance through intrusion, and relevance through presumption.</p><p>On the other hand, fallacies may be classified by the process by which they occur, such as material fallacies (content), verbal fallacies (linguistic), and again formal fallacies (error in inference). In turn, material fallacies may be placed into the more general category of informal fallacies, while formal fallacies may be clearly placed into the more precise category of logical (deductive) fallacies. Further, verbal fallacies may be placed into either informal or deductive classifications.</p><p>Compare equivocation, which describes the use of ambiguity with words or phrases, e. g. &quot;he is mad,&quot; which may refer to either him being angry or clinically insane, to the fallacy of composition, which is premise and inference-based ambiguity, e. g. &quot;this must be a good basketball team because each of its members is an outstanding player.&quot;</p><p>The conscious or habitual use of fallacies as rhetorical devices is prevalent in the desire to persuade when the focus is more on communication and eliciting common agreement rather than on the correctness of the reasoning. The effective use of a fallacy by an orator may be considered clever, but by the same token, the reasoning of that orator should be recognized as unsound, and thus the orator’s claim, supported by an unsound argument, will be regarded as unfounded and dismissed.</p><p>Next, we will see the 25 most common logical fallacies.</p><p><strong>56</strong></p><p>![Image 18]<!-- -->(C:\Program Files\Typora\images\000009.jpg)</p><p><strong>Logical Fallacies</strong></p><p><strong>AD HOMINEM</strong></p><p>Attacking a person or their character rather than making a claim based on reasoning.

This makes compound interest a great ally for long-term investment. Albert Einstein humorously said that compound interest is the most powerful force in the universe.</p><p>Let&#x27;s imagine an operation in which we invest 10,000 euros and each year they give us a 5% return on the capital invested. Since compound interest reinvests previously earned interest, unlike simple interest, the future profit is exponentially greater with</p><p>compound interest. The formula for</p><p>calculating compound interest is:</p><p><em>Compound Interest = Total amount</em></p><p><em>of Principal and Interest in future (or</em></p><p><em>Future</em></p><p><em>Value) minus</em></p><p><em>Principal</em></p><p><em>amount at present (or Present Value)</em></p><p>= <!-- -->[P (1 + <em>i</em>)n]<!-- --> – P</p><p>= P <!-- -->[(1 + <em>i</em>)n – 1]</p><p>Where: <em>P</em> = Principal, <em>i</em> = nominal annual interest rate in percentage terms, and <em>n</em> = number of compounding periods.</p><p>Take a three-year loan of $10,000 at an interest rate of 5% that compounds annually.

They do not know basic microeconomics.</strong></p><p><strong>— Jesse Jackson</strong></p><p>To create a successful business, you must know how the economy works.</p><p>There are two main branches to know the economy:</p><p>− <strong>Macroeconomics</strong>, which studies the behavior, structure, and capacity of aggregates at the national or regional level, such as economic growth, employment and unemployment rates, interest rates, inflation, among others.</p><p>− <strong>Microeconomics</strong>, which studies the actions of economic agents, such as consumers, companies, workers and investors, or the specific markets of one or another product. In other words, it is an approach at the individual levels, not the whole.</p><p>We will focus on studying microeconomics, since it is where we can influence.</p><p><strong>Most work in macroeconomics in the past 30 years has been useless at best and harmful at worst.</strong></p><p><strong>- Paul Krugman</strong></p><p>So, microeconomics is distinguished from macroeconomics, and its analysis focuses on the basic economic elements: goods, services, prices, markets, and economic agents.</p><p>The microeconomic approach can be structured in several sections, of which the following are the most important:</p><p><strong>CONSUMER THEORY</strong></p><p>This branch aims to understand the logic of consumption from the perspective of those who buy goods and services, that is, consumers: what choices do they make when choosing a product and why? What are their preferences and their logic when consuming? How could its consumption be predicted?</p><p><strong>69</strong></p><p><strong>DEMAND THEORY</strong></p><p>This section assumes the task of understanding the demand, that is, the desire to consume a specific good or service, or an entire sector of production, by consumers (some of whom are, in turn, time, producers).</p><p>This theory tries to approach the economy from the elements that provoke or alter the demand for a product.</p><p><strong>PRODUCER THEORY</strong></p><p>For this branch any organization that plans, communicates, and supervises production, that is, the conversion of productive factors into products that the consumer can buy, is a company, and therefore serves as a perspective to understand and try to predict. the economic flow in its entirety. How should a company manage its costs? How much should you produce and how can you maximize your profit?</p><p><strong>GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM THEORY</strong></p><p>This branch attempts to find a global explanation of the behavior of production and consumption, as well as price formation in an economy that has one or more markets. To do this, it goes from the particular to the general (bottom-up method), as opposed to macroeconomics (top-down).</p><p><strong>THEORY OF FINANCIAL ASSETS MARKETS</strong></p><p>Financial markets are a mechanism for the exchange of financial assets by economic agents, provided that the purpose of consumption is not the immediate use of the good, but the delay of consumption over time: the increase in capital, the transfer of risks, etc.</p><p>These subdisciplines cannot be considered completely separate fields of study, since the events of one affect the others, especially that of general equilibrium. The task of microeconomics is to offer possibilities for understanding the different market forces, such as mathematical models or other approaches that allow an approach to the economy from its constituent elements.</p><p>Finally, microeconomics aspires to model the market, which is equivalent to understanding its operational dynamics and proposing a structure, which can be of perfect competition (non-existent, economic agents in perfect balance and free competition) or imperfect (economic agents influence more or less on the workings of the market to tip the scales in your favor).</p><p><strong>70</strong></p><p><strong>LESSONS FROM MICROECONOMY</strong></p><p>Next, we will see the aspects related to microeconomics that we must consider when creating our business.</p><p><strong>NICHES/ POWER LAW</strong></p><p><strong>The Internet allows you to scale any niche obsession.</strong></p><p><strong>— Naval Ravikant</strong></p><p>The Internet allows you to find your audience.

Examples of agency are universal.</strong></p><p><strong>— Stephen Ross</strong></p><p>The agency problem consists, basically, in solving how the principal can ensure that the agent performs the action in an optimal way for his (the principal&#x27;s) interests, and not his own.</p><p>Think like an owner (principal), not an employee (agent).</p><p><strong>71</strong></p><p>![Image 22]<!-- -->(C:\Program Files\Typora\images\000010.jpg)</p><p>To avoid this problem is the reason why start-ups give part of the property to workers and thus also align incentives, which we will see in the next point.</p><p><strong>Principal Agent Problem</strong></p><p>A typical principal-agent relationship is that of the employer who hires a worker. And, as is known, there are many ways to mitigate or try to solve the agency problem. Ultimately, it is about looking for mechanisms so that the interests of the agent align with those of the principal, who is the one who ultimately chose him and pays him.</p><p>These agency costs usually occur due to information asymmetries, that is, when shareholders and managers do not have the same information on the value of tangible or financial assets, for example. This causes opportunistic behaviors to develop in the company, that managers seek to achieve their own interests, that conflicts arise over the distribution of free cash flow, that the so-called managerial myopia occurs and that the manager worries about keeping his job. All these situations generate agency costs.</p><p><strong>INCENTIVES</strong></p><p><strong>Show me the incentive and I’ll show you the outcome.</strong></p><p><strong>— Charlie Munger</strong></p><p><strong>72</strong></p><p>An incentive is a mechanism that relates a reward or punishment to a certain performance or behavior.</p><p>Incentives are what move people and companies. Align the incentives so that everyone goes in the same direction.</p><p>The objective of establishing an incentive is to induce a certain behavior.</p><p>It is assumed that the subject to which it is applied will act as a rational agent evaluating costs and benefits (homo economicus).</p><p>Therefore, the objective subject will consider optimal to develop the behavior that the designer of the incentive seeks, provided that said stimulus is well designed.</p><p>Thus, for example, if you want to motivate a worker to try harder, you can design an incentive that rewards their best effort. If it is a salesperson, a common incentive is to share in the highest sales through commissions.</p><p>There are at least four types of incentives:</p><p>− <strong>Monetary or financial incentives</strong>: They are the most widely used and surely one of the most effective. They can include a higher salary, payment of sales commissions, prices in money or stocks, etc.</p><p>− <strong>Moral incentives</strong>: They try to push people to do what is supposed to be right or good in a given society. Moral incentives are more complex to apply than monetary ones as values vary between different cultures. Furthermore, it is the person who ultimately decides whether or not she agrees with a certain moral convention.</p><p>− <strong>Natural incentives</strong>: They are based on human nature itself. Thus, for example, people in general are naturally curious so they can be motivated to do certain things in order to satisfy these natural needs.</p><p>− <strong>Coercive incentives</strong>: They are based on emphasizing the negative consequences or punishments that will not carry out a certain conduct or behavior. These are incentives that are based on the negative and therefore do not usually motivate subjects internally, and they only act out of fear.</p><p>Human action is often governed by incentives, many of which exist at the unconscious level. Every time a person performs a certain activity, they do so for a purpose that, in one way or another, will bring satisfaction.</p><p>This end is the incentive that mobilizes action.</p><p>The incentive can be the stimulation that is given to an individual for her good performance in any field (work, affective, etc.) with the intention of trying to maintain it. It is, therefore, a reward.</p><p><strong>73</strong></p><p>Our daily life usually presents a few incentives, of different magnitudes, that drive us to keep going. When a child strives to achieve good school performance, not only does she seek her own personal and intellectual development, but she is also likely to crave the reaction of her parents or guardians, the satisfaction and pride in their looks. Just as in operant conditioning, where behaviors are performed in order to either gain reinforcement or avoid punishment, incentive theory states that our actions are directed toward gaining rewards. Money is also an excellent example of an external reward that motivates behavior.</p><p><strong>SKIN IN THE GAME</strong></p><p><strong>Avoid taking advice from someone who gives advice for a living unless there is a penalty for their</strong> <strong>advice.</strong></p><p><strong>— Nassim Taleb</strong></p><p>Having <em>skin in the game</em> means taking a risk while participating in the achievement of a goal. In this sentence, the <em>skin</em> would be a metaphor of the person involved and the <em>game</em> of the actions in the achievement of the objective.</p><p>Used by Warren Buffett and popularized by Nassim Taleb in his 2017</p><p>book, <em>Skin in the game</em>, this expression is common in business, finance, and gaming, and is also used in politics.</p><p>If decision-makers have <em>skin in the game</em> in their decisions, we guarantee symmetry between actors, both benefits and risks are shared, information concealment is reduced and the transfer of problems to the future is discouraged, improving the resilience of the stakeholders.</p><p>In short, Taleb solves the principal-agent problem by <em>principalizing</em> the agent. Posed like this, it seems clear and bright. He tells us that all that breed of opinion makers, decision makers and dilettantes who dedicate themselves to making decisions that affect the lives of others without risking their own skin are the problem.</p><p>In fact, Taleb goes further with his proposal. For him, the heuristic of gambling one&#x27;s skin not only has a practical dimension (&quot;it is better for those who make decisions to gamble their hides&quot;) but it also has a moral dimension (&quot;only those who play their hides are entitled to make decisions for others&quot;).</p><p>Taleb summarizes this reflection in a blunt way: do not expose others to costs unless you are also, directly, or indirectly, exposed to them.</p><p><strong>74</strong></p><p><strong>NO SKIN IN THE GAME</strong></p><p><strong>SKIN IN THE GAME</strong></p><p><strong>SOUL IN THE GAME</strong></p><p><strong>Keeps upside,</strong></p><p><strong>Keeps his own downside,</strong></p><p><strong>Takes downside,</strong></p><p><strong>transfer downside to others</strong></p><p><strong>takes his own risk</strong></p><p><strong>gives upside to others</strong></p><p><strong>Bureaucrats</strong></p><p><strong>Citizens</strong></p><p><strong>Saints, warriors, soldiers</strong></p><p><strong>Consultants</strong></p><p><strong>Merchants, businessmen</strong></p><p><strong>Prophets</strong></p><p><strong>Businesses</strong></p><p><strong>Artisans</strong></p><p><strong>Artists</strong></p><p><strong>Corporate Executives</strong></p><p><strong>Entrepreneurs</strong></p><p><strong>Innovators</strong></p><p><strong>(with suit)</strong></p><p><strong>Theoreticians</strong></p><p><strong>Laboratory experimenters</strong></p><p><strong>-</strong></p><p><strong>Editors</strong></p><p><strong>Writers</strong></p><p><strong>Great writers</strong></p><p><strong>Journalists</strong></p><p><strong>Speculators</strong></p><p><strong>Rebels</strong></p><p><strong>Politicians</strong></p><p><strong>Activists</strong></p><p><strong>Revolutionaries</strong></p><p><strong>Bankers</strong></p><p><strong>Traders</strong></p><p><strong>-</strong></p><p><strong>PARETO PRINCIPLE</strong></p><p><strong>For many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.</strong></p><p><strong>— Vilfredo Pareto</strong></p><p>There is a minority of your actions that determine most of your results.</p><p>Detect them and potential them.</p><p>The Pareto Principle was described by the economist and sociologist Vilfredo Pareto, who specifies an unequal relationship between inputs and outputs.</p><p>The principle establishes that 20% of what is entered or invested is responsible for 80% of the results obtained. In other words, 80% of the consequences are derived from 20% of the causes; This is also known as the &quot;Pareto rule&quot; or the &quot;80/20 rule.&quot;</p><p>The name comes from Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, who noted the 80/20 connection while at the University of Lausanne in 1896, as <strong>75</strong></p><p>![Image 23]<!-- -->(C:\Program Files\Typora\images\000028.jpg)</p><p>![Image 24]<!-- -->(C:\Program Files\Typora\images\000015.png)</p><p>published in his first work, <em>Cours d’économie politique</em>.

For example:</p><p>− 20% of the consequences derive from 80% of the causes.</p><p>− 20% of workers produce 80% of the results.</p><p>− 20% of customers create 80% of revenue.</p><p>− 20% of software errors cause 80% of software failures.</p><p>− 20% of investors keep 80% of the profits obtained in the stock market, and this in turn has its origin in 20% of the values of an individual portfolio.</p><p>And so on…</p><p><strong>Identify businesses where the lessons seen in Microeconomics are given, describe why.</strong></p><p><strong>Niches/ Power Law</strong></p><p><strong>76</strong></p><p><strong>Specialization/ Circle of Competence</strong></p><p><strong>Principal–Agent Problem</strong></p><p><strong>Incentives</strong></p><p><strong>Pareto Principle</strong></p><p><strong>77</strong></p><p><strong>Game theory</strong></p><p><strong>I use game theory to help myself understand conflict situations and opportunities.</strong></p><p><strong>— Thomas Schelling</strong></p><p>Game theory is a branch of economics that studies the decisions in which, for an individual to be successful, they have to consider the decisions made by the rest of the agents that intervene in the situation.</p><p>Game theory as a mathematical study has not been used exclusively in economics, but in management, strategy, psychology or even biology.</p><p>In game theory we don&#x27;t have to ask ourselves what we are going to do, we have to ask ourselves what we are going to do considering what we think others will do, they will act thinking as they think our actions will be. Game theory has been used in many businesses, economic, political decisions or even to win playing poker.</p><p>To represent graphically in game theory, matrices (also known as normal form) and decision trees are often used as tools to better understand the reasoning that leads to one point or another. In addition, the games can be solved using mathematics, although they are usually sophisticated enough to go into depth.</p><p>Although there were previous works, game theory begins with a study by Antoine Augustin Cournot on a duopoly in which a reduced version of the Nash equilibrium is reached as the appropriate level of prices and production is gradually reached. Later it could be said that the founder of game theory formally speaking was the mathematician John von Neuman, the same as the Manhattan project.</p><p>Since then, some economists have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for their work on the subject. Nash stands out, known for the movie &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; and because it is on the Nash equilibrium that many conclusions that have been made about game theory applied to real life are based.</p><p>NASH EQUILIBRIUM</p><p>The Nash equilibrium is reached in a situation in which none of the players (or agents) in a game in which there are two or more players, all of whom know the equilibria of the others, want to unilaterally change their decision because changing it would worsen their situation.</p><p><strong>78</strong></p><p>condition. When all the players have made a decision and cannot change it without worsening their well-being, a Nash equilibrium is considered to have been reached.</p><p>The Nash equilibrium may not be Pareto efficient (that is, there may be a situation in which all players increase their well-being without harming the others). However, sometimes the Nash equilibrium is the only alternative given the rules of the game despite the existence of a Pareto optimum.</p><p>As for the Nash equilibrium, it is a situation in which individuals will not have any incentive to change their strategy considering the decisions of their opponents. In other words, no one will gain anything if they decide to change their strategy assuming that other individuals change theirs.</p><p>This does not mean that the greatest utility is acquired for all players, but rather that each one responds optimally to the strategy of the rest.</p><p>The Nash equilibrium has been used to regulate situations of competition between companies and to design auctions of public awards. Legislation that considers the Nash equilibrium can prevent oligopolies, which is why antitrust legislation usually seeks ways to prevent prices from being agreed between the parties involved.</p><p>PRISONER’S DILEMMA</p><p>The Prisoner’s Dilemma is a story usually attributed to A. W. Tucker, which gives its name to the best known of the problems studied in Game Theory. This theory is a flourishing branch of the Theory of Rational Election that has proved to be very useful not only in Economics and Evolutionary Biology but also in Philosophy and Political and Social Theory.</p><p>Two prisoners held incommunicado in individual cells have committed two crimes, one minor and one serious. There is sufficient evidence to be condemned for the first, but not for the second unless someone confesses to having committed it. The prosecutor visits one of the prisoners and says: &quot;I have good news and bad news for you. The good news is that if none of you confess your serious crime, we can only sentence you to 2</p><p>years for your first crime and if you confess, I will convince the jury that you are a repentant man and that the wicked is your partner so that you would be free in one year and he would remain in prison for eight years.</p><p>The bad news is that I am going to make the same offer to your partner.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And what would happen if we both confessed?&quot; Asks the prisoner. &quot;Then, I will have no reason to benefit any of you. I will let justice take its course, and, since the crime is serious, I estimate that you will be both sentenced to at least four years.&quot; Thus, the prisoners face the following dilemma.</p><p><strong>79</strong></p><p>![Image 25]<!-- -->(C:\Program Files\Typora\images\000024.jpg)</p><p>Each one thinks that only two things can happen, that the other confesses or does not confess. If he confesses, it is better that I also do because otherwise, I will stay eight years in jail. If he does not confess and I do, then I can benefit from the prosecutor’s offer, and I will be free in a year. The conclusion is that whatever the other does, it is best to confess. Both reason in the same way, with which both confess and stay in jail much longer than they would have been if they had cooperated with each other and neither of them had confessed.</p><p><strong>Prisoner Dilemma</strong></p><p>This is a two-person game, but it could happen between n people, for example, in the case of a strike, which can be understood as a public good (tragedy of the commons).</p><p>Each worker may think: <em>Either there are enough workers who go on strike</em> <em>and achieve the objective of this collective action (for example, a wage</em> <em>increase, a reduction in working hours or an improvement in working</em> <em>conditions), or this does not happen.

And if the others do</em> <em>not go on strike, it is best that I do not go either, because I will be paying</em> <em>in vain the costs of my contribution to this collective action that will fail.</em></p><p>The problem is that the individually rational leads to collective failure.</p><p>The same can happen in the case of many other collective actions (demonstrations, revolutions, wars, voting, etc.) and in many other contexts, so this game has proven useful in a very wide and varied range of research in social sciences.

Therefore, psychology means study or treatise on the psyche.</p><p>A cognitive bias is a systematic misinterpretation of available information that influences the way we process thoughts, make judgments, and make decisions. The concept of cognitive bias was introduced by Israeli psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in 1972.</p><p><strong>The confidence people have in their beliefs is not a measure of the quality of evidence but of the</strong> <strong>coherence of the story, the mind has managed to construct.</strong></p><p><strong>— Daniel Kahneman</strong></p><p>The brain represents only 2-3% of our body weight, yet it uses approximately 20% of our energy. It is a rather <em>expensive</em> organ that constantly seeks to save energy by avoiding a high cognitive load. It is precisely because of this factor that many neuroscientists say that he is a <em>cognitive bum</em>.</p><p>This behavior of the brain directly affects our daily decision-making, which is not done in as rational a way as we like to believe, but rather, in many cases, relies on heuristics, procedures that help us when solving a problem. They are mental shortcuts, intuitive judgments that are based on partial knowledge, experience or assumptions that allow us to be more agile and that, therefore, can be useful when making a decision. However, these heuristics can lead us to incorrect judgments. It is then when these biases occur, cognitive errors that can make us act in an irrational way.</p><p>Psychologists Daniel Kahneman, Paul Slovic, and Amos Tversky introduced the concept of psychological bias in the early 1970s. They published their findings in their 1982 book, <em>Judgment Under Uncertainty</em>.</p><p><strong>82</strong></p><p><strong>Nothing in life is as important as you think it is, while you are thinking about it.</strong></p><p><strong>— Daniel Kahneman</strong></p><p>During the 19th century, human decision-making was held to be essentially rational, with a hyper-maximizing human being making near-perfect cost-benefit assessments for every decision. However, beginning in 1971 Tversky and Kahneman published scientific papers arguing that most important human decisions are based on a limited number of heuristic principles and not on a formal analysis of the problem, thus contradicting the rational model of decision-making in force at that time.</p><p>The proposed new approach gave rise to a flood of new research in psychology and also extended to other fields of research such as economics, law, sociology, medicine, or political science. All this research was key to the psychologist Daniel Kahneman receiving the Nobel Prize in economics in 2002.The enormous impact on our behavior and the youth of these discoveries that have given rise to the emerging field of knowledge known as <em>Behavioral Economics</em>, which is in its infancy, make this section the most important in the book.</p><p>It will not help us to know the rest of the models, <em>how things work</em> if we fall into biases, and make irrational decisions.</p><p>The path started by Kahneman and Tversky towards the search for rationality has just begun, and we don’t know where it will take us. At the moment, in the first decades of study, it has meant a revolution, no longer in psychology, but in economics and decision making, recognized worldwide when in 2002, Daniel Kahneman becomes the first non-economist to receive the <em>Nobel of Economics</em>. Kahneman is a psychologist.</p><p>Knowing that we are not rational, that we are biologically <em>wired</em> to not be, changes everything.</p><p>From this moment, the economics, unable to explain the real decisions of citizens and economic cycles, is forced to rely on psychology, which in turn relies on evolutionary biology and neuroscience to give birth to an emerging research field that has turned science upside down.</p><p>Charlie Munger is a great student of cognitive biases, knowing that it is the source of irrational decisions for intelligent people.

People work towards rewards, and away from punishments.</p><p>FedEx faced a peculiar problem. They wanted to deliver packages on time.</p><p>For this, they needed to load their airplanes before sunrise. The catch -</p><p>they were never on time. The night shift workers were paid by the hour, and expected to work the entire 8 hour night shift. The idea was, if they spend enough time on the shift, they’ll get the job done. (As some managers still think - in places with fixed work hours) Finally, somebody got the idea that it was foolish to pay the night shift by the hour. The employer wanted rapid loading of a plane, not maximized billable hours of employee service. Maybe if they paid the employees per shift and let all night shift employees go home when all the planes were loaded, the system would work better. And, lo and behold, that solution worked.</p><p><strong>If you would persuade, appeal to interest and not to reason.</strong></p><p><strong>- Ben Franklin</strong></p><p>This means, you should distrust the advice of your professional advisor -</p><p>specially when it’s good for the advisor. The general antidotes here are:</p><p>• fear professional advice when it is good for the advisor;</p><p>• learn and use the basic elements of your advisor’s trade as you deal with your advisor;</p><p>• double check, disbelieve, or replace much of what you’re told, to the degree that seems appropriate after objective thought.</p><p>The ubiquity of incentive-caused bias has vast consequences. For instance, a sales force living only on commissions will be much harder to keep moral than one under less pressure to earn their living.</p><p>Things work the same way with punishments, although not as well as rewards.</p><p><strong>Around the time of Caesar, there was a European tribe that, when the assembly horn blew, always</strong> <strong>killed the last warrior to reach his assigned place, and no one enjoyed fighting this tribe.</strong></p><p><strong>84</strong></p><p><strong>2.

Someone persuasive is a person who dominates this facet and who manages to effectively persuade another person.</p><p><strong>The 6 Principles Of Persuasion</strong></p><p>Robert Cialdini is world-renowned for his 1984 book &quot;Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion,&quot; a work that has become a go-to for businessmen, advertisers, and marketers. In that book, Cialdini lays out his much-cited six principles of persuasion or influence, which should be known and considered.</p><p><strong>RECIPROCITY</strong></p><p>According to this principle, human relationships tend to be reciprocal, in such a way that people tend to treat others in the same way that they are treated. If an individual is treated in a respectful and pleasant way, his response will be to reciprocate. In the same way, if he receives any gift or benefit, he will feel the need to return that favor. Another possibility is in the field of confidences: if someone tells us something secret or intimate, we will be more willing to tell something about ourselves.</p><p>The application of this principle in advertising is simple and is verified, for example, in the delivery of some unexpected gift or exclusive discount.</p><p>The influence of this psychological mechanism is greater the more the gift is perceived as something personal and dedicated.</p><p><strong>90</strong></p><p><strong>SCARCITY</strong></p><p>Due to the principle of scarcity, we are more willing to approach something if we notice that it is scarce or difficult to obtain. That is why we tend, for example, to value a rare or unique item more, or to have an interview with a person in high demand.</p><p>In advertising, the principle of scarcity is applied in &quot;limited time offers&quot;, or &quot;while stock lasts&quot;. Also, in online services that can be accessed only by invitation of someone who is already a user.</p><p><strong>AUTHORITY</strong></p><p>According to the principle of authority, we are more predisposed to let ourselves be influenced when we are questioned by an authority. This has nothing to do with coercion or the exercise of power, but with the aura of credibility and status that authority entails. We tend to believe that those in leadership positions have more knowledge, more experience, or more right to say.</p><p>The principle of authority is verified, for example, in the influence that opinion leaders have on public opinion. Sometimes, to get an idea, product or service accepted by a large number of people, it is only necessary to convince the experts in the field. This principle is also verified when a celebrity recommends a product or defends an idea, even when what he promotes is not related to her activity.</p><p><strong>CONSISTENCY</strong></p><p>The principle of consistency, also called commitment, refers to the fact that people will be much more willing to accept something if the proposal corresponds to the commitments or affirmations that they themselves have made in front of the person who offers them. In other words, we tend to try to show behaviors consistent with our previous behaviors, even when the previous behaviors were not very well thought out. This explains why, for example, it is more difficult to attract a new customer than to keep one that has already been obtained.</p><p>One way to put this principle into practice is the following. If, for example, we want a person to make a quick and impulsive decision, before making the proposal we should try to get the person to define themselves as spontaneous, impulsive, or adventurous, so that they are then better predisposed to accept.</p><p><strong>91</strong></p><p>![Image 29]<!-- -->(C:\Program Files\Typora\images\000012.png)</p><p><strong>LIKING</strong></p><p>The principle of liking, also known as attraction, tells us something that at first glance may seem simple: we are more predisposed to letting ourselves be influenced by people we like, and less by people who reject us. According to the &quot;halo effect&quot;, physically attractive people are often unconsciously attributed other positive values, such as honesty, transparency, and success. But sympathy is not necessarily linked to beauty, it can be given by bond and familiarity when one feels that the other person &quot;is like one&quot;.</p><p>This is verified in advertising in the use of beautiful models, as well as celebrities who enjoy the acceptance and sympathy of a certain audience.</p><p>In politics, the principle of sympathy is often used when trying to reinforce the idea that the candidate is an ordinary person, concerned about the same problems that affect one.</p><p><strong>CONSENSUS</strong></p><p>The principle of consensus or social proof is, in my opinion, one of the most interesting, and on another occasion, I have dedicated an article to it (you can find it here: social proof). This is the psychological mechanism by which we tend to accommodate ourselves to the majority opinion: we are more predisposed to accept something if others have already accepted it, and also to reject it if others have rejected it.</p><p>Its application is very frequent in advertising: if we see that a product has obtained very positive comments on the Internet, it is more likely that we will also buy it. Similarly, if we see that a brand has a large following on social media, we are more likely to follow it too.</p><p><strong>Be persuasive.</strong></p><p><strong>Reciprocity: Write a practical case where you use reciprocity to convince someone?</strong></p><p><strong>Scarcity: Write a practical case where you use scarcity to convince someone?</strong></p><p><strong>92</strong></p><p><strong>Authority: Write a practical case where you use authority to convince someone?</strong></p><p><strong>Consistency: Write a practical case where you use consistency to convince someone?</strong></p><p><strong>Liking: Write a practical case where you use liking to convince someone?</strong></p><p><strong>Consensus: Write a practical case where you use consensus to convince someone?</strong></p><p><strong>93</strong></p><p><strong>Ethics</strong></p><p><strong>A man without ethics is a wild beast loosed upon this world.</strong></p><p><strong>— Albert Camus</strong></p><p>Ethics is a discipline of philosophy that studies human behavior and its relationship with the notions of good and evil, moral precepts, duty, happiness, and common welfare.</p><p>The word ethics comes from the Latin ethĭcus, which in turn comes from the ancient Greek ἠθικός (êthicos), derived from êthos, which means</p><p>&#x27;character&#x27; or &#x27;belonging to character&#x27;.</p><p>The function of ethics as a discipline is to analyze the precepts of morality, duty and virtue that guide human behavior towards freedom and justice.</p><p>Ethics is very closely related to morality, but it is different from it. While morality refers to norms adopted by tradition, ethics is a discipline that reflects on what actions would be correct.</p><p>For this reason, in common language, ethics can also be understood as the value system that guides and orients human behavior towards the good.</p><p>The ability of an individual to decide whether something is morally right or not is called ethical criteria. There are different types of criteria that can be used in deciding, among them are the utilitarian criterion, focusing on justice and focusing on rights.</p><p>Each individual is capable of forging an image of what they are and want to be in a society, which is increasingly submerged in situations of risk regarding the individual identity of people. From that moment on, the family plays a very important role since it instills ethical and moral values.</p><p>In addition to this, ethics guides the individual in the evaluation of her actions, allowing a better understanding of the people around her, allowing the subject to have their own criteria.</p><p>The term ethics comes from the Greek word ethos, which originally meant</p><p>&quot;dwelling&quot;, &quot;place where one lives&quot; and which ended up pointing to someone&#x27;s peculiar and acquired &quot;character&quot; or &quot;way of being&quot;; custom (mos-moris: morality).</p><p><strong>94</strong></p><p><strong>ETHICAL VALUES</strong></p><p>They are patterns of behavior that adjust the behavior of the individual.</p><p>Ethical values are acquired through the individual development of people, with their experiences within the environment that surrounds them, such as family, school, social and the media.</p><p>The objective of ethical values is to keep the rules of the game clear in a society, in relation to the execution of specific functions within it.</p><p>Next, we will see the most important values, for a business and for life in general.</p><p><strong>LIBERTY</strong></p><p>The value of freedom lies in the fact that, thanks to it, we can express our ideas and opinions in public, have the education we want or follow the beliefs with which we identify, to name a few examples. Without freedom, none of these things would be possible.</p><p>But there is no absolute freedom. We exercise freedom always considering other values that are also important for living in society, such as respect and responsibility.</p><p><strong>JUSTICE</strong></p><p>Justice as a value is the moral principle of each individual who decides to live giving each one what corresponds or belongs to him. Justice is part of social, moral, and democratic values, hence its importance.</p><p>Justice is a virtue that all individuals must put into practice consistently and in search of both their own good and that of society.</p><p><strong>RESPONSIBILITY</strong></p><p>The value of responsibility lies in the fact that, thanks to it, we take care of each other and achieve family, community, and social development.</p><p>When someone is not responsible, it not only affects their own growth, but also harms others.</p><p>In society, people are expected to act responsibly, exercising their rights, and fulfilling their obligations as citizens.</p><p><strong>95</strong></p><p><strong>HONESTY</strong></p><p>Set of personal attributes, such as decency, modesty, dignity, sincerity, justice, rectitude, and honesty in the way of being and acting. The word comes from the Latin honestĭtas, honestitātis.</p><p>Honesty is a fundamental moral value to establish interpersonal relationships based on trust, sincerity, and mutual respect A person who acts honestly does so always supported by values such as truth and justice and does not put her own needs or interests before these. In this sense, he is a person attached to a code of conduct characterized by rectitude, probity, and honesty.</p><p><strong>RESPECT</strong></p><p>Without respect we would not consider the lives, opinions, and beliefs of others. All this would generate chaos and would be a step backwards for society. For this reason, every time we act with respect, we are contributing to creating a much more just and kinder world to live in.</p><p>Respecting the other just for the fact of being human, considering him an equal even though he looks, expresses himself or thinks differently, is one of the highest expressions of respect as a moral value.</p><p><strong>96</strong></p><p>![Image 30]<!-- -->(C:\Program Files\Typora\images\000051.png)</p><p><strong>Identify how you can apply these values to a business.</strong></p><p><strong>Liberty</strong></p><p><strong>Justice</strong></p><p><strong>Responsibility</strong></p><p><strong>Honesty</strong></p><p><strong>Respect</strong></p><p><strong>97</strong></p><p>![Image 31]<!-- -->(C:\Program Files\Typora\images\000041.jpg)</p><p><strong>Computers</strong></p><p><strong>I do not fear computers. I fear lack of them.</strong></p><p><strong>— Isaac Asimov</strong></p><p>In the first block of this manual, we have analyzed why the Internet is the best tool in history to create businesses and why it is changing the economy and society.</p><p>At this point we will specify how and with what tools to do it.</p><p>The goal is to create an online ecosystem that generates and captures demand.</p><p><strong>Demand Generation &amp; Demand Capture</strong></p><p><strong>98</strong></p><p><strong>DEMAND GENERATION</strong></p><p>The first phase of our business is to generate demand, attract an audience.</p><p>For which we must provide the greatest possible value to our public.</p><p>There is no such thing as sharing too much.</p><p>People don&#x27;t care who you are or what you do, the only thing that matters is what you can do for them, the value you bring them.</p><p>The Internet enables you to deliver value at scale.</p><p>We will see the two ways that we will consider for our business: <strong>Social Media</strong></p><p>The great advantage of social networks is in the business model itself focused on interacting and sharing.</p><p>For this reason, it is the best way to start adding value and finding our target audience.</p><p>Social networks allow us to deliver value in a leveraged way, in a multitude of formats:</p><p>− Video: YouTube, Vimeo, short videos on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook</p><p>− Image: Instagram mainly, but also Twitter and Facebook</p><p>− Audio: Podcasts especially, but also YouTube</p><p>− Text: Medium and Twitter for microblogging</p><p>The big drawback of social media is platform risk. As much care as we take with our content, the platform is not ours and they can limit our account or, in the worst case, block it.</p><p>Therefore, as soon as we have a substantial volume of more than 10,000</p><p>followers on any social network, we should focus on creating our own website.</p><p><strong>Website/ Blog/ Newsletter</strong></p><p>You own web page does not contain the interaction characteristics of social networks, but in its favor, it is totally under your control.</p><p><strong>99</strong></p><p>This allows us to eliminate platform risk. For this reason, from our social networks we must try to capture our target audience. One important aspect we will need to focus in is having our own mailing list.</p><p>It will be a slower job than growing a social network, but it is the only way we have to make sure that our business is, as much as possible, totally under our control and depends solely on us.</p><p><strong>DEMAND CAPTURE</strong></p><p>The goal of demand generation is to capture such demand.</p><p>For this there is no better way than to add value. The best marketing is the one that doesn&#x27;t look like marketing.</p><p>Let us remember our advantage over large companies: closeness, humanity, being a recognizable person.</p><p>The best marketing is trust, and there is nothing better to generate trust than to provide recurring value, transparently and honestly.</p><p>The goal is for the public to go to our sales page.</p><p><strong>Sales Page</strong></p><p>The importance of the sales page cannot be overstated.</p><p>A good publicist has always been and will continue to be very well paid.</p><p>The specialty of copywriting is becoming more important every day.</p><p>They convert traffic into money.</p><p>Everything learned in the psychology and persuasion blocks must be captured at this point.</p><p>The good news is that as always, the internet allows us to test and receive immediate feedback.</p><p>If we create a sales page that doubles the conversion rate (number of sales divided by the number of users who have navigated to the sales page), our income will double.</p><p>A beginner&#x27;s mistake is to believe that a good product sells itself.</p><p>Although it is true that the objective of our business will be to make the product that best suits our public and that it will be a basic aspect for sales, it is no less true that without good sales communication our public will not be so willing to buy it.</p><p><strong>100</strong></p><p>![Image 32]<!-- -->(C:\Program Files\Typora\images\000027.png)</p><p>Some good pages to sell our products are Gumroad or Shopify, although there are other good alternatives such as Teachable, Etsy, Podia, WooCommerce or Sellfy.</p><p><strong>Identify which tools you will use in your business and define the reason for your selection.</strong></p><p><strong>Demand Generation</strong></p><p><strong>Demand Capture</strong></p><p><strong>101</strong></p><p><strong>BUSINESS</strong></p><p><strong>The money you make is a symbol of the value you create.</strong></p><p><strong>- Idowu Koyenikan</strong></p><p>In the previous section we have defined the map (know yourself) and the destination (purpose), we have set you up as a driver (get better) and at this point we are going to prepare the car (business).</p><p>The best businesses are those that promote the 5 principles that MJ</p><p>DeMarco listed in his book The Millionaire Fastlane:</p><p>− Control: you must have full control of the business</p><p>− Entry: the higher the barrier to entry for your competition, the better your business will be</p><p>− Need: must cover a need of society</p><p>− Time: income must not be linked to time</p><p>− Scale: the more scalable you are, the more you can grow A business focused on your purpose and based on the Internet enhances these 5 principles:</p><p>− Focused on you and your purpose enhances the principles of: o Control: you are the engine of the business, you have 100%</p><p>control</p><p>o Entry: no one can compete with you on being you, you are the brand</p><p>o Need: in your mental map you have detected that your purpose fulfills a need</p><p>− Based on the internet, it enhances the principles of: o Time: Internet works 24 hours a day, 365 days a year o Scale: Internet is global, you have no limits in your business <strong>102</strong></p><p>Thus, based on your purpose, the business is the system that allows you to add value to society at scale.</p><p>The first section of this block will prompt you to tell your story.

They need a story.</strong></p><p><strong>- Daniel Kahneman</strong></p><p>Your uniqueness is your opportunity. Your skills, interests, experiences, and of course, also your history.</p><p>The price of creating a personal online business is to expose yourself, that people get to know you. The better they know you, the more they will trust you. This is a huge advantage over large corporations, which, despite their attempts, will always be seen as more impersonal than a personal business.</p><p>As you become better known, you will receive not only praise, but also criticism. No matter what you do, even when you do not do anything very often you will be criticized. By scaling your business, you will be adding value to more and more people, and the flipside of this coin is that, as more people get to know you, there will be some who will criticize you. At first, it will feel unfamiliar having strangers criticizing you, but you will be able to overcome this experience and it will improve you as a person and make you more resilient.</p><p>Criticism improves us for two main reasons. When criticism is sensible, it will be the best feedback we can have to improve ourselves and our business. When criticism does not contribute anything, it will help us to be more stoic, to focus on what we can control and not give importance to other aspects, improving our emotional intelligence and therefore our lives.</p><p>It is surprising how human beings adapt to criticism. What can hurt you at the beginning of building your business, you will see with indifference and even with joy some time, because you will see that it has served you to grow.</p><p>Who are you? How did you get here? Where are you going? The answers to these questions will bring you closer to your audience, helping you generate demand. Human beings are social animals, we have evolved that way, that&#x27;s why stories attract us. Tales and myths are just examples, those stories have been the best method to convey the moral lessons of each culture.</p><p>In the world there is a lot of competition, to separate yourself from it the best way is to identify your unique skills.</p><p><strong>104</strong></p><p>Let&#x27;s study an example. If your purpose is to be a &quot;coach&quot;, there are thousands of them, and it will be difficult for the public to know why they should choose you over someone else since they cannot find a significant difference. Therefore, you have to identify your unique abilities and list them. Imagine that you have interests and knowledge of meditation and breathing techniques. In this case you can sell your service as a &quot;coach with knowledge of meditation and breathing techniques.&quot; That way you will be separating yourself from your competition. You will be creating your brand.</p><p>At this point it is worth highlighting one of the main mistakes people make when creating a business: being too generic.</p><p>Continuing with the previous example, one might think that &quot;coach&quot; is better than &quot;coach with knowledge of meditation and breathing techniques&quot; since in the first case the target audience we are addressing is much broader. But what is the point of being broader if your business does not have any advantage over the thousands of other businesses that exist. Being a generalist is an inconvenience because the competition is greater, especially with large companies.</p><p>Specify the problem, go to a specific niche. The more specific the better, remember the long tail. There may be millions of coaches but, for example, coach of dentists specialized in orthodontics there are only very few.</p><p>Let&#x27;s look at the sports brands of clothing and accessories. Nike is the undisputed leader, followed by Adidas. The only way to get into the industry is to be more specific. That is precisely what Under Armour did.</p><p>Kevin Plank got tired of having to change his sweaty shirts. Observing that his pants were not, he designed a sweat-wicking tech jersey. Let&#x27;s look at the extreme specificity: a t-shirt.</p><p>As for growth, it was extremely specific. The brand focused on the NFL</p><p>and the Oliver Stone movie <em>Any Given Sunday</em>. The rest is history.</p><p>And history repeats itself. In 2012, when it was thought that there was no room for him in sportswear, a 19-year-old Englishman in love with the gym started selling sports supplements from his parents’ garage.</p><p>He soon started selling his own gym clothing. With a young and aggressive brand, relying on young emerging Instagram influencers for its marketing. Again, let&#x27;s look at the specificity: gym clothes for young people.</p><p>Nine years later, in 2021, this young man named Ben Francis sold 21%</p><p>of the company in a deal that valued Gymshark at £1bn.</p><p><strong>105</strong></p><p>![Image 33]<!-- -->(C:\Program Files\Typora\images\000014.png)</p><p>Neither Kevin Plank nor Ben Francis thought of creating a generalist brand. As such, they could not have competed with established brands such as Nike, Adidas or even Puma.</p><p>Starting from their passion for sports and the gym, they detected a very specific need, made it productive, and scaled it.</p><p>The more personal your business is, the larger an audience you will reach. Remember, no one can compete with you on being you.</p><p>Most of the information is on the Internet, it has become a commodity.</p><p>The value is in differentiating yourself.

Define an ideal profile that would be your client.</strong></p><p><strong>106</strong></p><p><strong>Articulate The Problem And The Solution</strong> <strong>Victory comes from finding opportunities in problems.</strong></p><p><strong>— Sun Tzu</strong></p><p>Identify how you can help people.</p><p>People are not interested in who you are, what you do, what you have studied, etc. if you don&#x27;t add value to them.</p><p>People are interested in what you can do for them. How can you help them? How does your business improve their lives? What problem are you solving for them?</p><p>Your business must focus on the value it brings.</p><p>For this we will rely on the following strategies.</p><p><strong>BE SPECIFIC</strong></p><p>You have to articulate the problem your audience has and the solution to it, the more concrete the better.</p><p>Following the previous example of coaching with meditation, you should not focus on generic messages such as &quot;I will make you feel better&quot; but you should look to be much more specific &quot;I will eliminate your states of anxiety in times of work stress.&quot;</p><p>The more specific the easier it will be for your audience to imagine themselves in that situation.</p><p>This way, the customer will know exactly what to expect from the product or service.</p><p><strong>BEFORE &amp; AFTER</strong></p><p>Human beings find it difficult to assess different things individually, we are biologically wired to compare.</p><p>Evolution has designed us to compare among the available options, not to value each of them independently.</p><p><strong>107</strong></p><p>Thus, for example, when we see a Volkswagen Golf car, we may not be able to make any clear assessment. But when we see it next to a Volkswagen Polo, we could assess that the Golf is a better car than the Polo. But if we see the Golf next to a Ferrari, the Golf will seem like a worse car than the Ferrari.</p><p>This comparison bias is continually used by companies in their marketing. If a store wants to sell an $800 television, they will place it next to a more expensive one.</p><p>For this reason, a great way to show the public the benefits of our product or service is to show the before and after of using it.</p><p>A basic example is that of personal trainers, who as early as possible in their websites, show the &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; of their program.</p><p>This is how we should identify them:</p><p>− Before: It will be our ideal audience, with the problem.</p><p>− After: It will be our ideal audience, without any problem, after using our product or service.</p><p><strong>SOCIAL PROOF</strong></p><p>The best marketing is a satisfied customer.</p><p>As social animals we are interested in other people. We have evolved that way.</p><p>Therefore, we must focus on reviews. The Internet has increased the importance of this aspect enormously. Ratings, whether for movies, books, restaurants, or hotels, are perhaps the most important aspect when choosing an option.</p><p>Ask customers for reviews and make them visible, show them, publish them.</p><p><strong>PROOF OF WORK</strong></p><p>There is no such thing as sharing too much.</p><p>People will buy your products because they like you, not because you are hiding something from them. Example: Art Music, Books….</p><p>A very common mistake is to think that sharing my work for free is unfavorable:</p><p>− My competitors can copy me</p><p><strong>108</strong></p><p>![Image 34]<!-- -->(C:\Program Files\Typora\images\000040.png)</p><p>− My clients will not buy my product since they will have the &quot;value&quot;</p><p>of my work for free.</p><p>But the reality is just the opposite:</p><p>− If my competitors want to copy me, it is because my product works, and I am a reference in the sector</p><p>− If I am delivering value to my audience, they will buy the product for the value I offer them</p><p>Share your work.</p><p><strong>Articulate the problem and the solution</strong></p><p><strong>What is the problem you solve?</strong></p><p><strong>What is the solution you propose?</strong></p><p><strong>What is the before and after of your solution?</strong></p><p><strong>109</strong></p><p><strong>Leverage Your Knowledge On Online Platforms</strong> <strong>Remembering what makes us human is how to show economic value in the age of smarter and</strong> <strong>smarter machines.</strong></p><p><strong>- Thomas Friedman</strong></p><p>In the first block of this manual, we have analyzed why the Internet is the best tool in history to create businesses and why it is changing the economy and society.</p><p>At this point we will specify how and with what tools to do it.</p><p>As we have seen in the previous section, the idea is to create an online ecosystem that generates and captures demand.</p><p>With so many tools at our disposal we can feel overwhelmed. Therefore, the approach we must take to choose them is to focus on our skills, our message, and our business.</p><p><strong>BOOST YOUR CAPABILITIES</strong></p><p>The Internet allows us to enhance our capabilities.</p><p>We must analyze how we can add more value, looking at our skills and our message.</p><p>If we have great skill in synthesizing ideas and our message can be delivered in small doses, perhaps we should consider a microblogging platform like Twitter. If what we are good at is speaking and it is how we deliver the most value, perhaps we should consider creating a Podcast. If we prefer to deliver our value by writing, we should focus on a blog or newsletter. If we are more inclined towards on image, photos, or design, we should focus on Instagram. If we want to communicate with video, we should consider YouTube. If groups and communities fit us more, we should value tools such as Facebook or Slack.</p><p>These are just some examples. Our product can use various forms of communication and in the future, there will surely be new tools that we do not know about today. What we have to stay with is the idea. Detect how we deliver better value and start from there.</p><p>At this point we must also consider our target audience, which message format is most suitable for them. For example, if our target audience is <strong>110</strong></p><p>young people interested in fashion, then image and video will be preferred to just text. In that case, we can make good use of Instagram or YouTube.</p><p>But if our target audience are senior executives interested in current analysis, text would be an ideal medium, so we should value Twitter, a blog, a newsletter, etc.</p><p><strong>FOCUS</strong></p><p>It is a common mistake to start on several platforms at the same time.</p><p>The idea of wanting to create a large ecosystem at the beginning can lead us to think that it is a good idea to focus on several social networks. But compound interest makes it optimal to initially focus on a single social network until we have a substantial following, before moving on to the next social network.</p><p>Thus, it is better to have, for example, 15,000 followers on Twitter, rather than 2,000 on Twitter and 2,000 on Instagram.</p><p>Compound interest is appreciated from a certain volume, so the great effort is at the beginning, when you are mostly unknown yet. For this reason, it will be better to focus this effort on a single social network, until reaching more than 10,000 followers, at which point compound interest begins to be important for growth, allowing you to think about the next social network if so you wish.</p><p><strong>REDUCE PLATFORM RISK</strong></p><p>Although a social network is enough, and many successful businesses work with just one. The clearest example would be YouTubers. Creating a second network minimizes the risks of overreliance on a single platform, for instance having your account on that platform closed or limited.</p><p>The best way to eliminate this platform risk is by having your own website, with a blog and a newsletter. This should be your goal.</p><p>Although the power social networks with interactions, sharing, commenting, etc. could be the best way to grow, your objective should be as soon as you have a significant volume of followers, to take them to your own website, creating your own distribution list.</p><p><strong>CREATE YOUR TRIBE</strong></p><p><strong>111</strong></p><p>![Image 35]<!-- -->(C:\Program Files\Typora\images\000000.png)</p><p><strong>Product-market fit is easy if you start with community.</strong></p><p><strong>— Sahil Lavingia</strong></p><p>Evaluate the possibility of creating a community.</p><p>In communities, the value generated is exponential, since not only you offer value to your customers, but also value is offered to each other.</p><p>Greatly increasing the value of the community.</p><p>Some tools to create communities are Reddit, Circle.so, Discord, Facebook groups, Slack or discussion forums, among others.</p><p><strong>Define how you will leverage your knowledge on the platforms.</strong></p><p><strong>According to your skil s and your purpose, in which platform does your busines fit best?</strong></p><p><strong>Define how you wil deliver value to your public on social networks</strong></p><p><strong>Define how you wil deliver value to your public on your own web page</strong></p><p><strong>Will you create a tribe? Where?</strong></p><p><strong>112</strong></p><p><strong>Create Products</strong></p><p><strong>Great companies are built on great products.</strong></p><p><strong>- Elon Musk</strong></p><p>Productize yourself.</p><p>Everything you know, all your experience, your personality, has to result in a product. The best product you can create.</p><p>You must condense your knowledge into a product that gives value to your clients. That takes you from situation A to B, from before to after.</p><p>Continuing with the previous example of a coach focused on meditation and breathing, some product ideas would be:</p><p>− Meditation and breathing course to reduce your anxiety at work</p><p>− Meditation and breathing course for people with insomnia</p><p>− Monthly subscription to the best breathing exercises to change your mood</p><p>− Subscription to our online community to learn to meditate</p><p>− …</p><p>These are just a few examples; the options are endless.</p><p>To optimize the user experience, the characteristics that your product should have, are the following:</p><p><strong>PERSONAL</strong></p><p>Following the previously mentioned lesson of telling our story, the result must be to create a totally personal product.</p><p><strong>Sing the song that only you can sing, write the book that only you can write, build the product that</strong> <strong>only you can build... live the life that only you can live.</strong></p><p><strong>- Naval Ravikant</strong></p><p><strong>113</strong></p><p><strong>CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT</strong></p><p>One of the main advantages of creating a product online is that you can always improve it.</p><p>Continuing with our example, if you are a coach and offer face-to-face sessions, it is logical to think, especially if you make an effort at it, that over time you will improve, and the sessions will be of higher quality.</p><p>But your current customers may not be able to benefit from these improvements.</p><p>An online product allows you to continuously improve it, and if you wish, update it at no cost to all customers who had already purchased it. Which ensures that your customers, regardless of when they have decided to purchase your product, have the best experience that you can offer them.</p><p>This is possible to implement on any products, such as the coaching courses that we mentioned before, as well as subscriptions. If I have created a community or software that solves a problem, improving it can benefit all customers.</p><p><strong>SELF-EXPLANATORY</strong></p><p><strong>If you can’t make something self-evident, you at least need to make it self-explanatory.”</strong></p><p><strong>— Steve Krug</strong></p><p>The idea is that our product is well documented and available 24/7, so that it should not require us to reply to questions and suggestions in real time.</p><p>Therefore, the product must be as self-explanatory as possible. We must focus on making it very easy to follow and consume.</p><p>We will ask for feedback, and we will be available to our customers, but to make the customer autonomous and not dependent on us, the product must be as easy to use as possible.</p><p>This can be achieved even with complicated products. Just because they&#x27;re complicated doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re hard to use. Anyone can do something complicated; the idea is to make it simple.</p><p>A good example is personal computers, or smartphones. They can perform many tasks that would have been unthinkable just a few decades ago. But even a child can use it.</p><p><strong>114</strong></p><p>If you take something complicated and simplify it so that it is easy to understand, you will succeed. This is a very popular case on the internet, where practically all the information really is, so success comes from the way it is displayed for easy consumption.</p><p>Some examples are Netflix or Amazon. Its functionality may be found in other portals, but its easy usability makes people prefer these platforms.</p><p><strong>VALUE &amp; PRICE</strong></p><p>The main advantage of an online product is scalability.</p><p>Your product will be consumed by thousands of users, which means that you can reduce its price.</p><p>We continue with our example. A personal coaching course of 25 hours can cost more than $1,000 since the coach makes his hours available to the client. If we value them at $100, the price will be $2,500.</p><p>By packaging our knowledge into a product that hundreds of customers will buy, we can lower this cost per hour for each customer.</p><p>Thus, we can sell the 25-hour course cheaper, for example for $250, since it is not only addressed to one client but to many. So, if we have 100</p><p>clients, we will be earning $25,000 for 25 dedicated hours, which is $1,000 per hour. If we have 1,000 clients, we will have earned $10,000</p><p>per hour worked. This is scalability.</p><p>And more importantly, the customer will be buying a product valued at $2,500 for a price 10 times cheaper, of just $250.</p><p>The Internet allows both the producer and the customer to benefit from economies of scale. That is why we must focus on creating a product that has a real value as high as possible, 10 times more. If you sell a product for a price 10 times less than its value, you will do well in business.</p><p><strong>BOOST YOUR SKILLS</strong></p><p>In the same way that we have focused on an online platform that adapts to our skills and message to begin with, we must do the same for our product.</p><p>We must detect</p><p>Again, focus on what you do best:</p><p>− Speak: Webinars, podcasts, videos...</p><p><strong>115</strong></p><p>− Writing: Manuals, guides…</p><p>− …</p><p><strong>RECURRENCE</strong></p><p>The best businesses are those that offer recurring income.</p><p>A course is a good deal, but it can only be sold once to each customer.</p><p>On the other hand, a newsletter or a subscription to a community generates recurring income.</p><p>Many of the world&#x27;s largest companies follow this business model, as well as many of the most successful start-ups.</p><p>From Amazon’s AWS to Microsoft&#x27;s Office licenses or to the monthly subscription of Shopify or Snowflake, the best businesses are based on creating a solution that you have to pay recurrently to use it. Simplifying the structure for the client and improving their experience since the service will always be up to date.</p><p>For this reason, although they are compatible and it is still advisable to create products that are sold only once, we must think of recurring services to grow our business. It is not mandatory, but it is recommended.</p><p><strong>COMMUNITY</strong></p><p>The Internet has taken the network effect to another level.</p><p>Network effects are said to occur when the value of a good or service depends on the number of people who use it.</p><p>In general, when there is a network effect, the greater the number of users, the greater the value or utility that good or service will have.</p><p>Facebook, JustEat, PayPal, eBay, Alphabet (the parent company of Google), Amazon or Visa are some of the global companies that have generated the highest profits on the stock market in recent years while they wove extensive user communities that the more participants add up, the more value they have.</p><p>These benefits are not only available to large companies, but they are also available to small businesses.</p><p>Creating your own community will be the best way to generate value, since not only you will be adding value to your customers, but by interacting between them, as users, they will add great value as well. This <strong>116</strong></p><p>![Image 36]<!-- -->(C:\Program Files\Typora\images\000043.png)</p><p>will increase the value of your community and therefore your business, which will attract new customers to your community and your other products.</p><p><strong>Define your products.</strong></p><p><strong>Detail how your product wil be to maximize that it includes the maximum of previous points</strong></p><p><strong>117</strong></p><p><strong>Iterate</strong></p><p><strong>It isn’t 10,000 hours that creates outliers, it’s 10,000 iterations.</strong></p><p><strong>- Naval Ravikant</strong></p><p>Test in public.

Peterson</strong></p><p>The life of human beings for the vast majority of the time we have lived on this planet has been plagued with enormous risks and threats, this has resulted in evolution rewarding a very risk-averse brain.</p><p>Progress, especially in recent centuries, has diminished if not eliminated those risks. Being attacked by a predator, being without shelter to protect ourselves or without food are practically non-existent threats in today&#x27;s society.</p><p>Our environment is much safer than what our internal wiring is prepared for. Our world changes faster than our biology. We are wired to survive in an environment that ceased to exist thousands of years ago.</p><p>This has made us give up our freedom for security. But this has come at a cost to our happiness and our physical and mental health, since we are forgetting the values that make us human: to create freely, adding value to society.</p><p>The Internet has made these values more readily available than ever before in human history.</p><p>The opportunity: Technology has made it easier than ever to achieve these values.</p><p>The cost: getting them has a price, managing to add value to society.</p><p>If something defines us humans, it is the ability to create complex tools.</p><p>Everything you see around you, from cars to cell phones, has been created by people.</p><p>Creating is in our DNA and we feel good when we create, as the internal reward system rewards us, and we feel empty when we don&#x27;t.</p><p><strong>133</strong></p><p>![Image 51]<!-- -->(C:\Program Files\Typora\images\000032.jpg)</p><p>Bronnie Ware, an Australian nurse, asked terminally ill patients what they regret in life.
