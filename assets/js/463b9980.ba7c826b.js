To\ntheir amazement, the book became an overnight sensation,\nand edition after edition rolled off the presses to\nkeep up with the increasing public demand. Now to Win\nFriends and InfEuence People took its place in publishing\nhistory as one of the all-time international best-sellers.\nIt touched a nerve and filled a human need that was\nmore than a faddish phenomenon of post-Depression\ndays, as evidenced by its continued and uninterrupted\nsales into the eighties, almost half a century later.\nDale Carnegie used to say that it was easier to make a\nmillion dollars than to put a phrase into the English language.\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People became\nsuch a phrase, quoted, paraphrased, parodied,\nused in innumerable contexts from political cartoon to\nnovels. The book itself was translated into almost every\nknown written language. Each generation has discovered\nit anew and has found it relevant.\nWhich brings us to the logical question: Why revise a\nbook that has proven and continues to prove its vigorous\nand universal appeal? Why tamper with success?\nTo answer that, we must realize that Dale Carnegie\nhimself was a tireless reviser of his own work during his\nlifetime. How to Win Friends and Influence People was\nwritten to be used as a textbook for his courses in Effective\nSpeaking and Human Relations and is still used in\nthose courses today. Until his death in 1955 he constantly\nimproved and revised the course itself to make it\napplicable to the evolving needs of an every-growing\npublic. No one was more sensitive to the changing currents\nof present-day life than Dale Carnegie. He constantly\nimproved and refined his methods of teaching;\nhe updated his book on Effective Speaking several\ntimes. Had he lived longer, he himself would have revised\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People to better\nreflect the changes that have taken place in the world\nsince the thirties.\nMany of the names of prominent people in the book,\nwell known at the time of first publication, are no longer\nrecognized by many of today\u2019s readers. Certain examples\nand phrases seem as quaint and dated in our social\nclimate as those in a Victorian novel. The important message\nand overall impact of the book is weakened to that\nextent.\nOur purpose, therefore, in this revision is to clarify\nand strengthen the book for a modern reader without\ntampering with the content. We have not \u201cchanged\u201d\nHowto Win Friends and Influence People except to\nmake a few excisions and add a few more contemporary\nexamples. The brash, breezy Carnegie style is intact-even\nthe thirties slang is still there. Dale Carnegie wrote\nas he spoke, in an intensively exuberant, colloquial,\nconversational manner.\nSo his voice still speaks as forcefully as ever, in the\nbook and in his work. Thousands of people all over the\nworld are being trained in Carnegie courses in increasing\nnumbers each year. And other thousands are reading\nand studying How to Win Friends and lnfluence People\nand being inspired to use its principles to better their\nlives. To all of them, we offer this revision in the spirit\nof the honing and polishing of a finely made tool.\nDorothy Carnegie\n(Mrs. Dale Carnegie)\nHow This Book Was\nWritten-And Why\nDale Carnegie\nDuring the first thirty-five years of the twentieth century,\nthe publishing houses of America printed more\nthan a fifth of a million different books. Most of them\nwere deadly dull, and many were financial failures.\n\u201cMany,\u201d did I say? The president of one of the largest\npublishing houses in the world confessed to me that his\ncompany, after seventy-five years of publishing experience,\nstill lost money on seven out of every eight books\nit published.\nWhy, then, did I have the temerity to write another\nbook? And, after I had written it, why should you bother\nto read it?\nFair questions, both; and I'll try to answer them.\nI have, since 1912, been conducting educational\ncourses for business and professional men and women\nin New York. At first, I conducted courses in public\nspeaking only - courses designed to train adults, by actual\nexperience, to think on their feet and express their\nideas with more clarity, more effectiveness and more\npoise, both in business interviews and before groups.\nBut gradually, as the seasons passed, I realized that as\nsorely as these adults needed training in effective speaking,\nthey needed still more training in the fine art of\ngetting along with people in everyday business and social\ncontacts.\nI also gradually realized that I was sorely in need of\nsuch training myself. As I look back across the years, I\nam appalled at my own frequent lack of finesse and\nunderstanding. How I wish a book such as this had been\nplaced in my hands twenty years ago! What a priceless\nboon it would have been.\nDealing with people is probably the biggest problem\nyou face, especially if you are in business. Yes, and that\nis also true if you are a housewife, architect or engineer.\nResearch done a few years ago under the auspices of the\nCarnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching\nuncovered a most important and significant fact - a fact\nlater confirmed by additional studies made at the Carnegie\nInstitute of Technology. These investigations revealed\nthat even in such technical lines as engineering,\nabout 15 percent of one's financial success is due to\none\u2019s technical knowledge and about 85 percent is due\nto skill in human engineering-to personality and the\nability to lead people.\nFor many years, I conducted courses each season at\nthe Engineers\u2019 Club of Philadelphia, and also courses\nfor the New York Chapter of the American Institute of\nElectrical Engineers. A total of probably more than fifteen\nhundred engineers have passed through my\nclasses. They came to me because they had finally realized,\nafter years of observation and experience, that the\nhighest-paid personnel in engineering are frequently\nnot those who know the most about engineering. One\ncan for example, hire mere technical ability in engineering,\naccountancy, architecture or any other profession\nat nominal salaries. But the person who has\ntechnical knowledge plus the ability to express ideas, to\nassume leadership, and to arouse enthusiasm among\npeople-that person is headed for higher earning power.\nIn the heyday of his activity, John D. Rockefeller said\nthat \u201cthe ability to deal with people is as purchasable a\ncommodity as sugar or coffee.\u201d \u201cAnd I will pay more for\nthat ability,\u201d said John D., \u201cthan for any other under the\nsun.\u201d\nWouldn\u2019t you suppose that every college in the land\nwould conduct courses to develop the highest-priced\nability under the sun? But if there is just one practical,\ncommon-sense course of that kind given for adults in\neven one college in the land, it has escaped my attention\nup to the present writing.\nThe University of Chicago and the United Y.M.C.A.\nSchools conducted a survey to determine what adults\nwant to study.\nThat survey cost $25,000 and took two years. The last\npart of the survey was made in Meriden, Connecticut. It\nhad been chosen as a typical American town. Every\nadult in Meriden was interviewed and requested to answer\n156 questions-questions such as \u201cWhat is your\nbusiness or profession? Your education? How do you\nspend your spare time? What is your income? Your hobbies?\nYour ambitions? Your problems? What subjects are\nyou most interested in studying?\u201d And so on. That survey\nrevealed that health is the prime interest of adults\nand that their second interest is people; how to understand\nand get along with people; how to make people\nlike you; and how to win others to your way of thinking.\nSo the committee conducting this survey resolved to\nconduct such a course for adults in Meriden. They\nsearched diligently for a practical textbook on the subject\nand found-not one. Finally they approached one of\nthe world\u2019s outstanding authorities on adult education\nand asked him if he knew of any book that met the needs\nof this group. \u201cNo,\u201d he replied, \"I know what those\nadults want. But the book they need has never been\nwritten.\u201d\nI knew from experience that this statement was true,\nfor I myself had been searching for years to discover a\npractical, working handbook on human relations.\nSince no such book existed, I have tried to write one\nfor use in my own courses. And here it is. I hope you\nlike it.\nIn preparation for this book, I read everything that I\ncould find on the subject- everything from newspaper\ncolumns, magazine articles, records of the family courts,\nthe writings of the old philosophers and the new\npsychologists. In addition, I hired a trained researcher to\nspend one and a half years in various libraries reading\neverything I had missed, plowing through erudite tomes\non psychology, poring over hundreds of magazine articles,\nsearching through countless biographies, trying to\nascertain how the great leaders of all ages had dealt with\npeople. We read their biographies, We read the life stories\nof all great leaders from Julius Caesar to Thomas Edison.\nI recall that we read over one hundred biographies\nof Theodore Roosevelt alone. We were determined\nto spare no time, no expense, to discover every\npractical idea that anyone had ever used throughout the\nages for winning friends and influencing people.\nI personally interviewed scores of successful people,\nsome of them world-famous-inventors like Marconi\nand Edison; political leaders like Franklin D. Roosevelt\nand James Farley; business leaders like Owen D.\nYoung; movie stars like Clark Gable and Mary Pickford;\nand explorers like Martin Johnson-and tried to discover\nthe techniques they used in human relations.\nFrom all this material, I prepared a short talk. I called\nit \u201cHow to Win Friends and Influence People.\u201d I say\n\u201cshort.\u201d It was short in the beginning, but it soon\nexpanded to a lecture that consumed one hour and thirty\nminutes. For years, I gave this talk each season to the\nadults in the Carnegie Institute courses in New York.\nI gave the talk and urged the listeners to go out and\ntest it in their business and social contacts, and then\ncome back to class and speak about their experiences\nand the results they had achieved. What an interesting\nassignment! These men and women, hungry for self-\nimprovement, were fascinated by the idea of working in a\nnew kind of laboratory - the first and only laboratory of\nhuman relationships for adults that had ever existed.\nThis book wasn\u2019t written in the usual sense of the\nword. It grew as a child grows. It grew and developed\nout of that laboratory, out of the experiences of thousands\nof adults.\nYears ago, we started with a set of rules printed on a\ncard no larger than a postcard. The next season we\nprinted a larger card, then a leaflet, then a series of booklets,\neach one expanding in size and scope. After fifteen\nyears of experiment and research came this book.\nThe rules we have set down here are not mere theories\nor guesswork. They work like magic. Incredible as\nit sounds, I have seen the application of these principles\nliterally revolutionize the lives of many people.\nTo illustrate: A man with 314 employees joined one of\nthese courses. For years, he had driven and criticized\nand condemned his employees without stint or discretion.\nKindness, words of appreciation and encouragement\nwere alien to his lips. After studying the principles\ndiscussed in this book, this employer sharply altered his\nphilosophy of life. His organization is now inspired with\na new loyalty, a new enthusiasm, a new spirit of team-\nwork. Three hundred and fourteen enemies have been\nturned into 314 friends. As he proudly said in a speech\nbefore the class: \u201cWhen I used to walk through my establishment,\nno one greeted me. My employees actually\nlooked the other way when they saw me approaching.\nBut now they are all my friends and even the janitor\ncalls me by my first name.\u201d\nThis employer gained more profit, more leisure and\n-what is infinitely more important-he found far more\nhappiness in his business and in his home.\nCountless numbers of salespeople have sharply increased\ntheir sales by the use of these principles. Many\nhave opened up new accounts - accounts that they had\nformerly solicited in vain. Executives have been given\nincreased authority, increased pay. One executive reported\na large increase in salary because he applied\nthese truths. Another, an executive in the Philadelphia\nGas Works Company, was slated for demotion when he\nwas sixty-five because of his belligerence, because of his\ninability to lead people skillfully. This training not only\nsaved him from the demotion but brought him a promotion\nwith increased pay.\nOn innumerable occasions, spouses attending the banquet\ngiven at the end of the course have told me that\ntheir homes have been much happier since their husbands\nor wives started this training.\nPeople are frequently astonished at the new results\nthey achieve. It all seems like magic. In some cases, in\ntheir enthusiasm, they have telephoned me at my home\non Sundays because they couldn\u2019t wait forty-eight hours\nto report their achievements at the regular session of the\ncourse.\nOne man was so stirred by a talk on these principles\nthat he sat far into the night discussing them with other\nmembers of the class. At three o\u2019clock in the morning,\nthe others went home. But he was so shaken by a realization\nof his own mistakes, so inspired by the vista of a\nnew and richer world opening before him, that he was\nunable to sleep. He didn\u2019t sleep that night or the next\nday or the next night.\nWho was he? A naive, untrained individual ready to\ngush over any new theory that came along? No, Far from\nit. He was a sophisticated, blas\xe9 dealer in art, very much\nthe man about town, who spoke three languages fluently\nand was a graduate of two European universities.\nWhile writing this chapter, I received a letter from a\nGerman of the old school, an aristocrat whose forebears\nhad served for generations as professional army officers\nunder the Hohenzollerns. His letter, written from a\ntransatlantic steamer, telling about the application of\nthese principles, rose almost to a religious fervor.\nAnother man, an old New Yorker, a Harvard graduate,\na wealthy man, the owner of a large carpet factory, declared\nhe had learned more in fourteen weeks through\nthis system of training about the fine art of influencing\npeople than he had learned about the same subject during\nhis four years in college. Absurd? Laughable? Fantastic?\nOf course, you are privileged to dismiss this\nstatement with whatever adjective you wish. I am\nmerely reporting, without comment, a declaration made\nby a conservative and eminently successful Harvard\ngraduate in a public address to approximately six\nhundred people at the Yale Club in New York on the\nevening of Thursday, February 23, 1933.\n\u201cCompared to what we ought to be,\u201d said the famous\nProfessor William James of Harvard, \u201ccompared to what\nwe ought to be, we are only half awake. We are making\nuse of only a small part of our physical and mental resources.\nStating the thing broadly, the human individual\nthus lives far within his limits. He possesses powers of\nvarious sorts which he habitually fails to use,\u201d\nThose powers which you \u201chabitually fail to use\u201d! The\nsole purpose of this book is to help you discover, develop\nand profit by those dormant and unused assets,\n\u201cEducation,\u201d said Dr. John G. Hibben, former president\nof Princeton University, \u201cis the ability to meet life\u2019s\nsituations,\u201d\nIf by the time you have finished reading the first three\nchapters of this book- if you aren\u2019t then a little better\nequipped to meet life\u2019s situations, then I shall consider\nthis book to be a total failure so far as you are concerned.\nFor \u201cthe great aim of education,\u201d said Herbert Spencer,\n\u201cis not knowledge but action.\u201d\nAnd this is an action book.\nDALE CARNEGIENine Suggestions\non How to Get the Most\nOut of This Book"),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},'If you wish to get the most out of this book, there is\none indispensable requirement, one essential infinitely\nmore important than any rule or technique.

Just this: a deep,\ndriving desire to learn, a vigorous determination to increase\nyour ability to deal with people.\nHow can you develop such an urge? By constantly\nreminding yourself how important these principles are\nto you. Picture to yourself how their mastery will aid you\nin leading a richer, fuller, happier and more fulfilling\nlife.

After\nweeks of search, \u201cTwo Gun\u201d Crowley - the killer, the\ngunman who didn\u2019t smoke or drink - was at bay, trapped\nin his sweetheart\u2019s apartment on West End Avenue.\nOne hundred and fifty policemen and detectives laid\nsiege to his top-floor hideway. They chopped holes in\nthe roof; they tried to smoke out Crowley, the \u201ccop\nkiller,\u201d with teargas. Then they mounted their machine\nguns on surrounding buildings, and for more than an\nhour one of New York\u2019s fine residential areas reverberated\nwith the crack of pistol fire and the rut-tat-tat of\nmachine guns. Crowley, crouching behind an over-\nstuffed chair, fired incessantly at the police. Ten thousand\nexcited people watched the battle. Nothing like it\never been seen before on the sidewalks of New\nYork.\nWhen Crowley was captured, Police Commissioner\nE. P. Mulrooney declared that the two-gun desperado\nwas one of the most dangerous criminals ever encountered\nin the history of New York. \u201cHe will kill,\u201d said the\nCommissioner, \u201cat the drop of a feather.\u201d\nBut how did \u201cTwo Gun\u201d Crowley regard himself? We\nknow, because while the police were firing into his\napartment, he wrote a letter addressed \u201cTo whom it may\nconcern, \u201d And, as he wrote, the blood flowing from his\nwounds left a crimson trail on the paper. In this letter\nCrowley said: \u201cUnder my coat is a weary heart, but a\nkind one - one that would do nobody any harm.\u201d\nA short time before this, Crowley had been having a\nnecking party with his girl friend on a country road out\non Long Island. Suddenly a policeman walked up to the\ncar and said: \u201cLet me see your license.\u201d\nWithout saying a word, Crowley drew his gun and cut\nthe policeman down with a shower of lead. As the dying\nofficer fell, Crowley leaped out of the car, grabbed the\nofficer\u2019s revolver, and fired another bullet into the prostrate\nbody. And that was the killer who said: \u201cUnder my\ncoat is a weary heart, but a kind one - one that would do\nnobody any harm.\u2019\nCrowley was sentenced to the electric chair. When he\narrived at the death house in Sing Sing, did he say, \u201cThis\nis what I get for killing people\u201d? No, he said: \u201cThis is\nwhat I get for defending myself.\u201d\nThe point of the story is this: \u201cTwo Gun\u201d Crowley\ndidn\u2019t blame himself for anything.\nIs that an unusual attitude among criminals? If you\nthink so, listen to this:\n\u201cI have spent the best years of my life giving people\nthe lighter pleasures, helping them have a good time,\nand all I get is abuse, the existence of a hunted man.\u201d\nThat\u2019s Al Capone speaking. Yes, America\u2019s most notorious\nPublic Enemy- the most sinister gang leader who\never shot up Chicago. Capone didn\u2019t condemn himself.\nHe actually regarded himself as a public benefactor - an\nunappreciated and misunderstood public benefactor.\nAnd so did Dutch Schultz before he crumpled up\nunder gangster bullets in Newark. Dutch Schultz, one of\nNew York\u2019s most notorious rats, said in a newspaper interview\nthat he was a public benefactor. And he believed\nit.\nI have had some interesting correspondence with\nLewis Lawes, who was warden of New York\u2019s infamous\nSing Sing prison for many years, on this subject, and he\ndeclared that \u201cfew of the criminals in Sing Sing regard\nthemselves as bad men. They are just as human as you\nand I. So they rationalize, they explain. They can tell\nyou why they had to crack a safe or be quick on the\ntrigger finger. Most of them attempt by a form of reasoning,\nfallacious or logical, to justify their antisocial acts\neven to themselves, consequently stoutly maintaining\nthat they should never have been imprisoned at all.\u201d\nIf Al Capone, \u201cTwo Gun\u201d Crowley, Dutch Schultz,\nand the desperate men and women behind prison walls\ndon\u2019t blame themselves for anything - what about the\npeople with whom you and I come in contact?\nJohn Wanamaker, founder of the stores that bear his\nname, once confessed: \u201cI learned thirty years ago that it\nis foolish to scold. I have enough trouble overcoming my\nown limitations without fretting over the fact that God\nhas not seen fit to distribute evenly the gift of intelligence.\u201d\nWanamaker learned this lesson early, but I personally\nhad to blunder through this old world for a third of a\ncentury before it even began to dawn upon me that\nninety-nine times out of a hundred, people don\u2019t criticize\nthemselves for anything, no matter how wrong it\nmay be.\nCriticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive\nand usually makes him strive to justify himself.\nCriticism is dangerous, because it wounds a person\u2019s\nprecious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and\narouses resentment.\nB. F. Skinner, the world-famous psychologist, proved\nthrough his experiments that an animal rewarded for\ngood behavior will learn much more rapidly and retain\nwhat it learns far more effectively than an animal punished\nfor bad behavior. Later studies have shown that\nthe same applies to humans. By criticizing, we do not\nmake lasting changes and often incur resentment.\nHans Selye, another great psychologist, said, \u201cAs\nmuch as we thirst for approval, we dread condemnation,\u201d\nThe resentment that criticism engenders can demoralize\nemployees, family members and friends, and still\nnot correct the situation that has been condemned.\nGeorge B. Johnston of Enid, Oklahoma, is the safety\ncoordinator for an engineering company, One of his re-sponsibilities\nis to see that employees wear their hard\nhats whenever they are on the job in the field. He reported\nthat whenever he came across workers who were\nnot wearing hard hats, he would tell them with a lot of\nauthority of the regulation and that they must comply.\nAs a result he would get sullen acceptance, and often\nafter he left, the workers would remove the hats.\nHe decided to try a different approach. The next time\nhe found some of the workers not wearing their hard hat,\nhe asked if the hats were uncomfortable or did not fit\nproperly. Then he reminded the men in a pleasant tone\nof voice that the hat was designed to protect them from\ninjury and suggested that it always be worn on the job.\nThe result was increased compliance with the regulation\nwith no resentment or emotional upset.\nYou will find examples of the futility of criticism bristling\non a thousand pages of history, Take, for example,\nthe famous quarrel between Theodore Roosevelt and\nPresident Taft - a quarrel that split the Republican\nparty, put Woodrow Wilson in the White House, and\nwrote bold, luminous lines across the First World War\nand altered the flow of history. Let\u2019s review the facts\nquickly. When Theodore Roosevelt stepped out of the\nWhite House in 1908, he supported Taft, who was\nelected President. Then Theodore Roosevelt went off to\nAfrica to shoot lions. When he returned, he exploded.\nHe denounced Taft for his conservatism, tried to secure\nthe nomination for a third term himself, formed the Bull\nMoose party, and all but demolished the G.O.P. In the\nelection that followed, William Howard Taft and the Republican\nparty carried only two states - Vermont and\nUtah. The most disastrous defeat the party had ever\nknown.\nTheodore Roosevelt blamed Taft, but did President\nTaft blame himself? Of course not, With tears in his\neyes, Taft said: \u201cI don\u2019t see how I could have done any\ndifferently from what I have.\u201d\nWho was to blame? Roosevelt or Taft? Frankly, I don\u2019t\nknow, and I don\u2019t care. The point I am trying to make is\nthat all of Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s criticism didn\u2019t persuade\nTaft that he was wrong. It merely made Taft strive\nto justify himself and to reiterate with tears in his eyes:\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how I could have done any differently from\nwhat I have.\u201d\nOr, take the Teapot Dome oil scandal. It kept the\nnewspapers ringing with indignation in the early 1920s.\nIt rocked the nation! Within the memory of living men,\nnothing like it had ever happened before in American\npublic life. Here are the bare facts of the scandal: Albert\nB. Fall, secretary of the interior in Harding\u2019s cabinet,\nwas entrusted with the leasing of government oil reserves\nat Elk Hill and Teapot Dome - oil reserves that\nhad been set aside for the future use of the Navy. Did\nsecretary Fall permit competitive bidding? No sir. He\nhanded the fat, juicy contract outright to his friend Edward\nL. Doheny. And what did Doheny do? He gave\nSecretary Fall what he was pleased to call a \u201cloan\u201d of\none hundred thousand dollars. Then, in a high-handed\nmanner, Secretary Fall ordered United States Marines\ninto the district to drive off competitors whose adjacent\nwells were sapping oil out of the Elk Hill reserves.\nThese competitors, driven off their ground at the ends of\nguns and bayonets, rushed into court - and blew the lid\noff the Teapot Dome scandal. A stench arose so vile that\nit ruined the Harding Administration, nauseated an entire\nnation, threatened to wreck the Republican party,\nand put Albert B. Fall behind prison bars.\nFall was condemned viciously - condemned as few\nmen in public life have ever been. Did he repent?\nNever! Years later Herbert Hoover intimated in a public\nspeech that President Harding\u2019s death had been due to\nmental anxiety and worry because a friend had betrayed\nhim. When Mrs. Fall heard that, she sprang from her\nchair, she wept, she shook her fists at fate and screamed:\n"What! Harding betrayed by Fall? No! My husband\nnever betrayed anyone. This whole house full of gold\nwould not tempt my husband to do wrong. He is the one\nwho has been betrayed and led to the slaughter and crucified.\u201d\nThere you are; human nature in action, wrongdoers,\nblaming everybody but themselves. We are all like that.\nSo when you and I are tempted to criticize someone\ntomorrow, let\u2019s remember Al Capone, \u201cTwo Gun\u201d\nCrowley and Albert Fall. Let\u2019s realize that criticisms are\nlike homing pigeons. They always return home. Let\u2019s\nrealize that the person we are going to correct and condemn\nwill probably justify himself or herself, and condemn\nus in return; or, like the gentle Taft, will say: \u201cI\ndon\u2019t see how I could have done any differently from\nwhat I have.\u201d\nOn the morning of April 15, 1865, Abraham Lincoln\nlay dying in a hall bedroom of a cheap lodging house\ndirectly across the street from Ford\u2019s Theater, where\nJohn Wilkes Booth had shot him. Lincoln\u2019s long body\nlay stretched diagonally across a sagging bed that was\ntoo short for him. A cheap reproduction of Rosa Bonheur\u2019s\nfamous painting The Horse Fair hung above the\nbed, and a dismal gas jet flickered yellow light.\nAs Lincoln lay dying, Secretary of War Stanton said,\n\u201cThere lies the most perfect ruler of men that the world\nhas ever seen.\u201d\nWhat was the secret of Lincoln\u2019s success in dealing\nwith people? I studied the life of Abraham Lincoln for\nten years and devoted all of three years to writing and\nrewriting a book entitled Lincoln the Unknown. I believe\nI have made as detailed and exhaustive a study of\nLincoln\u2019s personality and home life as it is possible for\nany being to make. I made a special study of Lincoln\u2019s\nmethod of dealing with people. Did he indulge in criticism?\nOh, yes. As a young man in the Pigeon Creek\nValley of Indiana, he not only criticized but he wrote\nletters and poems ridiculing people and dropped these\nletters on the country roads where they were sure to be\nfound. One of these letters aroused resentments that\nburned for a lifetime.\nEven after Lincoln had become a practicing lawyer in\nSpringfield, Illinois, he attacked his opponents openly\nin letters published in the newspapers. But he did this\njust once too often.\nIn the autumn of 1842 he ridiculed a vain, pugnacious\npolitician by the name of James Shields. Lincoln lamned\nhim through an anonymous letter published in\nSpringfield Journal. The town roared with laughter.\nShields, sensitive and proud, boiled with indignation.\nHe found out who wrote the letter, leaped on his horse,\nstarted after Lincoln, and challenged him to fight a duel.\nLincoln didn\u2019t want to fight. He was opposed to dueling,\nbut he couldn\u2019t get out of it and save his honor. He was\ngiven the choice of weapons. Since he had very long\narms, he chose cavalry broadswords and took lessons in\nsword fighting from a West Point graduate; and, on the\nappointed day, he and Shields met on a sandbar in the\nMississippi River, prepared to fight to the death; but, at\nthe last minute, their seconds interrupted and stopped\nthe duel.\nThat was the most lurid personal incident in Lincoln\u2019s\nlife. It taught him an invaluable lesson in the art of dealing\nwith people. Never again did he write an insulting\nletter. Never again did he ridicule anyone. And from that\ntime on, he almost never criticized anybody for anything.\nTime after time, during the Civil War, Lincoln put a\nnew general at the head of the Army of the Potomac, and\neach one in turn - McClellan, Pope, Burnside, Hooker,\nMeade - blundered tragically and drove Lincoln to pacing\nthe floor in despair. Half the nation savagely condemned\nthese incompetent generals, but Lincoln, \u201cwith\nmalice toward none, with charity for all,\u201d held his peace.\nOne of his favorite quotations was \u201cJudge not, that ye be\nnot judged.\u201d\nAnd when Mrs. Lincoln and others spoke harshly of\nthe southern people, Lincoln replied: \u201cDon\u2019t criticize\nthem; they are just what we would be under similar\ncircumstances.\u201d\nYet if any man ever had occasion to criticize, surely it\nwas Lincoln. Let\u2019s take just one illustration:\nThe Battle of Gettysburg was fought during the first\nthree days of July 1863. During the night of July 4, Lee\nbegan to retreat southward while storm clouds deluged\nthe country with rain. When Lee reached the Potomac\nwith his defeated army, he found a swollen, impassable\nriver in front of him, and a victorious Union Army behind\nhim. Lee was in a trap. He couldn\u2019t escape. Lincoln\nsaw that. Here was a golden, heaven-sent opportunity-\nthe opportunity to capture Lee\u2019s army and end the war\nimmediately. So, with a surge of high hope, Lincoln ordered\nMeade not to call a council of war but to attack\nLee immediately. Lincoln telegraphed his orders and\nthen sent a special messenger to Meade demanding immediate\naction.\nAnd what did General Meade do? He did the very\nopposite of what he was told to do. He called a council\nof war in direct violation of Lincoln\u2019s orders. He hesitated.\nHe procrastinated. He telegraphed all manner of\nexcuses. He refused point-blank to attack Lee. Finally\nthe waters receded and Lee escaped over the Potomac\nwith his forces.\nLincoln was furious, \u201c What does this mean?\u201d Lincoln\ncried to his son Robert. \u201cGreat God! What does this\nmean? We had them within our grasp, and had only to\nstretch forth our hands and they were ours; yet nothing\nthat I could say or do could make the army move. Under\nthe circumstances, almost any general could have defeated\nLee. If I had gone up there, I could have whipped\nhim myself.\u201d\nIn bitter disappointment, Lincoln sat down and wrote\nMeade this letter. And remember, at this period of his\nlife Lincoln was extremely conservative and restrained\nin his phraseology. So this letter coming from Lincoln in\n1863 was tantamount to the severest rebuke.\nMy dear General,\nI do not believe you appreciate the magnitude of the misfortune\ninvolved in Lee\u2019s escape. He was within our easy\ngrasp, and to have closed upon him would, in connection\nWith our other late successes, have ended the war. As it is,\nthe war will be prolonged indefinitely. If you could not\nsafely attack Lee last Monday, how can you possibly do so\nsouth of the river, when you can take with you very few-\nno more than two-thirds of the force you then had in hand?\nIt would be unreasonable to expect and I do not expect that\nyou can now effect much. Your golden opportunity is gone,\nand I am distressed immeasurably because of it.\nWhat do you suppose Meade did when he read the\nletter?\nMeade never saw that letter. Lincoln never mailed it.\nIt was found among his papers after his death.\nMy guess is - and this is only a guess - that after writing\nthat letter, Lincoln looked out of the window and\nsaid to himself, \u201cJust a minute. Maybe I ought not to be\nso hasty. It is easy enough for me to sit here in the quiet\nof the White House and order Meade to attack; but if I\nhad been up at Gettysburg, and if I had seen as much\nblood as Meade has seen during the last week, and if my\nears had been pierced with the screams and shrieks of\nthe wounded and dying, maybe I wouldn\u2019t be so anxious\nto attack either. If I had Meade\u2019s timid temperament,\nperhaps I would have done just what he had done. Anyhow,\nit is water under the bridge now. If I send this\nletter, it will relieve my feelings, but it will make Meade\ntry to justify himself. It will make him condemn me. It\nwill arouse hard feelings, impair all his further usefulness\nas a commander, and perhaps force him to resign\nfrom the army.\u201d\nSo, as I have already said, Lincoln put the letter aside,\nfor he had learned by bitter experience that sharp criticisms\nand rebukes almost invariably end in futility.\nTheodore Roosevelt said that when he, as President,\nwas confronted with a perplexing problem, he used to\nlean back and look up at a large painting of Lincoln\nwhich hung above his desk in the White House and ask\nhimself, \u201cWhat would Lincoln do if he were in my\nshoes? How would he solve this problem?\u201d\nThe next time we are tempted to admonish somebody,\n/let\u2019s pull a five-dollar bill out of our pocket, look at Lincoln\u2019s\npicture on the bill, and ask. \u201cHow would Lincoln\nhandle this problem if he had it?\u201d\nMark Twain lost his temper occasionally and wrote\nletters that turned the Paper brown. For example, he\nonce wrote to a man who had aroused his ire: \u201cThe thing\nfor you is a burial permit. You have only to speak and I\nwill see that you get it.\u201d On another occasion he wrote\nto an editor about a proofreader\u2019s attempts to \u201cimprove\nmy spelling and punctuation.\u201d He ordered: \u201cSet the\nmatter according to my copy hereafter and see that the\nproofreader retains his suggestions in the mush of his\ndecayed brain.\u201d\nThe writing of these stinging letters made Mark Twain\nfeel better. They allowed him to blow off steam, and the\nletters didn\u2019t do any real harm, because Mark\u2019s wife\nsecretly lifted them out of the mail. They were never\nsent.\nDo you know someone you would like to change and\nregulate and improve? Good! That is fine. I am all in\nfavor of it, But why not begin on yourself? From a purely\nselfish standpoint, that is a lot more profitable than\ntrying to improve others - yes, and a lot less dangerous.\n\u201cDon\u2019t complain about the snow on your neighbor\u2019s\nroof,\u201d said Confucius, \u201cwhen your own doorstep is unclean.\u201d\nWhen I was still young and trying hard to impress\npeople, I wrote a foolish letter to Richard Harding\nDavis, an author who once loomed large on the literary\nhorizon of America. I was preparing a magazine article\nabout authors, and I asked Davis to tell me about his\nmethod of work. A few weeks earlier, I had received a\nletter from someone with this notation at the bottom:\n\u201cDictated but not read.\u201d I was quite impressed. I felt\nthat the writer must be very big and busy and important.\nI wasn\u2019t the slightest bit busy, but I was eager to make\nan impression on Richard Harding Davis, so I ended my\nshort note with the words: \u201cDictated but not read.\u201d\nHe never troubled to answer the letter. He simply\nreturned it to me with this scribbled across the bottom:\n\u201cYour bad manners are exceeded only by your bad manners.\u201d\nTrue, I had blundered, and perhaps I deserved\nthis rebuke. But, being human, I resented it. I resented\nit so sharply that when I read of the death of Richard\nHarding Davis ten years later, the one thought that still\npersisted in my mind - I am ashamed to admit - was the\nhurt he had given me.\nIf you and I want to stir up a resentment tomorrow\nthat may rankle across the decades and endure until\ndeath, just let us indulge in a little stinging criticism-\nno matter how certain we are that it is justified.\nWhen dealing with people, let us remember we are\nnot dealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing with\ncreatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices\nand motivated by pride and vanity.\nBitter criticism caused the sensitive Thomas Hardy,\none of the finest novelists ever to enrich English literature,\nto give up forever the writing of fiction. Criticism\ndrove Thomas Chatterton, the English poet, to suicide.\nBenjamin Franklin, tactless in his youth, became so\ndiplomatic, so adroit at handling people, that he was\nmade American Ambassador to France. The secret of his\nsuccess? \u201cI will speak ill of no man,\u201d he said, " . . and\nspeak all the good I know of everybody.\u201d\nAny fool can criticize, condemn and complain - and\nmost fools do.\nBut it takes character and self-control to be under-standing\nand forgiving.\n\u201cA great man shows his greatness,\u201d said Carlyle, \u201cby\nthe way he treats little men.\u201d\nBob Hoover, a famous test pilot and frequent per-former\nat air shows, was returning to his home in Los\nAngeles from an air show in San Diego. As described in\nthe magazine Flight Operations, at three hundred feet\nin the air, both engines suddenly stopped. By deft maneuvering\nhe managed to land the plane, but it was\nbadly damaged although nobody was hurt.\nHoover\u2019s first act after the emergency landing was to\ninspect the airplane\u2019s fuel. Just as he suspected, the\nWorld War II propeller plane he had been flying had\nbeen fueled with jet fuel rather than gasoline.\nUpon returning to the airport, he asked to see the mechanic\nwho had serviced his airplane. The young man\nwas sick with the agony of his mistake. Tears streamed\ndown his face as Hoover approached. He had just caused\nthe loss of a very expensive plane and could have caused\nthe loss of three lives as well.\nYou can imagine Hoover\u2019s anger. One could anticipate\nthe tongue-lashing that this proud and precise pilot\nwould unleash for that carelessness. But Hoover didn\u2019t\nscold the mechanic; he didn\u2019t even criticize him. Instead,\nhe put his big arm around the man\u2019s shoulder and\nsaid, \u201cTo show you I\u2019m sure that you\u2019ll never do this\nagain, I want you to service my F-51 tomorrow.\u201d\nOften parents are tempted to criticize their children.\nYou would expect me to say \u201cdon\u2019t.\u201d But I will not, I am\nmerely going to say, \u201cBefore you criticize them, read\none of the classics of American journalism, \u2018Father Forgets.\u2019 \u201d\nIt originally appeared as an editorial in the People\'s\nHome Journnl. We are reprinting it here with the\nauthor\u2019s permission, as condensed in the Reader\u2019s Digest:\n\u201cFather Forgets\u201d is one of those little pieces which-\ndashed of in a moment of sincere feeling - strikes an\nechoing chord in so many readers as to become a perenial\nreprint favorite. Since its first appearance, \u201cFather\nForgets" has been reproduced, writes the author,\nW, Livingston Larned, \u201cin hundreds of magazines and\nhouse organs, and in newspapers the country over. It has\nbeen reprinted almost as extensively in many foreign\nlanguages. I have given personal permission to thousands\nwho wished to read it from school, church, and\nlecture platforms. It has been \u2018on the air\u2019 on countless\noccasions and programs. Oddly enough, college periodicals\nhave used it, and high-school magazines. Sometimes\na little piece seems mysteriously to \u2018click.\u2019 This\none certainly did.\u201d\nFATHER FORGETS\nW. Livingston Larned\nListen, son: I am saying this as you lie asleep, one little\npaw crumpled under your cheek and the blond curls stickily\nwet on your damp forehead. I have stolen into your room\nalone. Just a few minutes ago, as I sat reading my paper\nin the library, a stifling wave of remorse swept over me.\nGuiltily I came to your bedside.\nThere are the things I was thinking, son: I had been cross\nto you. I scolded you as you were dressing for school because\nyou gave your face merely a dab with a towel. I took\nyou to task for not cleaning your shoes. I called out angrily\nwhen you threw some of your things on the floor.\nAt breakfast I found fault, too. You spilled things. You\ngulped down your food. You put your elbows on the table.\nYou spread butter too thick on your bread. And as you\nstarted off to play and I made for my train, you turned\nand waved a hand and called, \u201cGoodbye, Daddy!\u201d and\nI frowned, and said in reply, \u201cHold your shoulders\nback!\u201d\nThen it began all over again in the late afternoon. As I\ncame up the road I spied you, down on your knees, playing\nmarbles. There were holes in your stockings. I humiliated\nyou before your boyfriends by marching you ahead of me to\nthe house. Stockings were expensive - and if you had to\nbuy them you would be more careful! Imagine that, son,\nfrom a father!\nDo you remember, later, when I was reading in the library,\nhow you came in timidly, with a sort of hurt look in\nyour eyes? When I glanced up over my paper, impatient at\nthe interruption, you hesitated at the door. \u201cWhat is it you\nwant?\u201d I snapped.\nYou said nothing, but ran across in one tempestuous\nplunge, and threw your arms around my neck and kissed\nme, and your small arms tightened with an affection that\nGod had set blooming in your heart and which even neglect\ncould not wither. And then you were gone, pattering up the\nstairs.\nWell, son, it was shortly afterwards that my paper slipped\nfrom my hands and a terrible sickening fear came over me.\nWhat has habit been doing to me? The habit of finding fault,\nof reprimanding - this was my reward to you for being a\nboy. It was not that I did not love you; it was that I expected\ntoo much of youth. I was measuring you by the yardstick of\nmy own years.\nAnd there was so much that was good and fine and true in\nyour character. The little heart of you was as big as the\ndawn itself over the wide hills. This was shown by your\nspontaneous impulse to rush in and kiss me good night.\nNothing else matters tonight, son. I have come to your bed-side\nin the darkness, and I have knelt there, ashamed!\nIt is a feeble atonement; I know you would not understand\nthese things if I told them to you during your waking\nhours. But tomorrow I will be a real daddy! I will chum\nwith you, and suffer when you suffer, and laugh when you\nlaugh. I will bite my tongue when impatient words come. I\nwill keep saying as if it were a ritual: \u201cHe is nothing but a\nboy - a little boy!\u201d\nI am afraid I have visualized you as a man. Yet as I see\nyou now, son, crumpled and weary in your cot, I see that\nyou are still a baby. Yesterday you were in your mother\u2019s\narms, your head on her shoulder. I have asked too much,\ntoo much.\nInstead of condemning people, let\u2019s try to understand\nthem. Let\u2019s try to figure out why they do what they do.\nThat\u2019s a lot more profitable and intriguing than criticism;\nand it breeds sympathy, tolerance and kindness. \u201cTo\nknow all is to forgive all.\u201d\nAs Dr. Johnson said: \u201cGod himself, sir, does not propose\nto judge man until the end of his days.\u201d\nWhy should you and I?\nPRINCIPLE 1Don\u2019t criticize, condemn or complain.THE BIG SECRET OF DEALING WITHPEOPLEThere is only one way under high heaven to get anybody\nto do anything. Did you ever stop to think of that? Yes,\njust one way. And that is by making the other person want to do it.\nRemember, there is no other way.\nOf course, you can make someone want to give you his\nwatch by sticking a revolver in his ribs. YOU can make\nyour employees give you cooperation - until your back\nis turned - by threatening to fire them. You can make a\nchild do what you want it to do by a whip or a threat. But\nthese crude methods have sharply undesirable repercussions.\nThe only way I can get you to do anything is by giving\nyou what you want.\nWhat do you want?\nSigmund Freud said that everything you and I do\nsprings from two motives: the sex urge and the desire to\nbe great.\nJohn Dewey, one of America\u2019s most profound philosophers,\nphrased it a bit differently. Dr. Dewey said that\nthe deepest urge in human nature is \u201cthe desire to be\nimportant." Remember that phrase: \u201cthe desire to be\nimportant." It is significant. You are going to hear a lot\nabout it in this book.\nWhat do you want? Not many things, but the few\nthat you do wish, you crave with an insistence\nthat will not be denied. Some of the things most people\nwant include:'),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Health and the preservation of life."),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Food."),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Sleep."),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Money and the things money will buy."),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Life in the hereafter."),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Sexual gratification."),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"The well-being of our children."),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},'A feeling of importance.\nAlmost all these wants are usually gratified-all except\none. But there is one longing - almost as deep, almost\nas imperious, as the desire for food or sleep - which\nis seldom gratified. It is what Freud calls \u201cthe\ndesire to be great.\u201d It is what Dewey calls the \u201cdesire to\nbe important.\u201d\nLincoln once began a letter saying: \u201cEverybody likes\na compliment.\u201d William James said: "The deepest principle\nin human nature is the craving to be appreciated."\nHe didn\u2019t speak, mind you, of the \u201cwish\u201d or the \u201cdesire\u201d\nor the \u201clonging\u201d to be appreciated. He said the "craving\u201d\nto be appreciated.\nHere is a gnawing and unfaltering human hunger, and\nthe rare individual who honestly satisfies this heart hunger\nwill hold people in the palm of his or her hand and\n\u201ceven the undertaker will be sorry when he dies.\u201d\nThe desire for a feeling of importance is one of the\nchief distinguishing differences between mankind and\nthe animals. To illustrate: When I was a farm boy out in\nMissouri, my father bred fine Duroc-Jersey hogs and .\npedigreed white - faced cattle. We used to exhibit our\nhogs and white-faced cattle at the country fairs and live-stock\nshows throughout the Middle West. We won first\nprizes by the score. My father pinned his blue ribbons\non a sheet of white muslin, and when friends or visitors\ncame to the house, he would get out the long sheet of\nmuslin. He would hold one end and I would hold the\nother while he exhibited the blue ribbons.\nThe hogs didn\u2019t care about the ribbons they had won.\nBut Father did. These prizes gave him a feeling of importance.\nIf our ancestors hadn\u2019t had this flaming urge for a feeling\nof importance, civilization would have been impossible.\nWithout it, we should have been just about like\nanimals.\nIt was this desire for a feeling of importance that led\nan uneducated, poverty-stricken grocery clerk to study\nsome law books he found in the bottom of a barrel of\nhousehold plunder that he had bought for fifty cents.\nYou have probably heard of this grocery clerk. His name\nwas Lincoln.\nIt was this desire for a feeling of importance that inspired\nDickens to write his immortal novels. This desire\ninspired Sir Christoper Wren to design his symphonies\nin stone. This desire made Rockefeller amass millions\nthat he never spent! And this same desire made the richest\nfamily in your town build a house far too large for its\nrequirements.\nThis desire makes you want to wear the latest styles,\ndrive the latest cars, and talk about your brilliant children.\nIt is this desire that lures many boys and girls into\njoining gangs and engaging in criminal activities. The\naverage young criminal, according to E. P. Mulrooney,\nonetime police commissioner of New York, is filled with\nego, and his first request after arrest is for those lurid\nnewspapers that make him out a hero. The disagreeable\nprospect of serving time seems remote so long as he can\ngloat over his likeness sharing space with pictures of\nsports figures, movie and TV stars and politicians.\nIf you tell me how you get your feeling of importance,\nI\u2019ll tell you what you are. That determines your character.\nThat is the most significant thing about you. For\nexample, John D. Rockefeller got his feeling of importance\nby giving money to erect a modern hospital in\nPeking, China, to care for millions of poor people whom\nhe had never seen and never would see. Dillinger, on\nthe other hand, got his feeling of importance by being a\nbandit, a bank robber and killer. When the FBI agents\nwere hunting him, he dashed into a farmhouse up in\nMinnesota and said, \u201cI\u2019m Dillinger!\u201d He was proud of\nthe fact that he was Public Enemy Number One. \u201cI\u2019m\nnot going to hurt you, but I\u2019m Dillinger!\u201d he said.\nYes, the one significant difference between Dillinger\nand Rockefeller is how they got their feeling of importance.\nHistory sparkles with amusing examples of famous\npeople struggling for a feeling of importance. Even\nGeorge Washington wanted to be called \u201cHis Mightiness,\nthe President of the United States\u201d; and Columbus\npleaded for the title \u201cAdmiral of the Ocean and Viceroy\nof India.\u201d Catherine the Great refused to open letters\nthat were not addressed to \u201cHer Imperial Majesty\u201d; and\nMrs. Lincoln, in the White House, turned upon Mrs.\nGrant like a tigress and shouted, \u201cHow dare you be\nseated in my presence until I invite you!\u201d\nOur millionaires helped finance Admiral Byrd\u2019s expedition\nto the Antarctic in 1928 with the understanding\nthat ranges of icy mountains would be named after them;\nand Victor Hugo aspired to have nothing less than the\ncity of Paris renamed in his honor. Even Shakespeare,\nmightiest of the mighty, tried to add luster to his name\nby procuring a coat of arms for his family.\nPeople sometimes became invalids in order to win\nsympathy and attention, and get a feeling of importance.\nFor example, take Mrs. McKinley. She got a feeling of\nimportance by forcing her husband, the President of the\nUnited States, to neglect important affairs of state while\nhe reclined on the bed beside her for hours at a time, his\narm about her, soothing her to sleep. She fed her gnawing\ndesire for attention by insisting that he remain with\nher while she was having her teeth fixed, and once created\na stormy scene when he had to leave her alone with\nthe dentist while he kept an appointment with John\nHay, his secretary of state.\nThe writer Mary Roberts Rinehart once told me of a\nbright, vigorous young woman who became an invalid\nin order to get a feeling of importance. \u201cOne day,\u201d said\nMrs. Rinehart, \u201cthis woman had been obliged to face\nsomething, her age perhaps. The lonely years were\nstretching ahead and there was little left for her to anticipate.\n\u201cShe took to her bed; and for ten years her old mother\ntraveled to the third floor and back, carrying trays, nursing\nher. Then one day the old mother, weary with service,\nlay down and died. For some weeks, the invalid\nlanguished; then she got up, put on her clothing, and\nresumed living again.\u201d\nSome authorities declare that people may actually go\ninsane in order to find, in the dreamland of insanity, the\nfeeling of importance that has been denied them in the\nharsh world of reality. There are more patients suffering\nfrom mental diseases in the United States than from all\nother diseases combined.\nWhat is the cause of insanity?\nNobody can answer such a sweeping question, but we\nknow that certain diseases, such as syphilis, break down\nand destroy the brain cells and result in insanity. In fact,\nabout one-half of all mental diseases can be attributed to\nsuch physical causes as brain lesions, alcohol, toxins and\ninjuries. But the other half - and this is the appalling\npart of the story - the other half of the people who go\ninsane apparently have nothing organically wrong with\ntheir brain cells. In post-mortem examinations, when\ntheir brain tissues are studied under the highest-powered\nmicroscopes, these tissues are found to be apparently\njust as healthy as yours and mine.\nWhy do these people go insane?\nI put that question to the head physician of one of our\nmost important psychiatric hospitals. This doctor, who\nhas received the highest honors and the most coveted\nawards for his knowledge of this subject, told me frankly\nthat he didn\u2019t know why people went insane. Nobody\nknows for sure But he did say that many people who go\ninsane find in insanity a feeling of importance that they\nwere unable to achieve in the world of reality. Then he\ntold me this story:\n"I have a patient right now whose marriage proved to\nbe a tragedy. She wanted love, sexual gratification, children\nand social prestige, but life blasted all her hopes.\nHer husband didn\u2019t love her. He refused even to eat\nwith her and forced her to serve his meals in his room\nupstairs. She had no children, no social standing. She\nwent insane; and, in her imagination, she divorced her\nhusband and resumed her maiden name. She now believes\nshe has married into English aristocracy, and she\ninsists on being called Lady Smith.\n\u201cAnd as for children, she imagines now that she has\nhad a new child every night. Each time I call on her she\nsays: \u2018Doctor, I had a baby last night.\u2019 "\nLife once wrecked all her dream ships on the sharp\nrocks of reality; but in the sunny, fantasy isles of insanity,\nall her barkentines race into port with canvas billowing\nand winds singing through the masts.\n" Tragic? Oh, I don\u2019t know. Her physician said to me:\nIf I could stretch out my hand and restore her sanity, I\nwouldn\u2019t do it. She\u2019s much happier as she is."\nIf some people are so hungry for a feeling of importance\nthat they actually go insane to get it, imagine what\nmiracle you and I can achieve by giving people honest\nappreciation this side of insanity.\nOne of the first people in American business to be\npaid a salary of over a million dollars a year (when there\nwas no income tax and a person earning fifty dollars a\nweek was considered well off) was Charles Schwab, He\nhad been picked by Andrew Carnegie to become the\nfirst president of the newly formed United States Steel\nCompany in 1921, when Schwab was only thirty-eight\nyears old. (Schwab later left U.S. Steel to take over the\nthen-troubled Bethlehem Steel Company, and he rebuilt\nit into one of the most profitable companies in America.)\nWhy did Andrew Carnegie pay a million dollars a\nyear, or more than three thousand dollars a day, to\nCharles Schwab? Why? Because Schwab was a genius?\nNo. Because he knew more about the manufacture of\nsteel than other people? Nonsense. Charles Schwab told\nme himself that he had many men working for him who\nknew more about the manufacture of steel than he did.\nSchwab says that he was paid this salary largely because\nof his ability to deal with people. I asked him how\nhe did it. Here is his secret set down in his own words')),(0,o.kt)("ul",null,(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},'words that ought to be cast in eternal bronze and hung\nin every home and school, every shop and office in the\nland - words that children ought to memorize instead of\nwasting their time memorizing the conjugation of Latin\nverbs or the amount of the annual rainfall in Brazil - words\nthat will all but transform your life and mine if we\nwill only live them:\n\u201cI consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my\npeople,\u201d said Schwab, \u201cthe greatest asset I possess, and\nthe way to develop the best that is in a person is by\nappreciation and encouragement.\n\u201cThere is nothing else that so kills the ambitions of a\nperson as criticisms from superiors. I never criticize any-\none. I believe in giving a person incentive to work. So I\nam anxious to praise but loath to find fault. If I like anything,\nI am hearty in my approbation and lavish in my\npraise. "\nThat is what Schwab did. But what do average people\ndo? The exact opposite. If they don\u2019t like a thing, they\nbawl out their subordinates; if they do like it, they say\nnothing. As the old couplet says: \u201cOnce I did bad and\nthat I heard ever/Twice I did good, but that I heard\nnever.\u201d\n\u201cIn my wide association in life, meeting with many\nand great people in various parts of the world,\u201d Schwab\ndeclared, \u201cI have yet to find the person, however great\nor exalted his station, who did not do better work and\nput forth greater effort under a spirit of approval than he\nwould ever do under a spirit of criticism.\u201d\nThat he said, frankly, was one of the outstanding reasons\nfor the phenomenal success of Andrew Carnegie.\nCarnegie praised his associates publicly as well as pr-vately.\nCarnegie wanted to praise his assistants even on his\ntombstone. He wrote an epitaph for himself which read:\n\u201cHere lies one who knew how to get around him men\nwho were cleverer than himself:\u201d\nSincere appreciation was one of the secrets of the first\nJohn D. Rockefeller\u2019s success in handling men. For example,\nwhen one of his partners, Edward T. Bedford,\nlost a million dollars for the firm by a bad buy in South\nAmerica, John D. might have criticized; but he knew\nBedford had done his best - and the incident was\nclosed. So Rockefeller found something to praise; he\ncongratulated Bedford because he had been able to save\n60 percent of the money he had invested. \u201cThat\u2019s splendid,"\nsaid Rockefeller. \u201cWe don\u2019t always do as well as\nthat upstairs.\u201d\nI have among my clippings a story that I know never\nhappened, but it illustrates a truth, so I\u2019ll repeat it:\nAccording to this silly story, a farm woman, at the end\nof a heavy day\u2019s work, set before her menfolks a heaping\npile of hay. And when they indignantly demanded\nwhether she had gone crazy, she replied: \u201cWhy, how\ndid I know you\u2019d notice? I\u2019ve been cooking for you men\nfor the last twenty years and in all that time I ain\u2019t heard\nno word to let me know you wasn\u2019t just eating hay.\u201d\nWhen a study was made a few years ago on runaway\nwives, what do you think was discovered to be the main\nreason wives ran away? It was \u201clack of appreciation.\u201d\nAnd I\u2019d bet that a similar study made of runaway husbands\nwould come out the same way. We often take our\nspouses so much for granted that we never let them\nknow we appreciate them.\nA member of one of our classes told of a request made\nby his wife. She and a group of other women in her\nchurch were involved in a self-improvement program.\nShe asked her husband to help her by listing six things\nhe believed she could do to help her become a better\nwife. He reported to the class: \u201cI was surprised by such\na request. Frankly, it would have been easy for me to list\nsix things I would like to change about her - my heavens,\nshe could have listed a thousand things she would\nlike to change about me - but I didn\u2019t. I said to her, \u2018Let\nme think about it and give you an answer in the morning.\u2019\n\u201cThe next morning I got up very early and called the\nflorist and had them send six red roses to my wife with a\nnote saying: \u2018I can\u2019t think of six things I would like to\nchange about you. I love you the way you are.\u2019\n\u201cWhen I arrived at home that evening, who do you\nthink greeted me at the door: That\u2019s right. My wife! She\nwas almost in tears. Needless to say, I was extremely\nglad I had not criticized her as she had requested.\n\u201cThe following Sunday at church, after she had reported\nthe results of her assignment, several women\nwith whom she had been studying came up to me and\nsaid, \u2018That was the most considerate thing I have ever\nheard.\u2019 It was then I realized the power of appreciation.\u201d\nFlorenz Ziegfeld, the most spectacular producer who\never dazzled Broadway, gained his reputation by his\nsubtle ability to \u201cglorify the American girl.\u201d Time after\ntime, he took drab little creatures that no one ever\nlooked at twice and transformed them on the stage into\nglamorous visions of mystery and seduction. Knowing\nthe value of appreciation and confidence, he made\nwomen feel beautiful by the sheer power of his gallantry\nand consideration. He was practical: he raised the salary\nof chorus girls from thirty dollars a week to as high as\none hundred and seventy-five. And he was also chivalrous;\non opening night at the Follies, he sent telegrams\nto the stars in the cast, and he deluged every chorus girl\nin the show with American Beauty roses.\nI once succumbed to the fad of fasting and went for six\ndays and nights without eating. It wasn\u2019t difficult. I was\nless hungry at the end of the sixth day than I was at the\nend of the second. Yet I know, as you know, people who\nwould think they had committed a crime if they let their\nfamilies or employees go for six days without food; but\nthey will let them go for six days, and six weeks, and\nsometimes sixty years without giving them the hearty\nappreciation that they crave almost as much as they\ncrave food.\nWhen Alfred Lunt, one of the great actors of his time,\nplayed the leading role in Reunion in Vienna,he said,\n\u201cThere is nothing I need so much as nourishment for my\nself-esteem.\u201d\nWe nourish the bodies of our children and friends and\nemployees, but how seldom do we nourish their selfesteem?\nWe provide them with roast beef and potatoes\nto build energy, but we neglect to give them kind words\nof appreciation that would sing in their memories for\nyears like the music of the morning stars.\nPaul Harvey, in one of his radio broadcasts, \u201cThe Rest\nof the Story,\u201d told how showing sincere appreciation can\nchange a person\u2019s life. He reported that years ago a\nteacher in Detroit asked Stevie Morris to help her find a\nmouse that was lost in the classroom. You see, she appreciated\nthe fact that nature had given Stevie something\nno one else in the room had. Nature had given Stevie a\nremarkable pair of ears to compensate for his blind eyes.\nBut this was really the first time Stevie had been shown\nappreciation for those talented ears. Now, years later, he\nsays that this act of appreciation was the beginning of a\nnew life. You see, from that time on he developed his\ngift of hearing and went on to become, under the stage\nname of Stevie Wonder, one of the great pop singers and\nand songwriters of the seventies.*')),(0,o.kt)("ul",null,(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},'Paul Aurandt, Paul Harvey\u2019s The Rest the Story (New York: Doubleday,\n1977).

It doesn\u2019t work - not with intelligent people.\u201d\nOf course flattery seldom works with discerning people.\nIt is shallow, selfish and insincere. It ought to fail\nand it usually does. True, some people are so hungry, so\nthirsty, for appreciation that they will swallow anything,\njust as a starving man will eat grass and fishworms.\nEven Queen Victoria was susceptible to flattery.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Disraeli confessed that he put\nit on thick in dealing with the Queen. To use his exact\nwords, he said he \u201cspread it on with a trowel.\u201d But Disraeli\nwas one of the most polished, deft and adroit men\nwho ever ruled the far-flung British Empire. He was a\ngenius in his line. What would work for him wouldn\u2019t\nnecessarily work for you and me. In the long run, flattery\nwill do you more harm than good. Flattery is counterfeit,\nand like counterfeit money, it will eventually get you\ninto trouble if you pass it to someone else.\nThe difference between appreciation and flattery?\nThat is simple. One is sincere and the other insincere.\nOne comes from the heart out; the other from the teeth\nout. One is unselfish; the other selfish. One is universally\nadmired; the other universally condemned.\nI recently saw a bust of Mexican hero General Alvaro\nObregon in the Chapultepec palace in Mexico City.\nBelow the bust are carved these wise words from General\nObregon\u2019s philosophy: \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of enemies\nwho attack you. Be afraid of the friends who flatter you.\u201d\nNo! No! No! I am not suggesting flattery! Far from it.\nI\u2019m talking about a new way of life. Let me repeat.

One of\nthese maxims said: \u201cTeach me neither to proffer nor receive\ncheap praise.\u201d That\u2019s all flattery is - cheap praise.\nI once read a definition of flattery that may be worth\nrepeating: \u201cFlattery is telling the other person precisely\nwhat he thinks about himself.\u201d\n\u201cUse what language you will,\u201d said Ralph Waldo\nEmerson, \u201cyou can never say anything but what you\nare ."\nIf all we had to do was flatter, everybody would catch\non and we should all be experts in human relations.\nWhen we are not engaged in thinking about some definite\nproblem, we usually spend about 95 percent of our\ntime thinking about ourselves. Now, if we stop thinking\nabout ourselves for a while and begin to think of the\nother person\u2019s good points, we won\u2019t have to resort to\nflattery so cheap and false that it can be spotted almost\nbefore it is out of the mouth,\nOne of the most neglected virtues of our daily existence\nis appreciation, Somehow, we neglect to praise\nour son or daughter when he or she brings home a good\nreport card, and we fail to encourage our children when\nthey first succeed in baking a cake or building a birdhouse.\nNothing pleases children more than this kind of\nparental interest and approval.\nThe next time you enjoy filet mignon at the club, send\nword to the chef that it was excellently prepared, and\nwhen a tired salesperson shows you unusual courtesy,\nplease mention it.\nEvery minister, lecturer and public speaker knows the\ndiscouragement of pouring himself or herself out to an\naudience and not receiving a single ripple of appreciative\ncomment. What applies to professionals applies\ndoubly to workers in offices, shops and factories and our\nfamilies and friends. In our interpersonal relations we\nshould never forget that all our associates are human\nbeings and hunger for appreciation. It is the legal tender\nthat all souls enjoy.\nTry leaving a friendly trail of little sparks of gratitude\non your daily trips.

The other employees\nwould jeer at him and litter the hallways to show\nhim what a bad job he was doing. It was so bad, productive\ntime was being lost in the shop.\nWithout success, Pam tried various ways to motivate\nthis person. She noticed that occasionally he did a particularly\ngood piece of work. She made a point to praise\nhim for it in front of the other people. Each day the job\nhe did all around got better, and pretty soon he started\ndoing all his work efficiently. Now he does an excellent\njob and other people give him appreciation and recognition.\nHonest appreciation got results where criticism\nand ridicule failed.\nHurting people not only does not change them, it is\nnever called for. There is an old saying that I have cut\nout and pasted on my mirror where I cannot help but\nsee it every day:\nI shall pass this way but once; any good, therefore, that I\ncan do or any kindness that I can show to any human being,\nlet me do it now. Let me not defer nor neglect it, for I shall\nnot pass this way again.\nEmerson said: \u201cEvery man I meet is my superior in\nsome way, In that, I learn of him.\u201d\nIf that was true of Emerson, isn\u2019t it likely to be a thousand\ntimes more true of you and me?

So when I went fishing, I didn\u2019t think about what\nI wanted. I thought about what they wanted. I didn\u2019t\nbait the hook with strawberries and cream. Rather, I dangled\na worm or a grasshopper in front of the fish and\nsaid: \u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to have that?\u201d\nWhy not use the same common sense when fishing for\npeople?\nThat is what Lloyd George, Great Britain\u2019s Prime Minister\nduring World War I, did. When someone asked him\nhow he managed to stay in power after the other wartime\nleaders - Wilson, Orlando and Clemenceau - had been\nforgotten, he replied that if his staying on top might be\nattributed to any one thing, it would be to his having\nlearned that it was necessary to bait the hook to suit the\nfish .\nWhy talk about what we want? That is childish. Absurd.\nOf course, you are interested in what you want.\nYou are eternally interested in it. But no one else is. The\nrest of us are just like you: we are interested in what we\nwant.So the only way cm earth to influence other people is\nto talk about what they want and show them how to get\nit.\nRemember that tomorrow when you are trying to get\nsomebody to do something. If, for example, you don\u2019t\nwant your children to smoke, don\u2019t preach at them, and\ndon\u2019t talk about what you want; but show them that cigarettes\nmay keep them from making the basketball team\nor winning the hundred-yard dash.\nThis is a good thing to remember regardless of\nwhether you are dealing with children or calves or chimpanzees.\nFor example: one day Ralph Waldo Emerson\nand his son tried to get a calf into the barn. But they\nmade the common mistake of thinking only of what they\nwanted: Emerson pushed and his son pulled. But the\ncalf was doing just what they were doing; he was thinking\nonly of what he wanted; so he stiffened his legs and\nstubbornly refused to leave the pasture. The Irish housemaid\nsaw their predicament. She couldn\u2019t write essays\nand books; but, on this occasion at least, she had more\nhorse sense, or calf sense, than Emerson had. She\nthought of what the calf wanted; so she put her maternal\nfinger in the calf\u2019s mouth and let the calf suck her finger\nas she gently led him into the barn.\nEvery act you have ever performed since the day you\nwere born was performed because you wanted something.\nHow about the time you gave a large contribution\nto the Red Cross? Yes, that is no exception to the rule.\nYou gave the Red Cross the donation because you\nwanted to lend a helping hand; you wanted to do a beautiful,\nunselfish, divine act. " Inasmuch as ye have done it\nunto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done\nit unto me.\u201d\nIf you hadn\u2019t wanted that feeling more than you\nwanted your money, you would not have made the contribution.\nOf course, you might have made the contribution\nbecause you were ashamed to refuse or because a\ncustomer asked you to do it. But one thing is certain. You\nmade the contribution because you wanted something.\nHarry A, Overstreet in his illuminating book Influencing\nHuman Behavior said; \u201cAction springs out of what\nwe fundamentally desire . . . and the best piece of advice\nwhich can be given to would-be persuaders,\nwhether in business, in the home, in the school, in politics,\nis: First, arouse in the other person an eager want.\nHe who can do this has the whole world with him. He\nwho cannot walks a lonely way.\u201d\nAndrew Carnegie, the poverty-stricken Scotch lad\nwho started to work at two cents an hour and finally gave\naway $365 million, learned early in life that the only\nway to influence people is to talk in terms of what the\nother person wants. He attended school only four years;\nyet he learned how to handle people.\nTo illustrate: His sister-in-law was worried sick over\nher two boys. They were at Yale, and they were so busy\nwith their own affairs that they neglected to write home\nand paid no attention whatever to their mother\u2019s frantic\nletters.\nThen Carnegie offered to wager a hundred dollars that\nhe could get an answer by return mail, without even\nasking for it. Someone called his bet; so he wrote his\nnephews a chatty letter, mentioning casually in a post-script\nthat he was sending each one a five-dollar bill.\nHe neglected, however, to enclose the money.\nBack came replies by return mail thanking \u201cDear\nUncle Andrew\u201d for his kind note and-you can finish\nthe sentence yourself.\nAnother example of persuading comes from Stan\nNovak of Cleveland, Ohio, a participant in our course.\nStan came home from work one evening to find his\nyoungest son, Tim, kicking and screaming on the living\nroom floor. He was to start kindergarten the next day and\nwas protesting that he would not go. Stan\u2019s normal reaction\nwould have been to banish the child to his room\nand tell him he\u2019d just better make up his mind to go. He\nhad no choice. But tonight, recognizing that this would\nnot really help Tim start kindergarten in the best frame\nof mind, Stan sat down and thought, \u201cIf I were Tim, why\nwould I be excited about going to kindergarten?\u201d He\nand his wife made a list of all the fun things Tim would\ndo such as finger painting, singing songs, making new\nfriends. Then they put them into action. \u201cWe all started\nfinger-painting on the kitchen table-my wife, Lil, my\nother son Bob, and myself, all having fun. Soon Tim was\npeeping around the corner. Next he was begging to participate.\n\u2018Oh, no! You have to go to kindergarten first to\nlearn how to finger-paint.\u2019 With all the enthusiasm I\ncould muster I went through the list talking in terms he\ncould understand-telling him all the fun he would\nhave in kindergarten. The next morning, I thought I was\nthe first one up. I went downstairs and found Tim sitting\nsound asleep in the living room chair. \u2018What are you\ndoing here?\u2019 I asked. \u2018I\u2019m waiting to go to kindergarten.\nI don\u2019t want to be late.\u2019 The enthusiasm of our entire\nfamily had aroused in Tim an eager want that no amount\nof discussion or threat could have possibly accomplished.\u201d\nTomorrow you may want to persuade somebody to do\nsomething. Before you speak, pause and ask yourself:\n\u201cHow can I make this person want to do it?\u201d\nThat question will stop us from rushing into a situation\nheedlessly, with futile chatter about our desires.\nAt one time I rented the grand ballroom of a certain\nNew York hotel for twenty nights in each season in order\nto hold a series of lectures.\nAt the beginning of one season, I was suddenly informed\nthat I should have to pay almost three times as\nmuch rent as formerly. This news reached me after the\ntickets had been printed and distributed and all announcements\nhad been made.\nNaturally, I didn\u2019t want to pay the increase, but what\nwas the use of talking to the hotel about what I wanted?\nThey were interested only in what they wanted. So a\ncouple of days later I went to see the manager.\n"I was a bit shocked when I got your letter,\u201d I said,\n\u201cbut I don\u2019t blame you at all. If I had been in your position,\nI should probably have written a similar letter myself.\nYour duty as the manager of the hotel is to make all\nthe profit possible. If you don\u2019t do that, you will be fired\nand you ought to be fired. Now, let\u2019s take a piece of\npaper and write down the advantages and the disadvantages\nthat will accrue to you, if you insist on this increase\nin rent.\u201d\nThen I took a letterhead and ran a line through the\ncenter and headed one column \u201cAdvantages\u201d and the\nother column \u201cDisadvantages.\u201d\nI wrote down under the head \u201cAdvantages\u201d these\nwords: \u201cBallroom free.\u201d Then I went on to say: \u201cYou\nwill have the advantage of having the ballroom free to\nrent for dances and conventions. That is a big advantage,\nfor affairs like that will pay you much more than you can\nget for a series of lectures. If I tie your ballroom up\nfor twenty nights during the course of the season, it is\nsure to mean a loss of some very profitable business to\nyou.\n\u201cNow, let\u2019s \u2018consider the disadvantages. First, instead\nof increasing your income from me, you are going to\ndecrease it. In fact, you are going to wipe it out because\nI cannot pay the rent you are asking. I shall be forced to\nhold these lectures at some other place.\n\u201cThere\u2019s another disadvantage to you also. These lectures\nattract crowds of educated and cultured people to\nyour hotel. That is good advertising for you, isn\u2019t it? In\nfact, if you spent five thousand dollars advertising in the\nnewspapers, you couldn\u2019t bring as many people to look\nat your hotel as I can bring by these lectures. That is\nworth a lot to a hotel, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nAs I talked, I wrote these two \u201cdisadvantages\u201d under\nthe proper heading, and handed the sheet of paper to\nthe manager, saying: "I wish you would carefully consider\nboth the advantages and disadvantages that are\ngoing to accrue to you and then give me your final decision.\u201d\nI received a letter the next day, informing me that my\nrent would be increased only 50 percent instead of 300\npercent.\nMind you, I got this reduction without saying a word\nabout what I wanted. I talked all the time about what\nthe other person wanted and how he could get it.\nSuppose I had done the human, natural thing; suppose\nI had stormed into his office and said, \u201cWhat do you\nmean by raising my rent three hundred percent when\nyou know the tickets have been printed and the announcements\nmade? Three hundred percent! Ridiculous!\nAbsurd! I won\u2019t pay it!\u201d\nWhat would have happened then? An argument would\nhave begun to steam and boil and sputter - and you\nknow how arguments end. Even if I had convinced him\nthat he was wrong, his pride would have made it difficult\nfor him to back down and give in.\nHere is one of the best bits of advice ever given about\nthe fine art of human relationships. \u201cIf there is any one\nsecret of success,\u201d said Henry Ford, \u201cit lies in the ability\nto get the other person\u2019s point of view and see things\nfrom that person\u2019s angle as well as from your own.\u201d\nThat is so good, I want to repeat it:"If there is any one\nsecret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other\nperson\'s point of view and see things from that person\u2019s\nangle as well as from your own.\u201d\nThat is so simple, so obvious, that anyone ought to see\nthe truth of it at a glance; yet 90 percent of the people\non this earth ignore it 90 percent of the time.\nAn example? Look at the letters that come across your\ndesk tomorrow morning, and you will find that most of\nthem violate this important canon of common sense.\nTake this one, a letter written by the head of the radio\ndepartment of an advertising agency with offices scattered\nacross the continent.

Zerega\u2019s Sons, Inc.\n28 Front St.\nBrooklyn, N.Y. 11201\nAttention: Mr. Edward Vermylen\nGentlemen:\nThe operations at our outbound-rail-receiving station are\nhandicapped because a material percentage of the total\nbusiness is delivered us in the late afternoon. This condition\nresults in congestion, overtime on the part of our forces,\ndelays to trucks, and in some cases delays to freight. On\nNovember 10, we received from your company a lot of 510\npieces, which reached here at 4:20 P.M.\nWe solicit your cooperation toward overcoming the undesirable\neffects arising from late receipt of freight. May we\nask that, on days on which you ship the volume which was\nreceived on the above date, effort be made either to get the\ntruck here earlier or to deliver us part of the freight during\nthe morning?\nThe advantage that would accrue to you under such an\narrangement would be that of more expeditious discharge\nof your trucks and the assurance that your business would\ngo forward on the date of its receipt.\nVery truly yours,\nJ----- B ----- Supt.\nAfter reading this letter, Mr. Vermylen, sales manager\nfor A. Zerega\u2019s Sons, Inc., sent it to me with the following\ncomment:\nThis letter had the reverse effect from that which was\nintended. The letter begins by describing the Terminal\u2019s\ndifficulties, in which we are not interested, generally speaking.\nOur cooperation is then requested without any thought\nas to whether it would inconvenience us, and then, finally,\nin the last paragraph, the fact is mentioned that if we do\ncooperate it will mean more expeditious discharge of our\ntrucks with the assurance that our freight will go forward on\nthe date of its receipt.\nIn other words, that in which we are most interested is\nmentioned last and the whole effect is one of raising a spirit\nof antagonism rather than of cooperation.\nLet\u2019s see if we can\u2019t rewrite and improve this letter.\nLet\u2019s not waste any time talking about our problems. As\nHenry Ford admonishes, let\u2019s \u201cget the other person\u2019s\npoint of view and see things from his or her angle, as\nwell as from our own.\u201d\nHere is one way of revising the letter.

Naturally, we are very grateful for your patronage\nand are eager to give you the speedy, efficient service\nyou deserve. However, we regret to say that it isn\u2019t\npossible for us to do that when your trucks bring us a large\nshipment late in the afternoon, as they did on November")),(0,o.kt)("ol",{start:10},(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Why? Because many other customers make late afternoon\ndeliveries also. Naturally, that causes congestion.

If you make your deliveries\nat the pier in the morning when possible, your trucks\nwill be able to keep moving, your freight will get immediate\nattention, and our workers will get home early at night to\nenjoy a dinner of the delicious macaroni and noodles that\nyou manufacture.\nRegardless of when your shipments arrive, we shall always\ncheerfully do all in our power to serve you promptly.\nYou are busy.

Using the principles she had\nlearned in our course, she wrote the following letter to\ntwelve banks in Phoenix:\nDear Sir:\nMy ten years of bank experience should be of interest to\na rapidly growing bank like yours.\nIn various capacities in bank operations with the Bankers\nTrust Company in New York, leading to my present assignment\nas Branch Manager, I have acquired skills in all\nphases of banking including depositor relations, credits,\nloans and administration.\nI will be relocating to Phoenix in May and I am sure I can\ncontribute to your growth and profit. I will be in Phoenix\nthe week of April 3 and would appreciate the opportunity\nto show you how I can help your bank meet its goals.\nSincerely,\nBarbara L. Anderson\nDo you think Mrs. Anderson received any response\nfrom that letter? Eleven of the twelve banks invited her\nto be interviewed, and she had a choice of which bank\u2019s\noffer to accept. Why? Mrs. Anderson did not state what\nshe wanted, but wrote in the letter how she could help\nthem, and focused on their wants, not her own.\nThousands of salespeople are pounding the pavements\ntoday, tired, discouraged and underpaid. Why?\nBecause they are always thinking only of what they\nwant. They don\u2019t realize that neither you nor I want to\nbuy anything. If we did, we would go out and buy it. But\nboth of us are eternally interested in solving our problems.\nAnd if salespeople can show us how their services\nor merchandise will help us solve our problems, they\nwon\u2019t need to sell us. We\u2019ll buy. And customers like to\nfeel that they are buying - not being sold.\nYet many salespeople spend a lifetime in selling without\nseeing things from the customer\u2019s angle. For example,\nfor many years I lived in Forest Hills, a little\ncommunity of private homes in the center of Greater\nNew York. One day as I was rushing to the station, I\nchanced to meet a real-estate operator who had bought\nand sold property in that area for many years. He knew\nForest Hills well, so I hurriedly asked him whether or\nnot my stucco house was built with metal lath or hollow\ntile. He said he didn\u2019t know and told me what I already\nknew - that I could find out by calling the Forest Hills\nGarden Association. The following morning, I received\na letter from him. Did he give me the information I\nwanted? He could have gotten it in sixty seconds by a\ntelephone call. But he didn\u2019t. He told me again that I\ncould get it by telephoning, and then asked me to let\nhim handle my insurance.\nHe was not interested in helping me. He was interested\nonly in helping himself.\nJ. Howard Lucas of Birmingham, Alabama, tells how\ntwo salespeople from the same company handled the\nsame type of situation, He reported:\n\u201cSeveral years ago I was on the management team of\na small company. Headquartered near us was the district\noffice of a large insurance company. Their agents were\nassigned territories, and our company was assigned to\ntwo agents, whom I shall refer to as Carl and John.\n\u201cOne morning, Carl dropped by our office and casually\nmentioned that his company had just introduced a\nnew life insurance policy for executives and thought we\nmight be interested later on and he would get back to us\nwhen he had more information on it.\n\u201cThe same day, John saw us on the sidewalk while\nreturning from a coffee break, and he shouted: \u2018Hey\nLuke, hold up, I have some great news for you fellows.\u2019\nHe hurried over and very excitedly told us about an executive\nlife insurance policy his company had introduced\nthat very day. (It was the same policy that Carl\nhad casually mentioned.) He wanted us to have one of\nthe first issued. He gave us a few important facts about\nthe coverage and ended saying, \u2018The policy is so new,\nI\u2019m going to have someone from the home office come\nout tomorrow and explain it. Now, in the meantime, let\u2019s\nget the applications signed and on the way so he can\nhave more information to work with.\u2019 His enthusiasm\naroused in us an eager want for this policy even though\nwe still did not have details, When they were made\navailable to us, they confirmed John\u2019s initial understanding\nof the policy, and he not only sold each of us a policy,\nbut later doubled our coverage.\n\u201cCarl could have had those sales, but he made no effort\nto arouse in us any desire for the policies.\u201d\nThe world is full of people who are grabbing and self-seeking.\nSo the rare individual who unselfishly tries to\nserve others has an enormous advantage. He has little\ncompetition. Owen D. Young, a noted lawyer and one of\nAmerica\u2019s great business leaders, once said: \u201cPeople\nwho can put themselves in the place of other people\nwho can understand the workings of their minds, need\nnever worry about what the future has in store for\nthem.\u201d\nIf out of reading this book you get just one thing - an\nincreased tendency to think always in terms of other\npeople\u2019s point of view, and see things from their angle")),(0,o.kt)("ul",null,(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},'if you get that one thing out of this book, it may\neasily prove to be one of the building blocks of your\ncareer.\nLooking at the other person\u2019s point of view and arousing\nin him an eager want for something is not to be\nconstrued as manipulating that person so that he will do\nsomething that is only for your benefit and his detriment.\nEach party should gain from the negotiation. In the letters\nto Mr. Vermylen, both the sender and the receiver\nof the correspondence gained by implementing what\nwas suggested. Both the bank and Mrs. Anderson won\nby her letter in that the bank obtained a valuable employee\nand Mrs. Anderson a suitable job. And in the\nexample of John\u2019s sale of insurance to Mr. Lucas, both\ngained through this transaction.\nAnother example in which everybody gains through\nthis principle of arousing an eager want comes from Michael\nE. Whidden of Warwick, Rhode Island, who is a\nterritory salesman for the Shell Oil Company. Mike\nwanted to become the Number One salesperson in his\ndistrict, but one service station was holding him back. It\nwas run by an older man who could not be motivated to\nclean up his station. It was in such poor shape that sales\nwere declining significantly.\nThis manager would not listen to any of Mike\u2019s pleas\nto upgrade the station. After many exhortations and\nheart-to-heart talks - all of which had no impact - Mike\ndecided to invite the manager to visit the newest Shell\nstation in his territory.\nThe manager was so impressed by the facilities at the\nnew station that when Mike visited him the next time,\nhis station was cleaned up and had recorded a sales increase.\nThis enabled Mike to reach the Number One\nspot in his district. All his talking and discussion hadn\u2019t\nhelped, but by arousing an eager want in the manager,\nby showing him the modern station, he had accomplished\nhis goal, and both the manager and Mike benefited.\nMost people go through college and learn to read Virgil\nand master the mysteries of calculus without ever\ndiscovering how their own minds function. For instance:\nI once gave a course in Effective Speaking for the young\ncollege graduates who were entering the employ of the\nCarrier Corporation, the large air-conditioner manufacturer.\nOne of the participants wanted to persuade the\nothers to play basketball in their free time, and this is\nabout what he said: "I want you to come out and play\nbasketball. I like to play basketball, but the last few\ntimes I\u2019ve been to the gymnasium there haven\u2019t been\nenough people to get up a game. Two or three of us got\nto throwing the ball around the other night - and I got a\nblack eye. I wish all of you would come down tomorrow\nnight. I want to play basketball.\u201d\nDid he talk about anything you want? You don\u2019t want\nto go to a gymnasium that no one else goes to, do you?\nYou don\u2019t care about what he wants. You don\u2019t want to\nget a black eye.\nCould he have shown you how to get the things you\nwant by using the gymnasium? Surely. More pep.\nKeener edge to the appetite. Clearer brain. Fun. Games.\nBasketball.\nTo repeat Professor Overstreet\u2019s wise advice: First,\narouse in the other person an eager want He who can\ndo this has the whole world with him. He who cannot\nwalks a lonely way.\nOne of the students in the author\u2019s training course was\nworried about his little boy. The child was underweight\nand refused to eat properly. His parents used the usual\nmethod. They scolded and nagged. \u201cMother wants you\nto eat this and that.\u201d "Father wants you to grow up to be\na big man.\u201d\nDid the boy pay any attention to these pleas? Just\nabout as much as you pay to one fleck of sand on a sandy\nbeach.\nNo one with a trace of horse sense would expect a\nchild three years old to react to the viewpoint of a father\nthirty years old. Yet that was precisely what that father\nhad expected. It was absurd. He finally saw that. So he\nsaid to himself: \u201cWhat does that boy want? How can I\ntie up what I want to what he wants?\u201d\nIt was easy for the father when he starting thinking\nabout it. His boy had a tricycle that he loved to ride up\nand down the sidewalk in front of the house in Brooklyn.\nA few doors down the street lived a bully - a bigger boy\nwho would pull the little boy off his tricycle and ride it\nhimself.\nNaturally, the little boy would run screaming to his\nmother, and she would have to come out and take the\nbully off the tricycle and put her little boy on again, This\nhappened almost every day.\nWhat did the little boy want? It didn\u2019t take a Sherlock\nHolmes to answer that one. His pride, his anger, his\ndesire for a feeling of importance - all the strongest\nemotions in his makeup - goaded him to get revenge, to\nsmash the bully in the nose. And when his father explained\nthat the boy would be able to wallop the daylights\nout of the bigger kid someday if he would only eat\nthe things his mother wanted him to eat - when his father\npromised him that - there was no longer any problem\nof dietetics. That boy would have eaten spinach,\nsauerkraut, salt mackerel - anything in order to be big\nenough to whip the bully who had humiliated him so\noften.\nAfter solving that problem, the parents tackled another:\nthe little boy had the unholy habit of wetting his bed.\nHe slept with his grandmother. In the morning, his\ngrandmother would wake up and feel the sheet and say:\n\u201cLook, Johnny, what you did again last night.\u201d\nHe would say: \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t do it. You did it.\u201d\nScolding, spanking, shaming him, reiterating that the\nparents didn\u2019t want him to do it - none of these things\nkept the bed dry. So the parents asked: \u201cHow can we\nmake this boy want to stop wetting his bed?\u201d\nWhat were his wants? First, he wanted to wear pajamas\nlike Daddy instead of wearing a nightgown like\nGrandmother. Grandmother was getting fed up with his\nnocturnal iniquities, so she gladly offered to buy him a\npair of pajamas if he would reform. Second, he wanted a\nbed of his own. Grandma didn\u2019t object.\nHis mother took him to a department store in Brooklyn,\nwinked at the salesgirl, and said: \u201cHere is a little\ngentleman who would like to do some shopping.\u201d\nThe salesgirl made him feel important by saying:\n\u201cYoung man, what can I show you?\u201d\nHe stood a couple of inches taller and said: \u201cI want to\nbuy a bed for myself.\u201d\nWhen he was shown the one his mother wanted him\nto buy, she winked at the salesgirl and the boy was persuaded\nto buy it.\nThe bed was delivered the next day; and that night,\nwhen Father came home, the little boy ran to the door\nshouting: \u201cDaddy! Daddy!

" Oh, no, no! I am not going to wet this bed.\u201d The boy\nkept his promise, for his pride was involved. That was\nhis bed. He and he alone had bought it. And he was\nwearing pajamas now like a little man. He wanted to act\nlike a man. And he did.\nAnother father, K. T. Dutschmann, a telephone engineer,\na student of this course, couldn\u2019t get his three-year\nold daughter to eat breakfast food. The usual scolding,\npleading, coaxing methods had all ended in futility. So\nthe parents asked themselves: \u201cHow can we make her\nwant to do it?\u201d\nThe little girl loved to imitate her mother, to feel big\nand grown up; so one morning they put her on a chair\nand let her make the breakfast food. At just the psychological\nmoment, Father drifted into the kitchen while\nshe was stirring the cereal and she said: \u201cOh, look,\nDaddy, I am making the cereal this morning.\u201d\nShe ate two helpings of the cereal without any coaxing,\nbecause she was interested in it. She had achieved\na feeling of importance; she had found in making the\ncereal an avenue of self-expression.\nWilliam Winter once remarked that "self-expression is\nthe dominant necessity of human nature.\u201d Why can\u2019t we\nadapt this same psychology to business dealings?

He was the light and\njoy of my childhood. Every afternoon about four-thirty,\nhe would sit in the front yard with his beautiful eyes\nstaring steadfastly at the path, and as soon as he heard\nmy voice or saw me swinging my dinner pail through\nthe buck brush, he was off like a shot, racing breathlessly\nup the hill to greet me with leaps of joy and barks of\nsheer ecstasy.\nTippy was my constant companion for five years.

You knew by some divine instinct that\nyou can make more friends in two months by becoming\ngenuinely interested in other people than you can in two\nyears by trying to get other people interested in you. Let\nme repeat that. You can make more friends in two\nmonths by becoming interested in other people than you\ncan in two years by trying to get other people interested\nin you.\nYet I know and you know people who blunder through\nlife trying to wigwag other people into becoming interested\nin them.\nOf course, it doesn\u2019t work. People are not interested\nin you. They are not interested in me. They are interested\nin themselves - morning, noon and after dinner.\nThe New York Telephone Company made a detailed\nstudy of telephone conversations to find out which word\nis the most frequently used.

In that\nbook he says: \u201cIt is the individual who is not interested\nin his fellow men who has the greatest difficulties in life\nand provides the greatest injury to others. It is from\namong such individuals that all human failures spring.\u201d\nYou may read scores of erudite tomes on psychology\nwithout coming across a statement more significant for\nyou and for me.

It is from umong such individuals\nthat all humun failures spring.\nI once took a course in short-story writing at New York\nUniversity, and during that course the editor of a leading\nmagazine talked to our class. He said he could pick up\nany one of the dozens of stories that drifted across his\ndesk every day and after reading a few paragraphs he\ncould feel whether or not the author liked people. \u201cIf\nthe author doesn\u2019t like people,\u201d he said, \u201cpeople won\u2019t\nlike his or her stories.\u201d\nThis hard-boiled editor stopped twice in the course of\nhis talk on fiction writing and apologized for preaching\na sermon. \u201cI am telling you,\u201d he said, \u201cthe same things\nyour preacher would tell you, but remember, you have\nto be interested in people if you want to be a successful\nwriter of stories.\u201d\nIf that is true of writing fiction, you can be sure it is\ntrue of dealing with people face-to-face.\nI spent an evening in the dressing room of Howard\nThurston the last time he appeared on Broadway -\nThurston was the acknowledged dean of magicians. For forty\nyears he had traveled all over the world, time and again,\ncreating illusions, mystifying audiences, and making\npeople gasp with astonishment. More than 60 million\npeople had paid admission to his show, and he had made\nalmost $2 million in profit.\nI asked Mr. Thurston to tell me the secret of his success.\nHis schooling certainly had nothing to do with it,\nfor he ran away from home as a small boy, became a\nhobo, rode in boxcars, slept in haystacks, begged his\nfood from door to door, and learned to read by looking\nout of boxcars at signs along the railway.\nDid he have a superior knowledge of magic? No, he\ntold me hundreds of books had been written about legerdemain\nand scores of people knew as much about it as\nhe did. But he had two things that the others didn\u2019t have.\nFirst, he had the ability to put his personality across the\nfootlights. He was a master showman. He knew human\nnature. Everything he did, every gesture, every intonation\nof his voice, every lifting of an eyebrow had been\ncarefully rehearsed in advance, and his actions were\ntimed to split seconds. But, in addition to that, Thurston\nhad a genuine interest in people. He told me that many\nmagicians would look at the audience and say to themselves,\n\u201cWell, there is a bunch of suckers out there, a\nbunch of hicks; I\u2019ll fool them all right.\u201d But Thurston\u2019s\nmethod was totally different. He told me that every time\nhe went on stage he said to himself: \u201cI am grateful because\nthese people come to see me, They make it possible\nfor me to make my living in a very agreeable way.\nI\u2019m going to give them the very best I possibly can.\u201d\nHe declared he never stepped in front of the footlights\nwithout first saying to himself over and over: \u201cI love my\naudience. I love my audience.\u201d Ridiculous? Absurd?\nYou are privileged to think anything you like. I am\nmerely passing it on to you without comment as a recipe\nused by one of the most famous magicians of all time.\nGeorge Dyke of North Warren, Pennsylvania, was\nforced to retire from his service station business after\nthirty years when a new highway was constructed over\nthe site of his station. It wasn\u2019t long before the idle days\nof retirement began to bore him, so he started filling in\nhis time trying to play music on his old fiddle. Soon he\nwas traveling the area to listen to music and talk with\nmany of the accomplished fiddlers. In his humble and\nfriendly way he became generally interested in learning\nthe background and interests of every musician he met.\nAlthough he was not a great fiddler himself, he made\nmany friends in this pursuit. He attended competitions\nand soon became known to the country music fans in the\neastern part of the United States as \u201cUncle George, the\nFiddle Scraper from Kinzua County.\u201d When we heard\nUncle George, he was seventy-two and enjoying every\nminute of his life. By having a sustained interest in other\npeople, he created a new life for himself at a time when\nmost people consider their productive years over.\nThat, too, was one of the secrets of Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s\nastonishing popularity. Even his servants loved\nhim. His valet, James E. Amos, wrote a book about him\nentitled Theodore Roosevelt, Hero to His Valet. In that\nbook Amos relates this illuminating incident:\nMy wife one time asked the President about a bobwhite.\nShe had never seen one and he described it to her fully.\nSometime later, the telephone at our cottage rang. ',"[Amos\nand his wife lived in a little cottage on the Roosevelt estate\nat Oyster Bay.]",' My wife answered it and it was Mr. Roosevelt\nhimself. He had called her, he said, to tell her that there\nwas a bobwhite outside her window and that if she would\nlook out she might see it. Little things like that were so\ncharacteristic of him. Whenever he went by our cottage,\neven though we were out of sight, we would hear him call\nout: \u201cOo-oo-oo, Annie?\u201d or \u201cOo-oo-oo, James!\u201d It was just a\nfriendly greeting as he went by.\nHow could employees keep from liking a man like\nthat? How could anyone keep from liking him?\nRoosevelt called at the White House one day when\nthe President and Mrs. Taft were away. His honest liking\nfor humble people was shown by the fact that he\ngreeted all the old White House servants by name, even\nthe scullery maids.\n\u201cWhen he saw Alice, the kitchen maid,\u201d writes Archie\nButt, \u201che asked her if she still made corn bread. Alice\ntold him that she sometimes made it for the servants, but\nno one ate it upstairs.\n"\u2018They show bad taste,\u2019 Roosevelt boomed, \u2018and I\u2019ll\ntell the President so when I see him.\u2019\n\u201cAlice brought a piece to him on a plate, and he went\nover to the office eating it as he went and greeting gardeners\nand laborers as he passed. . .\n\u201cHe addressed each person just as he had addressed\nthem in the past. Ike Hoover, who had been head usher\nat the White House for forty years, said with tears in his\neyes: \u2018It is the only happy day we had in nearly two\nyears, and not one of us would exchange it for a hundred-dollar\nbill.\u2019 \u201d\nThe same concern for the seemingly unimportant people\nhelped sales representative Edward M. Sykes, Jr., of\nChatham, New Jersey, retain an account. \u201cMany years\nago,\u201d he reported, \u201cI called on customers for Johnson\nand Johnson in the Massachusetts area. One account was\na drug store in Hingham. Whenever I went into this\nstore I would always talk to the soda clerk and sales\nclerk for a few minutes before talking to the owner to\nobtain his order. One day I went up to the owner of the\nstore, and he told me to leave as he was not interested in\nbuying J&J products anymore because he felt they were\nconcentrating their activities on food and discount stores\nto the detriment of the small drugstore. I left with my\ntail between my legs and drove around the town for several\nhours. Finally, I decided to go back and try at least\nto explain our position to the owner of the store.\n\u201cWhen I returned I walked in and as usual said hello\nto the soda clerk and sales clerk. When I walked up to\nthe owner, he smiled at me and welcomed me back. He\nthen gave me double the usual order, I looked at him\nwith surprise and asked him what had happened since\nmy visit only a few hours earlier. He pointed to the\nyoung man at the soda fountain and said that after I had\nleft, the boy had come over and said that I was one of the\nfew salespeople that called on the store that even bothered\nto say hello to him and to the others in the store. He\ntold the owner that if any salesperson deserved his business,\nit was I. The owner agreed and remained a loyal\ncustomer. I never forgot that to be genuinely interested\nin other people is a most important quality for a sales-person\nto possess - for any person, for that matter.\u201d\nI have discovered from personal experience that one\ncan win the attention and time and cooperation of even\nthe most sought-after people by becoming genuinely interested\nin them. Let me illustrate.\nYears ago I conducted a course in fiction writing at the\nBrooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, and we wanted\nsuch distinguished and busy authors as Kathleen Norris,\nFannie Hurst, Ida Tarbell, Albert Payson Terhune and\nRupert Hughes to come to Brooklyn and give us the\nbenefit of their experiences. So we wrote them, saying\nwe admired their work and were deeply interested in\ngetting their advice and learning the secrets of their success.\nEach of these letters was signed by about a hundred\nand fifty students. We said we realized that these authors\nwere busy - too busy to prepare a lecture. So we enclosed\na list of questions for them to answer about themselves\nand their methods of work. They liked that. Who\nwouldn\u2019t like it? So they left their homes and traveled to\nBrooklyn to give us a helping hand.\nBy using the same method, I persuaded Leslie M.\nShaw, secretary of the treasury in Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s\ncabinet; George W. Wickersham, attorney general in\nTaft\u2019s cabinet; William Jennings Bryan; Franklin D.\nRoosevelt and many other prominent men to come to\ntalk to the students of my courses in public speaking.\nAll of us, be we workers in a factory, clerks in an office\nor even a king upon his throne - all of us like people\nwho admire us. Take the German Kaiser, for example. At\nthe close of World War I he was probably the most savagely\nand universally despised man on this earth. Even\nhis own nation turned against him when he fled over\ninto Holland to save his neck. The hatred against him\nwas so intense that millions of people would have loved\nto tear him limb from limb or burn him at the stake. In\nthe midst of all this forest fire of fury, one little boy wrote\nthe Kaiser a simple, sincere letter glowing with kindliness\nand admiration. This little boy said that no matter\nwhat the others thought, he would always love Wilhelm\nas his Emperor. The Kaiser was deeply touched by his\nletter and invited the little boy to come to see him. The\nboy came, so did his mother - and the Kaiser married\nher. That little boy didn\u2019t need to read a book on how to\nwin friends and influence people. He knew how instinctively.\nIf we want to make friends, let\u2019s put ourselves out to\ndo things for other people - things that require time, energy,\nunselfishness and thoughtfulness. When the Duke\nof Windsor was Prince of Wales, he was scheduled to\ntour South America, and before he started out on that\ntour he spent months studying Spanish so that he could\nmake public talks in the language of the country; and\nthe South Americans loved him for it.\nFor years I made it a point to find out the birthdays of\nmy friends. How? Although I haven\u2019t the foggiest bit of\nfaith in astrology, I began by asking the other party\nwhether he believed the date of one\u2019s birth has anything\nto do with character and disposition. I then asked him or\nher to tell me the month and day of birth. If he or she\nsaid November 24, for example, I kept repeating to myself,\n\u201cNovember 24, November 24.\u201d The minute my\nfriend\u2019s back was turned, I wrote down the name and\nbirthday and later would transfer it to a birthday book.\nAt the beginning of each year, I had these birthday dates\nscheduled in my calendar pad so that they came to my\nattention automatically. When the natal day arrived,\nthere was my letter or telegram. What a hit it made! I\nwas frequently the only person on earth who remembered.\nIf we want to make friends, let\u2019s greet people with\nanimation and enthusiasm. When somebody calls you on\nthe telephone use the same psychology. Say \u201cHello\u201d in\ntones that bespeak how pleased YOU are to have the person\ncall. Many companies train their telephone operatars\nto greet all callers in a tone of voice that radiates\ninterest and enthusiasm. The caller feels the company is\nconcerned about them. Let\u2019s remember that when we\nanswer the telephone tomorrow.\nShowing a genuine interest in others not only wins\nfriends for you, but may develop in its customers a loyalty\nto your company. In an issue of the publication of\nthe National Bank of North America of New York, the\nfollowing letter from Madeline Rosedale, a depositor,\nwas published: *')),(0,o.kt)("ul",null,(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},'Eagle, publication of the Natirmal Bank of North America, h-ew York,\nMarch 31, 1978.\n\u201cI would like you to know how much I appreciate\nyour staff. Everyone is so courteous, polite and helpful.\nWhat a pleasure it is, after waiting on a long line, to have\nthe teller greet you pleasantly.\n\u201cLast year my mother was hospitalized for five\nmonths. Frequently I went to Marie Petrucello, a teller.\nShe was concerned about my mother and inquired about\nher progress.\u201d\nIs there any doubt that Mrs. Rosedale will continue to\nuse this bank?\nCharles R. Walters, of one of the large banks in New\nYork City, was assigned to prepare a confidential report\non a certain corporation. He knew of only one person\nwho possessed the facts he needed so urgently. As Mr.\nWalters was ushered into the president\u2019s office, a young\nwoman stuck her head through a door and told the president\nthat she didn\u2019t have any stamps for him that day.\n"I am collecting stamps for my twelve-year-old son,\u201d\nthe president explained to Mr. Walters.\nMr. Walters stated his mission and began asking questions.\nThe president was vague, general, nebulous. He\ndidn\u2019t want to talk, and apparently nothing could persuade\nhim to talk. The interview was brief and barren.\n\u201cFrankly, I didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Mr. Walters said\nas he related the story to the class. \u201cThen I remembered\nwhat his secretary had said to him - stamps, twelve-year-\nold son. . . And I also recalled that the foreign department\nof our bank collected stamps - stamps taken\nfrom letters pouring in from every continent washed by\nthe seven seas.\n\u201cThe next afternoon I called on this man and sent in\nword that I had some stamps for his boy. Was I ushered\nin with enthusiasm? Yes sir, He couldn\u2019t have shaken\nmy hand with more enthusiasm if he had been running\nfor Congress. He radiated smiles and good will. \u2018My\nGeorge will love this one,\u2019 he kept saying as he fondled\nthe stamps. \u2018And look at this! This is a treasure.\u2019\n\u201cWe spent half an hour talking stamps and looking at\na picture of his boy, and he then devoted more than an\nhour of his time to giving me every bit of information I\nwanted - without my even suggesting that he do it. He\ntold me all he knew, and then called in his subordinates\nand questioned them. He telephoned some of his associates.\nHe loaded me down with facts, figures, reports\nand correspondence. In the parlance of newspaper reporters,\nI had a scoop.\u201d\nHere is another illustration:\nC. M. Knaphle, Jr., of Philadelphia had tried for years\nto sell fuel to a large chain-store organization. But the\nchain-store company continued to purchase its fuel from\nan out-of-town dealer and haul it right past the door of\nKnaphle\u2019s office. Mr, Knaphle made a speech one night\nbefore one of my classes, pouring out his hot wrath\nupon chain stores, branding them as a curse to the\nnation.\nAnd still he wondered why he couldn\u2019t sell them.\nI suggested that he try different tactics. To put it\nbriefly, this is what happened. We staged a debate between\nmembers of the course on whether the spread of\nthe chain store is doing the country more harm than\ngood.\nKnaphle, at my suggestion, took the negative side; he\nagreed to defend the chain stores, and then went straight\nto an executive of the chain-store organization that he\ndespised and said: \u201cI am not here to try to sell fuel. I\nhave come to ask you to do me a favor.\u201d He then told\nabout his debate and said, \u201cI have come to you for help\nbecause I can\u2019t think of anyone else who would be more\ncapable of giving me the facts I want. I\u2019m anxious to win\nthis debate, and I\u2019ll deeply appreciate whatever help\nyou can give me.\u201d\nHere is the rest of the story in Mr. Knaphle\u2019s own\nwords:\nI had asked this man for precisely one minute of his time.\nIt was with that understanding that he consented to see me.\nAfter I had stated my case, he motioned me to a chair and\ntalked to me for exactly one hour and forty-seven minutes.\nHe called in another executive who had written a book on\nchain stores. He wrote to the National Chain Store Association\nand secured for me a copy of a debate on the subject.\nHe feels that the chain store is rendering a real service to\nhumanity. He is proud of what he is doing for hundreds of\ncommunities. His eyes fairly glowed as he talked, and I\nmust confess that he opened my eyes to things I had never\neven dreamed of. He changed my whole mental attitude.\nAs I was leaving, he walked with me to the door, put his\narm around my shoulder, wished me well in my debate, and\nasked me to stop in and see him again and let him know\nhow I made out. The last words he said to me were: \u201cPlease\nsee me again later in the spring. I should like to place an\norder with you for fuel.\u201d\nTo me that was almost a miracle. Here he was offering to\nbuy fuel without my even suggesting it. I had made more\nheadway in two hours by becoming genuinely interested in\nhim and his problems than I could have made in ten years\ntrying to get him interested in me and my product.\nYou didn\u2019t discover a new truth, Mr. Knaphle, for a\nlong time ago, a hundred years before Christ was born\na famous old Roman poet, Publilius Syrus, remarked;\n\u201cWe are interested in others when they are interested in us."\nA show of interest, as with every other principle of\nhuman relations, must be sincere. It must pay off not\nonly for the person showing the interest, but for the person\nreceiving the attention. It is a two-way street-both\nparties benefit.\nMartin Ginsberg, who took our Course in Long Island\nNew York, reported how the special interest a nurse took\nin him profoundly affected his life:\n\u201cIt was Thanksgiving Day and I was ten years old. I\nwas in a welfare ward of a city hospital and was scheduled\nto undergo major orthopedic surgery the next day.\nI knew that I could only look forward to months of confinement,\nconvalescence and pain. My father was dead;\nmy mother and I lived alone in a small apartment and\nwe were on welfare. My mother was unable to visit me\nthat day.\n\u201cAs the day went on, I became overwhelmed with the\nfeeling of loneliness, despair and fear. I knew my\nmother was home alone worrying about me, not having\nanyone to be with, not having anyone to eat with and not\neven having enough money to afford a Thanksgiving\nDay dinner.\n\u201cThe tears welled up in my eyes, and I stuck my head\nunder the pillow and pulled the covers over it, I cried\nsilently, but oh so bitterly, so much that my body racked\nwith pain.\n\u201cA young student nurse heard my sobbing and came\nover to me. She took the covers off my face and started\nwiping my tears. She told me how lonely she was, having\nto work that day and not being able to be with her\nfamily. She asked me whether I would have dinner with\nher. She brought two trays of food: sliced turkey, mashed\na potatoes, cranberry sauce and ice cream for dessert. She\ntalked to me and tried to calm my fears. Even though\nshe was scheduled to go off duty at 4 P.M., she stayed on\nher own time until almost 11 P.M. She played games\nwith me, talked to me and stayed with me until I finally\nfell asleep.\n\u201cMany Thanksgivings have come and gone since I\nwas ten, but one never passes without me remembering\nthat particular one and my feelings of frustration, fear,\nloneliness and the warmth and tenderness of the\nstranger that somehow made it all bearable.\u201d\nIf you want others to like you, if you want to develop\nreal friendships, if you want to help others at the\nsame time as you help yourself, keep this principle in\nmind:\nPRINCIPLE 1Become genuinely interested in other people.A SIMPLE WAY TO MAKE A GOODFIRST IMPRESSION\nAt a dinner party in New York, one of the guests, a\nwoman who had inherited money, was eager to make\na pleasing impression on everyone. She had squandered\na modest fortune on sables, diamonds and pearls. But\nshe hadn\u2019t done anything whatever about her face. It\nradiated sourness and selfishness. She didn\u2019t realize\nwhat everyone knows: namely, that the expression one\nwears on one\u2019s face is far more important than the\nclothes one wears on one\u2019s back.\nCharles Schwab told me his smile had been worth a\nmillion dollars. And he was probably understating the\ntruth. For Schwab\u2019s personality, his charm, his ability to\nmake people like him, were almost wholly responsible\nfor his extraordinary success; and one of the most delightful\nfactors in his personality was his captivating\nsmile.\nActions speak louder than words, and a smile says, \u201cI\nlike you, You make me happy. I am glad to see you.\u201d\nThat is why dogs make such a hit. They are so glad to\nsee us that they almost jump out of their skins. So, naturally,\nwe are glad to see them.\nA baby\u2019s smile has the same effect.\nHave you ever been in a doctor\u2019s waiting room and\nlooked around at all the glum faces waiting impatiently\nto be seen? Dr, Stephen K. Sproul, a veterinarian in Raytown,\nMissouri, told of a typical spring day when his\nwaiting room was full of clients waiting to have their\npets inoculated. No one was talking to anyone else, and\nall were probably thinking of a dozen other things they\nwould rather be doing than \u201cwasting time\u201d sitting in that\noffice. He told one of our classes: \u201cThere were six or\nseven clients waiting when a young woman came in\nwith a nine-month-old baby and a kitten. As luck would\nhave it, she sat down next to a gentleman who was more\nthan a little distraught about the long wait for service.\nThe next thing he knew, the baby just looked up at him\nwith that great big smile that is so characteristic of babies.\nWhat did that gentleman do? Just what you and I\nwould do, of course; he-smiled back at the baby. Soon\nhe struck up a conversation with the woman about her\nbaby and his grandchildren, and soon the entire reception\nroom joined in, and the boredom and tension were\nconverted into a pleasant and enjoyable experience.\u201d\nAn insincere grin? No. That doesn\u2019t fool anybody. We\nknow it is mechanical and we resent it. I am talking\nabout a real smile, a heartwarming smile, a smile that\ncomes from within, the kind of smile that will bring a\ngood price in the marketplace.\nProfessor James V. McConnell, a psychologist at the\nUniversity of Michigan, expressed his feelings about a\nsmile. \u201cPeople who smile,\u201d he said, \u201ctend to manage\nteach and sell more effectively, and to raise happier\nchildren. There\u2019s far more information in a smile than a\nfrown. That\u2019s why encouragement is a much more effective\nteaching device than punishment.\u201d\nThe employment manager of a large New York department\nstore told me she would rather hire a sales clerk\nwho hadn\u2019t finished grade school, if he or she has a\npleasant smile, than to hire a doctor of philosophy with\na somber face.\nThe effect of a smile is powerful - even when it is\nunseen. Telephone companies throughout the United\nStates have a program called \u201cphone power\u201d which is\noffered to employees who use the telephone for selling\ntheir services or products. In this program they suggest\nthat you smile when talking on the phone. Your \u201csmile\u201d\ncomes through in your voice.\nRobert Cryer, manager of a computer department for a\nCincinnati, Ohio, company, told how he had successfully\nfound the right applicant for a hard-to-fill position:\n\u201cI was desperately trying to recruit a Ph.D. in computer\nscience for my department. I finally located a\nyoung man with ideal qualifications who was about to\nbe graduated from Purdue University. After several\nphone conversations I learned that he had several offers\nfrom other companies, many of them larger and better\nknown than mine. I was delighted when he accepted my\noffer. After he started on the job, I asked him why he\nhad chosen us over the others. He paused for a moment\nand then he said: \u2018I think it was because managers in the\nother companies spoke on the phone in a cold, business-like\nmanner, which made me feel like just another business\ntransaction, Your voice sounded as if you were glad\nto hear from me . . . that you really wanted me to be part\nof your organization. \u2019 You can be assured, I am still answering\nmy phone with a smile.\u201d\nThe chairman of the board of directors of one of the\nlargest rubber companies \u2018in the United States told me\nthat, according to his observations, people rarely succeed\nat anything unless they have fun doing it. This\nindustrial leader doesn\u2019t put much faith in the old adage\nthat hard work alone is the magic key that will unlock\nthe door to our desires, \u201cI have known people,\u201d he said,\n\u201cwho succeeded because they had a rip-roaring good\ntime conducting their business. Later, I saw those people\nchange as the fun became work. The business had\ngrown dull, They lost all joy in it, and they failed.\u201d\nYou must have a good time meeting people if you expect\nthem to have a good time meeting you.\nI have asked thousands of business people to smile at\nsomeone every hour of the day for a week and then come\nto class and talk about the results. How did it work?\nLet\u2019s see. . . Here is a letter from William B. Steinhardt,\na New York stockbroker. His case isn\u2019t isolated. In fact,\nit is typical of hundreds of cases.\n\u201c1 have been married for over eighteen years,\u201d wrote\nMr. Steinhardt, \u201cand in all that time I seldom smiled at\nmy wife or spoke two dozen words to her from the time\nI got up until I was ready to leave for business. I was\none of the worst grouches who ever walked down Broadway.\n\u201cWhen you asked me to make a talk about my experience\nwith smiles, I thought I would try it for a week. So\nthe next morning, while combing my hair, I looked at\nmy glum mug in the mirror and said to myself, \u2018Bill, you\nare going to wipe the scowl off that sour puss of yours\ntoday. You are going to smile. And you are going to begin\nright now.\u2019 As I sat down to breakfast, I greeted my wife\nwith a \u2018Good morning, my dear,\u2019 and smiled as I said\nit.\n\u201cYou warned me that she might be surprised. Well,\nyou underestimated her reaction. She was bewildered.\nShe was shocked. I told her that in the future she could\nexpect this as a regular occurrence, and I kept it up every\nmorning.\n\u201cThis changed attitude of mine brought more happiness\ninto our home in the two months since I started\nthan there was during the last year.\n\u201cAs I leave for my office, I greet the elevator operator\nin the apartment house with a \u2018Good morning\u2019 and a\nsmile, I greet the doorman with a smile. I smile at the\ncashier in the subway booth when I ask for change. As I\nstand on the floor of the Stock Exchange, I smile at people\nwho until recently never saw me smile.\n\u201cI soon found that everybody was smiling back at me,\nI treat those who come to me with complaints or grievances\nin a cheerful manner, I smile as I listen to them\nand I find that adjustments are accomplished much easier.\nI find that smiles are bringing me dollars, many dollars\nevery day.\n\u201cI share my office with another broker. One of his\nclerks is a likable young chap, and I was so elated about\nthe results I was getting that I told him recently about\nmy new philosophy of human relations. He then confessed\nthat when I first came to share my office with his\nfirm he thought me a terrible grouch - and only recently\nchanged his mind. He said I was really human when I\nsmiled.\n\u201cI have also eliminated criticism from my system. I\ngive appreciation and praise now instead of condemnation.\nI have stopped talking about what I want. I am now\ntrying to see the other person\u2019s viewpoint. And these\nthings have literally revolutionized my life. I am a totally\ndifferent man, a happier man, a richer man, richer in\nfriendships and happiness - the only things that matter\nmuch after all.\u201d\nYou don\u2019t feel like smiling? Then what? Two things.\nFirst, force yourself to smile. If you are alone, force yourself\nto whistle or hum a tune or sing. Act as if you were\nalready happy, and that will tend to make you happy.\nHere is the way the psychologist and philosopher William\nJames put it:\n\u201cAction seems to follow feeling, but really action and\nfeeling go together; and by regulating the action, which\nis under the more direct control of the will, we can indirectly\nregulate the feeling, which is not.\n\u201cThus the sovereign voluntary path to cheerfulness, if\nour cheerfulness be lost, is to sit up cheerfully and to act\nand speak as if cheerfulness were already there. . . .\u201d\nEvery body in the world is seeking happiness - and\nthere is one sure way to find it. That is by controlling\nyour thoughts. Happiness doesn\u2019t depend on outward\nconditions. It depends on inner conditions.\nIt isn\u2019t what you have or who you are or where you are\nor what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy.\nIt is what you think about it. For example, two people\nmay be in the same place, doing the same thing; both\nmay have about an equal amount of money and prestige')),(0,o.kt)("ul",null,(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},'and yet one may be miserable and the other happy.\nWhy? Because of a different mental attitude. I have seen\njust as many happy faces among the poor peasants toiling\nwith their primitive tools in the devastating heat of the\ntropics as I have seen in air-conditioned offices in New\nYork, Chicago or Los Angeles.\n\u201cThere is nothing either good or bad,\u201d said Shakespeare,\n\u201cbut thinking makes it so.\u201d\nAbe Lincoln once remarked that \u201cmost folks are about\nas happy as they make up their minds to be.\u201d He was\nright. I saw a vivid illustration of that truth as I was\nwalking up the stairs of the Long Island Railroad station\nin New York. Directly in front of me thirty or forty crippled\nboys on canes and crutches were struggling up the\nstairs. One boy had to be carried up. I was astonished at\ntheir laughter and gaiety. I spoke about it to one of.the\nmen in charge of the boys. \u201cOh, yes,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen a\nboy realizes that he is going to be a cripple for life, he is\nshocked at first; but after he gets over the shock, he usually\nresigns himself to his fate and then becomes as\nhappy as normal boys.\u201d\nI felt like taking my hat off to those boys. They taught\nme a lesson I hope I shall never forget.\nWorking all by oneself in a closed-off room in an office\nnot only is lonely, but it denies one the opportunity of\nmaking friends with other employees in the company.\nSe\xf1ora Maria Gonzalez of Guadalajara, Mexico, had\nsuch a job. She envied the shared comradeship of other\npeople in the company as she heard their chatter and\nlaughter. As she passed them in the hall during the first\nweeks of her employment, she shyly looked the other\nway.\nAfter a few weeks, she said to herself, \u201cMaria, you\ncan\u2019t expect those women to come to you. You have to\ngo out and meet them. \u201d The next time she walked to the\nwater cooler, she put on her brightest smile and said,\n\u201cHi, how are you today\u201d to each of the people she met.\nThe effect was immediate. Smiles and hellos were returned,\nthe hallway seemed brighter, the job friendlier.\nAcquaintanceships developed and some ripened into\nfriendships. Her job and her life became more pleasant\nand interesting.\nPeruse this bit of sage advice from the essayist and\npublisher Elbert Hubbard - but remember, perusing it\nwon\u2019t do you any good unless you apply it:\nWhenever you go out-of-doors, draw the chin in, carry the\ncrown of the head high, and fill the lungs to the utmost;\ndrink in the sunshine; greet your friends with a smile, and\nput soul into every handclasp. Do not fear being misunderstood\nand do not waste a minute thinking about your enemies.\nTry to fix firmly in your mind what you would like to\ndo; and then, without veering off direction, you will move\nstraight to the goal. Keep your mind on the great and splendid\nthings you would like to do, and then, as the days go\ngliding away, you will find yourself unconsciously seizing\nupon the opportunities that are required for the fulfillment\nof your desire, just as the coral insect takes from the running\ntide the element it needs. Picture in your mind the able,\nearnest, useful person you desire to be, and the thought you\nhold is hourly transforming you into that particular individual.\n. . . Thought is supreme. Preserve a right mental attitude -\nthe attitude of courage, frankness, and good cheer.\nTo think rightly is to create. All things come through desire\nand every sincere prayer is answered. We become like that\non which our hearts are fixed. Carry your chin in and the\ncrown of your head high. We are gods in the chrysalis.\nThe ancient Chinese were a wise lot - wise in the\nways of the world; and they had a proverb that you and\nI ought to cut out and paste inside our hats. It goes like\nthis: \u201cA man without a smiling face must not open a\nshop.\u201d\nYour smile is a messenger of your good will. Your\nsmile brightens the lives of all who see it. To someone\nwho has seen a dozen people frown, scowl or turn their\nfaces away, your smile is like the sun breaking through\nthe clouds. Especially when that someone is under pressure\nfrom his bosses, his customers, his teachers or parents\nor children, a smile can help him realize that all is\nnot hopeless - that there is joy in the world.\nSome years ago, a department store in New York City,\nin recognition of the pressures its sales clerks were\nunder during the Christmas rush, presented the readers\nof its advertisements with the following homely philosophy:\nTHE VALUE OF A SMILE AT CHRISTMAS\nIt costs nothing, but creates much.\nIt enriches those who receive, without impoverishing those\nwho give.\nIt happens in a flash and the memory of it sometimes lasts\nforever,\nNone are so rich they can get along without it, and none so\npoor but are richer for its benefits.\nIt creates happiness in the home, fosters good will in a\nbusiness, and is the countersign of friends.\nIt is rest to the weary, daylight to the discouraged, sunshine\nto the sad, and Nature\u2019s best antidote fee trouble.\nYet it cannot be bought, begged, borrowed, or stolen, for it\nis something that is no earthly good to anybody till it is\ngiven away.\nAnd if in the last-minute rush of Christmas buying some of\nour salespeople should be too tired to give you a smile,\nmay we ask you to leave one of yours?\nFor nobody needs a smile so much as those who have none\nleft to give!\nPRINCIPLE 2Smile.IF YOU DON\u2019T DO THIS, YOU AREHEADED FOR TROUBLE\nBack in 1898, a tragic thing happened in Rockland\nCounty, New York. A child had died, and on this particular\nday the neighbors were preparing to go to the funeral.\nJim Farley went out to the barn to hitch up his\nhorse. The ground was covered with snow, the air was\ncold and snappy; the horse hadn\u2019t been exercised for\ndays; and as he was led out to the watering trough, he\nwheeled playfully, kicked both his heels high in the air,\nand killed Jim Farley. So the little village of Stony Point\nhad two funerals that week instead of one.\nJim Farley left behind him a widow and three boys,\nand a few hundred dollars in insurance.\nHis oldest boy, Jim, was ten, and he went to work in a\nbrickyard, wheeling sand and pouring it into the molds\nand turning the brick on edge to be dried by the sun.\nThis boy Jim never had a chance to get much education.\nBut with his natural geniality, he had a flair for making\npeople like him, so he went into politics, and as the\nyears went by, he developed an uncanny ability for remembering\npeople\u2019s names.\nHe never saw the inside of a high school; but before\nhe was forty-six years of age, four colleges had honored\nhim with degrees and he had become chairman of the\nDemocratic National Committee and Postmaster General\nof the United States.\nI once interviewed Jim Farley and asked him the secret\nof his success. He said, \u201cHard work,\u201d and I said,\n\u201cDon\u2019t be funny.\u201d\nHe then asked me what I thought was the reason for\nhis success. I replied: "I understand you can call ten\nthousand people by their first names.\u201d\n\u201cNo. You are wrong, " he said. \u201cI can call fifty thousand\npeople by their first names.\u201d\nMake no mistake about it. That ability helped Mr. Farley\nput Franklin D. Roosevelt in the White House when\nhe managed Roosevelt\u2019s campaign in 1932.\nDuring the years that Jim Farley traveled as a salesman\nfor a gypsum concern, and during the years that he\nheld office as town clerk in Stony Point, he built up a\nsystem for remembering names.\nIn the beginning, it was a very simple one. Whenever\nhe met a new acquaintance, he found out his or her complete\nname and some facts about his or her family, business\nand political opinions. He fixed all these facts well\nin mind as part of the picture, and the next time he met\nthat person, even if it was a year later, he was able to\nshake hands, inquire after the family, and ask about the\nhollyhocks in the backyard. No wonder he developed a\nfollowing!\nFor months before Roosevelt\u2019s campaign for President\nbegan, Jim Farley wrote hundreds of letters a day to\npeople all over the western and northwestern states.\nThen he hopped onto a train and in nineteen days covered\ntwenty states and twelve thousand miles, traveling\nby buggy, train, automobile and boat. He would drop\ninto town, meet his people at lunch or breakfast, tea or\ndinner, and give them a \u201cheart-to-heart talk.\u201d Then he\u2019d\ndash off again on another leg of his journey.\nAs soon as he arrived back East, he wrote to one person\nin each town he had visited, asking for a list of all\nthe guests to whom he had talked. The final list contained\nthousands and thousands of names; yet each person\non that list was paid the subtle flattery of getting a\npersonal letter from James Farley. These letters began\n\u201cDear Bill\u201d or \u201cDear Jane,\u201d and they were always\nsigned "Jim."\nJim Farley discovered early in life that the average\nperson is more interested in his or her own name than\nin all the other names on earth put together. Remember\nthat name and call it easily, and you have paid a subtle\nand very effective compliment. But forget it or misspell\nit - and you have placed yourself at a sharp disadvantage.\nFor example, I once organized a public-speaking\ncourse in Paris and sent form letters to all the American\nresidents in the city. French typists with apparently little\nknowledge of English filled in the names and naturally\nthey made blunders. One man, the manager of a\nlarge American bank in Paris, wrote me a scathing rebuke\nbecause his name had been misspelled.\nSometimes it is difficult to remember a name, particularly\nif it is hard to pronounce. Rather than even try to\nlearn it, many people ignore it or call the person by an\neasy nickname. Sid Levy called on a customer for some\ntime whose name was Nicodemus Papadoulos. Most\npeople just called him \u201cNick.\u201d Levy told us: \u201cI made a\nspecial effort to say his name over several times to myself\nbefore I made my call. When I greeted him by his\nfull name: \'Good afternoon, Mr. Nicodemus Papadoulos,\u2019\nhe was shocked. For what seemed like several minutes\nthere was no reply from him at all. Finally, he said\nwith tears rolling down his cheeks, \u2018Mr. Levy, in all the\nfifteen years I have been in this country, nobody has\never made the effort to call me by my right name.\u2019 "\nWhat was the reason for Andrew Carnegie\u2019s success?\nHe was called the Steel King; yet he himself knew\nlittle about the manufacture of steel. He had hundreds\nof people working for him who knew far more about\nsteel than he did.\nBut he knew how to handle people, and that is what\nmade him rich. Early in life, he showed a flair for organization,\na genius for leadership. By the time he was ten,\nhe too had discovered the astounding importance people\nplace on their own name. And he used that discovery to\nwin cooperation. To illustrate: When he was a boy back\nin Scotland, he got hold of a rabbit, a mother rabbit.\nPresto! He soon had a whole nest of little rabbits - and\nnothing to feed them. But he had a brilliant idea. He told\nthe boys and girls in the neighborhood that if they would\ngo out and pull enough clover and dandelions to feed\nthe rabbits, he would name the bunnies in their honor.\nThe plan worked like magic, and Carnegie never forgot\nit.\nYears later, he made millions by using the same psychology\nin business. For example, he wanted to sell\nsteel rails to the Pennsylvania Railroad. J. Edgar Thomson\nwas the president of the Pennsylvania Railroad then.\nSo Andrew Carnegie built a huge steel mill in Pittsburgh\nand called it the \u201cEdgar Thomson Steel Works.\u201d\nHere is a riddle. See if you can guess it. When the\nPennsylvania Railroad needed steel rails, where do you\nsuppose J. Edgar Thomson bought them?. . , From\nSears, Roebuck? No. No. You\u2019re wrong. Guess again.\nWhen Carnegie and George Pullman were battling\neach other for supremacy in the railroad sleeping-car\nbusiness, the Steel King again remembered the lesson\nof the rabbits.\nThe Central Transportation Company, which Andrew\nCarnegie controlled, was fighting with the company that\nPullman owned. Both were struggling to get the sleeping-\ncar business of the Union Pacific Railroad, bucking\neach other, slashing prices, and destroving all chance of\nprofit. Both Carnegie and Pullman had gone to New\nYork to see the board of directors of the Union Pacific.\nMeeting one evening in the St. Nicholas Hotel, Carnegie\nsaid: \u201cGood evening, Mr. Pullman, aren\u2019t we making\na couple of fools of ourselves?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean.?" Pullman demanded.\nThen Carnegie expressed what he had on his mind - a\nmerger of their two interests. He pictured in glowing\nterms the mutual advantages of working with, instead of\nagainst, each other. Pullman listened attentively, but he\nwas not wholly convinced. Finally he asked, \u201cWhat\nwould you call the new company?\u201d and Carnegie replied\npromptly: \u201cWhy, the Pullman Palace Car Company,\nof course.\u201d\nPullman\u2019s face brightened. \u201cCome into my room,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cLet\u2019s talk it over.\u201d That talk made industrial history.\nThis policy of remembering and honoring the names\nof his friends and business associates was one of the\nsecrets of Andrew Carnegie\u2019s leadership. He was proud\nof the fact that he could call many of his factory workers\nby their first names, and he boasted that while he was\npersonally in charge, no strike ever disturbed his flaming\nsteel mills.\nBenton Love, chairman of Texas Commerce Banc-\nshares, believes that the bigger a corporation gets, the\ncolder it becomes. " One way to warm it up,\u201d he said, \u201cis\nto remember people\u2019s names. The executive who tells\nme he can\u2019t remember names is at the same time telling\nme he can\u2019t remember a significant part of his business\nand is operating on quicksand.\u201d\nKaren Kirsech of Rancho Palos Verdes, California, a\nflight attendant for TWA, made it a practice to learn the\nnames of as many passengers in her cabin as possible\nand use the name when serving them. This resulted in\nmany compliments on her service expressed both to her\ndirectly and to the airline. One passenger wrote: "I\nhaven\u2019t flown TWA for some time, but I\u2019m going to start\nflying nothing but TWA from now on. You make me feel\nthat your airline has become a very personalized airline\nand that is important to me.\u201d\nPeople are so proud of their names that they strive to\nperpetuate them at any cost. Even blustering, hard-boiled\nold P. T. Barnum, the greatest showman of his\ntime, disappointed because he had no sons to carry on\nhis name, offered his grandson, C. H. Seeley, $25,000\ndollars if he would call himself \u201cBarnum\u201d Seeley.\nFor many centuries, nobles and magnates supported\nartists, musicians and authors so that their creative works\nwould be dedicated to them.\nLibraries and museums owe their richest collections\nto people who cannot bear to think that their names\nmight perish from the memory of the race. The New\nYork Public Library has its Astor and Lenox collections.\nThe Metropolitan Museum perpetuates the names of\nBenjamin Altman and J. P. Morgan. And nearly every\nchurch is beautified by stained-glass windows commemorating\nthe names of their donors. Many of the buildings\non the campus of most universities bear the names of\ndonors who contributed large sums of money for this\nhonor.\nMost people don\u2019t remember names, for the simple\nreason that they don\u2019t take the time and energy necessary\nto concentrate and repeat and fix names indelibly in\ntheir minds. They make excuses for themselves; they are\ntoo busy.\nBut they were probably no busier than Franklin D.\nRoosevelt, and he took time to remember and recall\neven the names of mechanics with whom he came into\ncontact.\nTo illustrate: The Chrysler organization built a special\ncar for Mr. Roosevelt, who could not use a standard car\nbecause his legs were paralyzed. W. F. Chamberlain and\na mechanic delivered it to the White House. I have in\nfront of me a letter from Mr. Chamberlain relating his\nexperiences. "I taught President Roosevelt how to handle\na car with a lot of unusual gadgets, but he taught me\na lot about the fine art of handling people.\n"When I called at the White House,\u201d Mr. Chamberlain\nwrites, \u201cthe President was extremely pleasant and\ncheerful. He called me by name, made me feel very\ncomfortable, and particularly impressed me with the fact\nthat he was vitally interested in things I had to show him\nand tell him. The car was so designed that it could be\noperated entirely by hand. A crowd gathered around to\nlook at the car; and he remarked: \u2018I think it is marvelous.\nAll you have to do is to touch a button and it moves away\nand you can drive it without effort. I think it is grand - I\ndon\u2019t know what makes it go. I\u2019d love to have the time to\ntear it down and see how it works.\u2019\n\u201cWhen Roosevelt\u2019s friends and associates admired the\nmachine, he said in their presence: \u2018Mr. Chamberlain, I\ncertainly appreciate all the time and effort you have\nspent in developing this car. It is a mighty fine job.\u2019 He\nadmired the radiator, the special rear-vision mirror and\nclock, the special spotlight, the kind of upholstery, the\nsitting position of the driver\u2019s seat, the special suitcases\nin the trunk with his monogram on each suitcase. In\nother words, he took notice of every detail to which he\nknew I had given considerable thought. He made a point\nof bringing these various pieces of equipment to the attention\nof Mrs. Roosevelt, Miss Perkins, the Secretary of\nLabor, and his secretary. He even brought the old White\nHouse porter into the picture by saying, \u2018George, you\nwant to take particularly good care of the suitcases.\u2019\n\u201cWhen the driving lesson was finished, the President\nturned to me and said: \u2018Well, Mr. Chamberlain, I have\nbeen keeping the Federal Reserve Board waiting thirty\nminutes. I guess I had better get back to work.\u2019\n"I took a mechanic with me to the White House. He\nwas introduced to Roosevelt when he arrived. He didn\u2019t\ntalk to the President, and Roosevelt heard his name only\nonce. He was a shy chap, and he kept in the background.\nBut before leaving us, the President looked for the mechanic,\nshook his hand, called him by name, and\nthanked him for coming to Washington. And there was\nnothing perfunctory about his thanks. He meant what he\nsaid. I could feel that.\n\u201cA few days after returning to New York, I got an autographed\nphotograph of President Roosevelt and a little\nnote of thanks again expressing his appreciation for my\nassistance. How he found time to do it is a mystery to\nme ."\nFranklin D. Roosevelt knew that one of the simplest,\nmost obvious and most important ways of gaining good\nwill was by remembering names and making people feel\nimportant - yet how many of us do it?\nHalf the time we are introduced to a stranger, we chat\na few minutes and can\u2019t even remember his or her name\nby the time we say goodbye.\nOne of the first lessons a politician learns is this: \u201cTo\nrecall a voter\u2019s name is statesmanship. To forget it is\noblivion.\u201d\nAnd the ability to remember names is almost as important\nin business and social contacts as it is in politics.\nNapoleon the Third, Emperor of France and nephew\nof the great Napoleon, boasted that in spite of all his\nroyal duties he could remember the name of every person\nhe met.\nHis technique? Simple. If he didn\u2019t hear the name\ndistinctly, he said, \u201cSo sorry. I didn\u2019t get the name\nclearly.\u201d Then, if it was an unusual name, he would say,\n\u201cHow is it spelled?\u201d\nDuring the conversation, he took the trouble to repeat\nthe name several times, and tried to associate it in his\nmind with the person\u2019s features, expression and general\nappearance.\nIf the person was someone of importance, Napoleon\nwent to even further pains. As soon as His Royal Highness\nwas alone, he wrote the name down on a piece of\npaper, looked at it, concentrated on it, fixed it securely\nin his mind, and then tore up the paper. In this way, he\ngained an eye impression of the name as well as an ear\nimpression.\nAll this takes time, but \u201cGood manners,\u201d said Emerson,\n"are made up of petty sacrifices.\u201d\nThe importance of remembering and using names is\nnot just the prerogative of kings and corporate executives.\nIt works for all of us. Ken Nottingham, an employee\nof General Motors in Indiana, usually had lunch\nat the company cafeteria. He noticed that the woman\nwho worked behind the counter always had a scowl on\nher face. \u201cShe had been making sandwiches for about\ntwo hours and I was just another sandwich to her. I told\nher what I wanted. She weighed out the ham on a little\nscale, then she gave me one leaf of lettuce, a few potato\nchips and handed them to me.\n\u201cThe next day I went through the same line. Same\nwoman, same scowl. The only difference was I noticed\nher name tag. I smiled and said, \u2018Hello, Eunice,\u2019 and\nthen told her what I wanted. Well, she forgot the scale,\npiled on the ham, gave me three leaves of lettuce and\nheaped on the potato chips until they fell off the plate.\u201d\nWe should be aware of the magic contained in a name\nand realize that this single item is wholly and completely\nowned by the person with whom we are dealing\nand nobody else. The name sets the individual apart;\nit makes him or her unique among all others. The information\nwe are imparting or the request we are making\ntakes on a special importance when we approach the\nsituation with the name of the individual. From the waitress\nto the senior executive, the name will work magic\nas we deal with others.\nPRINCIPLE 3Remember that a person\u2019s name is to thatperson the sweetest and most importantsound in any language.AN EASY WAY TO BECOME AGOOD CONVERSATIONALISTSome time ago, I attended a bridge party. I don\u2019t play\nbridge - and there was a woman there who didn\u2019t play\nbridge either. She had discovered that I had once been\nLowell Thomas\u2019 manager before he went on the radio\nand that I had traveled in Europe a great deal while\nhelping him prepare the illustrated travel talks he was\nthen delivering. So she said: \u201cOh, Mr. Carnegie, I do\nwant you to tell me about all the wonderful places you\nhave visited and the sights you have seen.\u201d\nAs we sat down on the sofa, she remarked that she and\nher husband had recently returned from a trip to Africa.\n\u201cAfrica!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cHow interesting! I\u2019ve always\nwanted to see Africa, but I never got there except for a\ntwenty-four-hour stay once in Algiers. Tell me, did you\nvisit the big-game country? Yes? How fortunate. I envy\nyou. Do tell me about Africa.\u201d\nThat kept her talking for forty-five minutes. She never\nagain asked me where I had been or what I had seen.\nShe didn\u2019t want to hear me talk about my travels. All she\nwanted was an interested listener, so she could expand\nher ego and tell about where she had been.\nWas she unusual? No. Many people are like that.\nFor example, I met a distinguished botanist at a dinner\nparty given by a New York book publisher. I had never\ntalked with a botanist before, and I found him fascinating.\nI literally sat on the edge of my chair and listened\nwhile he spoke of exotic plants and experiments in\ndeveloping new forms of plant life and indoor gardens (and\neven told me astonishing facts about the humble potato).\nI had a small indoor garden of my own - and he was\ngood enough to tell me how to solve some of my problems.\nAs I said, we were at a dinner party. There must have\nbeen a dozen other guests, but I violated all the canons\nof courtesy, ignored everyone else, and talked for hours\nto the botanist.\nMidnight came, I said good night to everyone and\ndeparted. The botanist then turned to our host and\npaid me several flattering compliments. I was \u201cmost\nstimulating.\u201d I was this and I was that, and he ended by\nsaying I was a \u201cmost interesting conversationalist.\u201d\nAn interesting conversationalist? Why, I had said\nhardly anything at all. I couldn\u2019t have said anything if I\nhad wanted to without changing the subject, for I didn\u2019t\nknow any more about botany than I knew about the anatomy\nof a penguin. But I had done this: I had listened\nintently. I had listened because I was genuinely interested.\nAnd he felt it. Naturally that pleased him. That\nkind of listening is one of the highest compliments we\ncan pay anyone. \u201cFew human beings,\u201d wrote Jack\nWoodford in Strangers in Love, \u201cfew human beings are\nproof against the implied flattery of rapt attention.\u201d I\nwent even further than giving him rapt attention. I was\n\u201chearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise.\u201d\nI told him that I had been immensely entertained and\ninstructed - and I had. I told him I wished I had his\nknoledge - and I did. I told him that I should love to\nwander the fields with him - and I have. I told him I\nmust see him again - and I did.\nAnd so I had him thinking of me as a good conversationalist\nwhen, in reality, I had been merely a good listener\nand had encouraged him to talk.\nWhat is the secret, the mystery, of a successful business\ninterview? Well, according to former Harvard president\nCharles W. Eliot, \u201cThere is no mystery about\nsuccessful business intercourse. . . . Exclusive attention\nto the person who is speaking to you is very important.\nNothing else is so flattering as that.\u201d\nEliot himself was a past master of the art of listening,\nHenry James, one of America\u2019s first great novelists, recalled:\n\u201cDr. Eliot\u2019s listening was not mere silence, but a\nform of activity. Sitting very erect on the end of his spine\nwith hands joined in his lap, making no movement except\nthat he revolved his thumbs around each other\nfaster or slower, he faced his interlocutor and seemed to\nbe hearing with his eyes as well as his ears. He listened\nwith his mind and attentively considered what you had\nto say while you said it. . . . At the end of an interview\nthe person who had talked to him felt that he had had\nhis say.\u201d\nSelf-evident, isn\u2019t it? You don\u2019t have to study for four\nyears in Harvard to discover that. Yet I know and you\nknow department store owners who will rent expensive\nspace, buy their goods economically, dress their windows\nappealingly, spend thousands of dollars in advertising\nand then hire clerks who haven\u2019t the sense to be\ngood listeners - clerks who interrupt customers, contradict\nthem, irritate them, and all but drive them from the\nstore.\nA department store in Chicago almost lost a regular\ncustomer who spent several thousand dollars each year\nin that store because a sales clerk wouldn\u2019t listen. Mrs.\nHenrietta Douglas, who took our course in Chicago, had\npurchased a coat at a special sale. After she had brought\nit home she noticed that there was a tear in the lining.\nShe came back the next day and asked the sales clerk to\nexchange it. The clerk refused even to listen to her complaint.\n\u201cYou bought this at a special sale,\u201d she said. She\npointed to a sign on the wall. \u201cRead that,\u201d she exclaimed.\n" \'All sales are final.\'Once you bought it, you\nhave to keep it. Sew up the lining yourself.\u201d\n\u201cBut this was damaged merchandise,\u201d Mrs. Douglas\ncomplained.\n\u201cMakes no difference,\u201d the clerk interrupted. \u201cFinal\u2019s\nfinal "\nMrs. Douglas was about to walk out indignantly,\nswearing never to return to that store ever, when she\nwas greeted by the department manager, who knew her\nfrom her many years of patronage. Mrs. Douglas told her\nwhat had happened.\nThe manager listened attentively to the whole story,\nexamined the coat and then said: \u201cSpecial sales are\n\u2018final\u2019 so we can dispose of merchandise at the end of\nthe season. But this \'no return\u2019 policy does not apply to\ndamaged goods. We will certainly repair or replace the\nlining, or if you prefer, give you your money back.\u201d\nWhat a difference in treatment! If that manager had\nnot come along and listened to the Customer, a long-term\npatron of that store could have been lost forever.\nListening is just as important in one\'s home life as in\nthe world of business. Millie Esposito of Croton-on-Hudson,\nNew York, made it her business to listen carefully\nwhen one of her children wanted to speak with her.\nOne evening she was sitting in the kitchen with her son,\nRobert, and after a brief discussion of something that\nwas on his mind, Robert said: "Mom, I know that you\nlove me very much.\u201d\nMrs. Esposito was touched and said: \u201cOf course I love\nyou very much. Did you doubt it?\u201d\nRobert responded: "No, but I really know you love me\nbecause whenever I want to talk to you about something\nyou stop whatever you are doing and listen to me.\u201d\nThe chronic kicker, even the most violent critic, will\nfrequently soften and be subdued in the presence of a\npatient, sympathetic listener - a listener who will he silent\nwhile the irate fault-finder dilates like a king cobra\nand spews the poison out of his system. To illustrate:\nThe New York Telephone Company discovered a few\nyears ago that it had to deal with one of the most vicious\ncustomers who ever cursed a customer service representative.\nAnd he did curse. He raved. He threatened to tear\nthe phone out by its roots. He refused to pay certain\ncharges that he declared were false. He wrote letters to\nthe newspapers. He filed innumerable complaints with\nthe Public Service Commission, and he started several\nsuits against the telephone company.\nAt last, one of the company\u2019s most skillful \u201ctrouble-shooters\u201d\nwas sent to interview this stormy petrel. This\n\u201ctroubleshooter\u201d listened and let the cantankerous customer\nenjoy himself pouring out his tirade. The telephone\nrepresentative listened and said \u201cyes\u201d and\nsympathized with his grievance.\n\u201cHe raved on and I listened for nearlv three hours,\u201d\nthe \u201ctroubleshooter\u201d said as he related his experiences\nbefore one of the author\u2019s classes. \u201cThen I went back\nand listened some more. I interviewed him four times,\nand before the fourth visit was over I had become a\ncharter member of an organization he was starting. He\ncalled it the \u2018Telephone Subscribers\u2019 Protective Association.\'\nI am still a member of this organization, and, so\nfar as I know, I\u2019m the only member in the world today\nbesides Mr. ----.\n"I listened and sympathized with him on every point\nthat he made during these interviews. He had never had\na telephone representative talk with him that way before,\nand he became almost friendly. The point on which\nI went to see him was not even mentioned on the first\nvisit, nor was it mentioned on the second or third, but\nupon the fourth interview, I closed the case completely,\nhe paid all his bills in full, and for the first time in the\nhistory of his difficulties with the telephone company he\nvoluntarily withdrew his complaints from the Public\nService Commission.\u201d\nDoubtless Mr. ----- had considered himself a holy\ncrusader, defending the public rights against callous exploitation.\nBut in reality, what he had really wanted was\na feeling of importance. He got this feeling of importance\nat first by kicking and complaining. But as soon as\nhe got his feeling of importance from a representative of\nthe company, his imagined grievances vanished into\nthin air.\nOne morning years ago, an angry customer stormed\ninto the office of Julian F. Detmer, founder of the Detmer\nWoolen Company, which later became the world\u2019s\nlargest distributor of woolens to the tailoring trade.\n\u201cThis man owed us a small sum of money,\u201d Mr. Detmer\nexplained to me. \u201cThe customer denied it, but we\nknew he was wrong. So our credit department had insisted\nthat he pay. After getting a number of letters from\nour credit department, he packed his grip, made a trip to\nChicago, and hurried into my office to inform me not\nonly that he was not going to pay that bill, but that he\nwas never going to buy another dollar\u2019s worth of goods\nfrom the Detmer Woolen Company.\n"I listened patiently to all he had to say. I was tempted\nto interrupt, but I realized that would be bad policy, So\nI let him talk himself out. When he finally simmered\ndown and got in a receptive mood, I said quietly: \u2018I want\nto thank vou for coming to Chicago to tell me about this.\nYou have done me a great favor, for if our credit department\nhas annoyed you, it may annoy other good customers,\nand that would be just too bad. Believe me, I am far\nmore eager to hear this than you are to tell it.\u2019\n\u201cThat was the last thing in the world he expected me\nto say. I think he was a trifle disappointed, because he\nhad come to Chicago to tell me a thing or two, but here\nI was thanking him instead of scrapping with him. I assured\nhim we would wipe the charge off the books and\nforget it, because he was a very careful man with only\none account to look after, while our clerks had to look\nafter thousands. Therefore, he was less likely to be\nwrong than we were.\n\u201cI told him that I understood exactly how he felt and\nthat, if I were in his shoes, I should undoubtedly feel\nprecisely as he did. Since he wasn\u2019t going to buy from\nus anymore, I recommended some other woolen houses.\n\u201cIn the past, we had usually lunched together when\nhe came to Chicago, so I invited him to have lunch with\nme this day. He accepted reluctantly, but when we came\nback to the office he placed a larger order than ever\nbefore. He returned home in a softened mood and, wanting\nto be just as fair with us as we had been with him,\nlooked over his bills, found one that had been mislaid,\nand sent us a check with his apologies.\n"Later, when his wife presented him with a baby boy,\nhe gave his son the middle name of Detmer, and he\nremained a friend and customer of the house until his\ndeath twenty-two years afterwards.\u201d\nYears ago, a poor Dutch immigrant boy washed the\nwindows of a bakery shop after school to help support\nhis family. His people were so poor that in addition he\nused to go out in the street with a basket every day and\ncollect stray bits of coal that had fallen in the gutter\nwhere the coal wagons had delivered fuel. That boy,\nEdward Bok, never got more than six years of schooling\nin his life; yet eventually he made himself one of the\nmost successful magazine editors in the history of American\njournalism. How did he do it? That is a long story,\nbut how he got his start can be told briefly. He got his\nstart by using the principles advocated in this chapter.\nHe left school when he was thirteen and became an\noffice boy for Western Union, but he didn\u2019t for one moment\ngive up the idea of an education. Instead, he\nstarted to educate himself, He saved his carfares and\nwent without lunch until he had enough money to buy\nan encyclopedia of American biography - and then he\ndid an unheard-of thing. He read the lives of famous\npeople and wrote them asking for additional information\nabout their childhoods. He was a good listener. He\nasked famous people to tell him more about themselves.\nHe wrote General James A. Garfield, who was then running\nfor President, and asked if it was true that he was\nonce a tow boy on a canal; and Garfield replied. He\nwrote General Grant asking about a certain battle, and\nGrant drew a map for him and invited this fourteen-year\nold boy to dinner and spent the evening talking to him.\nSoon our Western Union messenger boy was corresponding\nwith many of the most famous people in the\nnation: Ralph Waldo Emerson, Oliver Wendell Holmes,\nLongfellow, Mrs. Abraham Lincoln, Louisa May Alcott,\nGeneral Sherman and Jefferson Davis. Not only did he\ncorrespond with these distinguished people, but as soon\nas he got a vacation, he visited many of them as a welcome\nguest in their homes. This experience imbued him\nwith a confidence that was invaluable. These men and\nwomen fired him with a vision and ambition that shaped\nhis life. And all this, let me repeat, was made possible\nsolely by the application of the principles we are discussing\nhere.\nIsaac F. Marcosson, a journalist who interviewed\nhundreds of celebrities, declared that many people fail\nto make a favorable impression because they don\u2019t listen\nattentively. \u201cThey have been so much concerned with\nwhat they are going to say next that they do not keep\ntheir ears open. . . . Very important people have told me\nthat they prefer good listeners to good talkers, but the\nability to listen seems rarer than almost any other good\ntrait ."\nAnd not only important personages crave a good listener,\nbut ordinary folk do too. As the Reader\u2019s Digest\nonce said: \u201cMany persons call a doctor when all they\nwant is an audience,\u201d\nDuring the darkest hours of the Civil War, Lincoln\nwrote to an old friend in Springfield, Illinois, asking him\nto come to Washington. Lincoln said he had some problems\nhe wanted to discuss with him. The old neighbor\ncalled at the White House, and Lincoln talked to him for\nhours about the advisability of issuing a proclamation\nfreeing the slaves. Lincoln went over all the arguments\nfor and against such a move, and then read letters and\nnewspaper articles, some denouncing him for not\nfreeing the slaves and others denouncing him for fear he\nwas going to free them. After talking for hours, Lincoln\nshook hands with his old neighbor, said good night, and\nsent him back to Illinois without even asking for his\nopinion. Lincoln had done all the talking himself. That\nseemed to clarify his mind. \u201cHe seemed to feel easier\nafter that talk,\u201d the old friend said. Lincoln hadn\u2019t\nwanted advice, He had wanted merely a friendly, sympathetic\nlistener to whom he could unburden himself.\nThat\u2019s what we all want when we are in trouble. That is\nfrequently all the irritated customer wants, and the dissatisfied\nemployee or the hurt friend.\nOne of the great listeners of modern times was Sigmund\nFreud. A man who met Freud described his manner\nof listening: \u201cIt struck me so forcibly that I shall\nnever forget him. He had qualities which I had never\nseen in any other man. Never had I seen such concentrated\nattention. There was none of that piercing \u2018soul\npenetrating gaze\u2019 business. His eyes were mild and genial.\nHis voice was low and kind. His gestures were few.\nBut the attention he gave me, his appreciation of what I\nsaid, even when I said it badly, was extraordinary,\nYou\'ve no idea what it meant to be listened to like that.\u201d\nIf you want to know how to make people shun you and\nlaugh at you behind your back and even despise you,\nhere is the recipe: Never listen to anyone for long. Talk\nincessantly about yourself. If you have an idea while the\nother person is talking, don\u2019t wait for him or her to finish:\nbust right in and interrupt in the middle of a sentence.\nDo you know people like that? I do, unfortunately;\nand the astonishing part of it is that some of them are\nprominent.\nBores, that is all they are - bores intoxicated with their\nown egos, drunk with a sense of their own importance.\nPeople who talk only of themselves think only of\nthemselves. And \u201cthose people who think only of themselves,\u201d\nDr. Nicholas Murray Butler, longtime president\nof Columbia University, said, "are hopelessly uneducated.\nThey are not educated,\u201d said Dr. Butler, \u201cno matter\nhow instructed they may be.\u201d\nSo if you aspire to be a good conversationalist, be an\nattentive listener. To be interesting, be interested. Ask\nquestions that other persons will enjoy answering. Encourage\nthem to talk about themselves and their accomplishments.\nRemember that the people you are talking to are a\nhundred times more interested in themselves and their\nwants and problems than they are in you and your problems.\nA person\u2019s toothache means more to that person\nthan a famine in China which kills a million people. A\nboil on one\u2019s neck interests one more than forty earthquakes\nin Africa. Think of that the next time you start a\nconversation.\nPRINCIPLE 4Be a good listener. Encourage others to talkabout themselves.\nHOW TO INTEREST PEOPLEEveryone who was ever a guest of Theodore Roosevelt\nwas astonished at the range and diversity of his knowledge.\nWhether his visitor was a cowboy or a Rough\nRider, a New York politician or a diplomat, Roosevelt\nknew what to say. And how was it done? The answer\nwas simple. Whenever Roosevelt expected a visitor, he\nsat up late the night before, reading up on the subject in\nwhich he knew his guest was particularly interested.\nFor Roosevelt knew, as all leaders know, that the royal\nroad to a person\u2019s heart is to talk about the things he or\nshe treasures most.\nThe genial William Lyon Phelps, essayist and professor\nof literature at Yale, learned this lesson early in life.\n"When I was eight years old and was spending a\nweekend visiting my Aunt Libby Linsley at her home in\nStratford on the Housatonic,\u201d he wrote in his essay on\nHuman Nature, \u201ca middle-aged man called one evening,\nand after a polite skirmish with my aunt, he devoted his\nattention to me. At that time, I happened to be excited\nabout boats, and the visitor discussed the subject in a\nway that seemed to me particularly interesting. After he\nleft, I spoke of him with enthusiasm. What a man! My\naunt informed me he was a New York lawyer, that he\ncared nothing whatever about boats - that he took not\nthe slightest interest in the subject. \u2018But why then did\nhe talk all the time about boats?\u2019\n" \u2018Because he is a gentleman. He saw you were interested\nin boats, and he talked about the things he knew\nwould interest and please you. He made himself agreeable.\u2019 "\nAnd William Lyon Phelps added: "I never forgot my\naunt\u2019s remark.\u201d\nAs I write this chapter, I have before me a letter from\nEdward L. Chalif, who was active in Boy Scout work.\n\u201cOne day I found I needed a favor,\u201d wrote Mr. Chalif.\n\u201cA big Scout jamboree was coming off in Europe, and I\nwanted the president of one of the largest corporations\nin America to pay the expenses of one of my boys for the\ntrip.\n\u201cFortunately, just before I went to see this man, I\nheard that he had drawn a check for a million dollars,\nand that after it was canceled, he had had it framed.\n\u201cSo the first thing I did when I entered his office was\nto ask to see the check. A check for a million dollars! I\ntold him I never knew that anybody had ever written\nsuch a check, and that I wanted to tell my boys that I had\nactually seen a check for a million dollars. He gladly\nshowed it to me; I admired it and asked him to tell me\nall about how it happened to be drawn.\u201d\nYou notice, don\u2019t you, that Mr. Chalif didn\u2019t begin by\ntalking about the Boy Scouts, or the jamboree in Europe,\nor what it was he wanted? He talked in terms of what\ninterested the other man. Here\u2019s the result:\n\u201cPresently, the man I was interviewing said: \u2018Oh, by\nthe way, what was it you wanted to see me about?\u2019 So I\ntold him.\n\u201cTo my vast surprise,\u201d Mr. Chalif continues, \u201che not\nonly granted immediately what I asked for, but much\nmore. I had asked him to send only one boy to Europe,\nbut he sent five boys and myself, gave me a letter of\ncredit for a thousand dollars and told us to stay in Europe\nfor seven weeks. He also gave me letters of introduction\nto his branch presidents, putting them at our service,\nand he himself met us in Paris and showed us the town.\nSince then, he has given jobs to some of the boys whose\nparents were in want, and he is still active in our group.\n\u201cYet I know if I hadn\u2019t found out what he was interested\nin, and got him warmed up first, I wouldn\u2019t have\nfound him one-tenth as easy to approach.\u201d\nIs this a valuable technique to use in business? Is it?\nLet\u2019s see, Take Henry G. Duvernoy of Duvemoy and\nSons, a wholesale baking firm in New York.\nMr. Duvernoy had been trying to sell bread to a certain\nNew York hotel. He had called on the manager\nevery week for four years. He went to the same social\naffairs the manager attended. He even took rooms in the\nhotel and lived there in order to get the business. But he\nfailed.\n\u201cThen,\u201d said Mr. Duvernoy, \u201cafter studying human\nrelations, I resolved to change my tactics. I decided to\nfind out what interested this man - what caught his enthusiasm.\n\u201cI discovered he belonged to a society of hotel executives\ncalled the Hotel Greeters of America. He not only\nbelonged, but his bubbling enthusiasm had made him\npresident of the organization, and president of the International\nGreeters. No matter where its conventions were\nheld, he would be there.\n\u201cSo when I saw him the next day, I began talking\nabout the Greeters. What a response I got. What a response!\nHe talked to me for half an hour about the\nGreeters, his tones vibrant with enthusiasm. I could\nplainly see that this society was not only his hobby, it\nwas the passion of his life. Before I left his office, he had\n\u2018sold\u2019 me a membership in his organization.\n\u201cIn the meantime, I had said nothing about bread. But\na few days later, the steward of his hotel phoned me to\ncome over with samples and prices.\n" \u2018I don\u2019t know what you did to the old boy,\u2019 the steward\ngreeted me, \u2018but he sure is sold on you!\u2019\n\u201cThink of it! I had been drumming at that man for four\nyears - trying to get his business - and I\u2019d still be drumming\nat him if I hadn\u2019t finally taken the trouble to find\nout what he was interested in, and what he enjoyed talking\nabout.\u201d\nEdward E. Harriman of Hagerstown, Maryland, chose\nto live in the beautiful Cumberland Valley of Maryland\nafter he completed his military service. Unfortunately,\nat that time there were few jobs available in the area. A\nlittle research uncovered the fact that a number of companies\nin the area were either owned or controlled by an\nunusual business maverick, R. J. Funkhouser, whose\nrise from poverty to riches intrigued Mr. Harriman.\nHowever, he was known for being inaccessible to job\nseekers. Mr. Harriman wrote:\n"I interviewed a number of people and found that his\nmajor interest was anchored in his drive for power and\nmoney. Since he protected himself from people like me\nby use of a dedicated and stern secretary, I studied her\ninterests and goals and only then I paid an unannounced\nvisit at her office. She had been Mr. Funkhouser\u2019s orbiting\nsatellite for about fifteen years. When I told her I\nhad a proposition for him which might translate itself\ninto financial and political success for him, she became\nenthused. I also conversed with her about her constructive\nparticipation in his success. After this conversation\nshe arranged for me to meet Mr. Funkhouser.\n\u201cI entered his huge and impressive office determined\nnot to ask directly for a job. He was seated behind a large\ncarved desk and thundered at me, \u2018How about it, young\nman?\' I said, \u2018Mr. Funkhouser, I believe I can make\nmoney for you.\u2019 He immediately rose and invited me to\nsit in one of the large upholstered chairs. I enumerated\nmy ideas and the qualifications I had to realize these\nideas, as well as how they would contribute to his personal\nsuccess and that of his businesses.\n" \'R. J.,\' as he became known to me, hired me at once\nand for over twenty years I have grown in his enterprises\nand we both have prospered.\u201d\nTalking in terms of the other person\u2019s interests pays\noff for both parties. Howard Z. Herzig, a leader in the\nfield of employee communications, has always followed\nthis principle. When asked what reward he got from it,\nMr. Herzig responded that he not only received a different\nreward from each person but that in general the reward\nhad been an enlargement of his life each time he\nspoke to someone.\nPRINCIPLE 5Talk in terms of the other person\u2019s interests.HOW TO MAKE PEOPLE LIKE YOUINSTANTLYI was waiting in line to register a letter in the post office\nat Thirty-third Street and Eighth Avenue in New York. I\nnoticed that the clerk appeared to be bored with the job\n-weighing envelopes, handing out stamps, making\nchange, issuing receipts - the same monotonous grind\nyear after year. So I said to myself: "I am going to try to\nmake that clerk like me. Obviously, to make him like\nme, I must say something nice, not about myself, but\nabout him. So I asked myself, \u2018What is there about him\nthat I can honestly admire?\u2019 " That is sometimes a hard\nquestion to answer, especially with strangers; but, in\nthis case, it happened to be easy. I instantly saw something\nI admired no end.\nSo while he was weighing my envelope, I remarked\nwith enthusiasm: "I certainly wish I had your head of\nhair.\u201d\nHe looked up, half-startled, his face beaming with\nsmiles. "Well, it isn\u2019t as good as it used to be,\u201d he said\nmodestly. I assured him that although it might have lost\nsome of its pristine glory, nevertheless it was still magnificent.\nHe was immensely pleased. We carried on a\npleasant little conversation and the last thing he said to\nme was: \u201cMany people have admired my hair.\u201d\nI\u2019ll bet that person went out to lunch that day walking\non air. I\u2019ll bet he went home that night and told his wife\nabout it. I\u2019ll bet he looked in the mirror and said: \u201cIt is a\nbeautiful head of hair.\u201d\nI told this story once in public and a man asked me\nafterwards: \u201c\u2018What did you want to get out of him?\u201d\nWhat was I trying to get out of him!!! What was I trying\nto get out of him!!!\nIf we are so contemptibly selfish that we can\u2019t radiate\na little happiness and pass on a bit of honest appreciation\nwithout trying to get something out of the other person\nin return - if our souls are no bigger than sour crab apples,\nwe shall meet with the failure we so richly deserve.\nOh yes, I did want something out of that chap. I\nwanted something priceless. And I got it. I got the feeling\nthat I had done something for him without his being\nable to do anything whatever in return for me. That is a\nfeeling that flows and sings in your memory lung after\nthe incident is past.\nThere is one all-important law of human conduct. If\nwe obey that law, we shall almost never get into trouble.\nIn fact, that law, if obeyed, will bring us countless\nfriends and constant happiness. But the very instant we\nbreak the law, we shall get into endless trouble. The law\nis this: Always make the other person feel important.\nJohn Dewey, as we have already noted, said that the\ndesire to be important is the deepest urge in human\nnature; and William James said: \u201cThe deepest principle\nin human nature is the craving to be appreciated.\u201d As I\nhave already pointed out, it is this urge that differentiates\nus from the animals. It is this urge that has been\nresponsible for civilization itself.\nPhilosophers have been speculating on the rules of\nhuman relationships for thousands of years, and out of\nall that speculation, there has evolved only one important\nprecept. It is not new. It is as old as history. Zoroaster\ntaught it to his followers in Persia twenty-five\nhundred years ago. Confucius preached it in China\ntwenty-four centuries ago. Lao-tse, the founder of\nTaoism, taught it to his disciples in the Valley of the\nHan. Buddha preached it on the bank of the Holy\nGanges five hundred years before Christ. The sacred\nbooks of Hinduism taught it a thousand years before\nthat. Jesus taught it among the stony hills of Judea nineteen\ncenturies ago. Jesus summed it up in one thought\n-probably the most important rule in the world: \u201cDo\nunto others as you would have others do unto you.\u201d\nYou want the approval of those with whom you come\nin contact. You want recognition of your true worth. You\nwant a feeling that you are important in your little world.\nYou don\u2019t want to listen to cheap, insincere flattery, but\nyou do crave sincere appreciation. You want your friends\nand associates to be, as Charles Schwab put it, \u201chearty\nin their approbation and lavish in their praise.\u201d All of us\nwant that.\nSo let\u2019s obey the Golden Rule, and give unto others\nwhat we would have others give unto us,\nHow? When? Where? The answer is: All the time,\neverywhere.\nDavid G. Smith of Eau Claire, Wisconsin, told one of\nour classes how he handled a delicate situation when he\nwas asked to take charge of the refreshment booth at a\ncharity concert,\n\u201cThe night of the concert I arrived at the park and\nfound two elderly ladies in a very bad humor standing\nnext to the refreshment stand. Apparently each thought\nthat she was in charge of this project. As I stood there\npondering what to do, me of the members of the sponsoring\ncommittee appeared and handed me a cash\nbox and thanked me for taking over the project. She\nintroduced Rose and Jane as my helpers and then ran\noff.\n"A great silence ensued. Realizing that the cash box\nwas a symbol of authority (of sorts), I gave the box to\nRose and explained that I might not be able to keep the\nmoney straight and that if she took care of it I would feel\nbetter. I then suggested to Jane that she show two teenagers\nwho had been assigned to refreshments how to\noperate the soda machine, and I asked her to be responsible\nfor that part of the project.\n\u201cThe evening was very enjoyable with Rose happily\ncounting the money, Jane supervising the teenagers, and\nme enjoying the concert.\u201d\nYou don\u2019t have to wait until you are ambassador to\nFrance or chairman of the Clambake Committee of your\nlodge before you use this philosophy of appreciation.\nYou can work magic with it almost every day.\nIf, for example, the waitress brings us mashed potatoes\nwhen we have ordered French fried, let\u2019s say: \u201cI\u2019m sorry\nto trouble you, but I prefer French fried.\u201d She\u2019ll probably\nreply, \u201cNo trouble at all\u201d and will be glad to change\nthe potatoes, because we have shown respect for her.\nLittle phrases such as \u201cI\u2019m sorry to trouble you,\u201d\n\u201cWould you be so kind as to ----? " "Won\'t you\nplease?\u201d " Would you mind?\u201d \u201cThank you\u201d - little courtesies\nlike these oil the cogs of the monotonous grind of\neveryday life- and, incidentally, they are the hallmark\nof good breeding.\nLet\u2019s take another illustration. Hall Caine\u2019s novels-The\nChristian, The Deemster, The Manxman, among\nthem - were all best-sellers in the early part of this century.\nMillions of people read his novels, countless millions.\nHe was the son of a blacksmith. He never had\nmore than eight years\u2019 schooling in his life; yet when he\ndied he was the richest literary man of his time.\nThe story goes like this: Hall Caine loved sonnets and\nballads; so he devoured all of Dante Gabriel Rossetti\u2019s\npoetry. He even wrote a lecture chanting the praises of\nRossetti\u2019s artistic achievement-and sent a copy to Rossetti\nhimself. Rossetti was delighted. \u201cAny young man\nwho has such an exalted opinion of my ability,\u201d Rossetti\nprobably said to himself, \u201cmust be brilliant,\u201d So Rossetti\ninvited this blacksmith\u2019s son to come to London and act\nas his secretary. That was the turning point in Hall\nCaine\u2019s life; for, in his new position, he met the literary\nartists of the day. Profiting by their advice and inspired\nby their encouragement, he launched upon a career that\nemblazoned his name across the sky.\nHis home, Greeba Castle, on the Isle of Man, became\na Mecca for tourists from the far corners of the world,\nand he left a multimillion dollar estate. Yet - who knows'),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},'he might have died poor and unknown had he not\nwritten an essay expressing his admiration for a famous\nman.\nSuch is the power, the stupendous power, of sincere,\nheartfelt appreciation.\nRossetti considered himself important. That is not\nstrange, Almost everyone considers himself important,\nvery important.\nThe life of many a person could probably be changed\nif only someone would make him feel important. Ronald\nJ. Rowland, who is one of the instructors of our course\nin California, is also a teacher of arts and crafts. He wrote\nto us about a student named Chris in his beginning\ncrafts class:\nChris was a very quiet, shy boy lacking in self-confidence,\nthe kind of student that often does not receive the\nattention he deserves. I also teach an advanced class that\nhad grown to be somewhat of a status symbol and a privilege\nfor a student to have earned the right to be in it.\nOn Wednesday, Chris was diligently working at his desk.\nI really felt there was a hidden fire deep inside him. I asked\nChris if he would like to be in the advanced class. How I\nwish I could express the look in Chris\u2019s face, the emotions\nin that shy fourteen-year-old boy, trying to hold back his\ntears.\n\u201cWho me, Mr. Rowland? Am I good enough?\u201d\n\u201cYes, Chris, you are good enough.\u201d\nI had to leave at that point because tears were coming to\nmy eyes. As Chris walked out of class that day, seemingly\ntwo inches taller, he looked at me with bright blue eyes and\nsaid in a positive voice, \u201cThank you, Mr. Rowland.\u201d\nChris taught me a lesson I will never forget-our deep\ndesire to feel important. To help me never forget this rule,\nI made a sign which reads \u201cYOU ARE IMPORTANT." This\nsign hangs in the front of the classroom for all to see and to\nremind me that each student I face is equally important.\nThe unvarnished truth is that almost all the people\nyou meet feel themselves superior to you in some way,\nand a sure way to their hearts is to let them realize in\nsome subtle way that you recognize their importance,\nand recognize it sincerely.\nRemember what Emerson said: \u201cEvery man I meet is\nmy superior in some way. In that, I learn of him.\u201d\nAnd the pathetic part of it is that frequently those who\nhave the least justification for a feeling of achievement\nbolster up their egos by a show of tumult and conceit\nwhich is truly nauseating. As Shakespeare put it: ". . .\nman, proud man,/Drest in a little brief authority,/ . . .\nPlays such fantastic tricks before high heaven/As make\nthe angels weep.\u201d\nI am going to tell you how business people in my own\ncourses have applied these principles with remarkable\nresults. Let\u2019s take the case of a Connecticut attorney (because\nof his relatives he prefers not to have his name\nmentioned).\nShortly after joining the course, Mr. R----- drove to\nLong Island with his wife to visit some of her relatives.\nShe left him to chat with an old aunt of hers and ther\nrushed off by herself to visit some of the younger relatives.\nSince he soon had to give a speech professionally\non how he applied the principles of appreciation, he\nthought he would gain some worthwhile experience\ntalking with the-elderly lady. So he looked around the\nhouse to see what he could honestly admire.\n\u201cThis house was built about 1890, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d he inquired.\n\u201cYes,\u201d she replied, \u201cthat is precisely the year it was\nbuilt.\u201d\n\u201cIt reminds me of the house I was born in,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful. Well built. Roomy. You know, they don\u2019t\nbuild houses like this anymore.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d the old lady agreed. \u201cThe young folks\nnowadays don\u2019t care for beautiful homes. All they want\nis a small apartment, and then they go off gadding about\nin their automobiles.\n\u201cThis is a dream house,\u201d she said in a voice vibrating\nwith tender memories. \u201cThis house was built with love.\nMy husband and I dreamed about it for years before we\nbuilt it. We didn\u2019t have an architect. We planned it all\nourselves."\nShe showed Mr. R----- about the house, and he expressed\nhis hearty admiration for the beautiful treasures\nshe had picked up in her travels and cherished over a\nlifetime - paisley shawls, an old English tea set, Wedgwood\nchina, French beds and chairs, Italian paintings,\nand silk draperies that had once hung in a French chateau.\nAfter showing Mr. R----- through the house, she took\nhim out to the garage. There, jacked up on blocks, was a\nPackard car - in mint condition.\n"My husband bought that car for me shortly before he\npassed on,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI have never ridden in it\nsince his death. . . . You appreciate nice things, and I\u2019m\ngoing to give this car to you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy, aunty,\u201d he said, \u201cyou overwhelm me. I appreciate\nyour generosity, of course; but I couldn\u2019t possibly\naccept it. I\u2019m not even a relative of yours. I have a new\ncar, and you have many relatives that would like to have\nthat Packard.\u201d\n\u201cRelatives!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cYes, I have relatives who\nare just waiting till I die so they can get that car. But\nthey are not going to get it.\u201d\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to give it to them, you can very\neasily sell it to a secondhand dealer,\u201d he told her.\n\u201cSell it!\u201d she cried. \u201cDo you think I would sell this\ncar? Do you think I could stand to see strangers riding\nup and down the street in that car - that car that my\nhusband bought for me? I wouldn\u2019t dream of selling it.\nI\u2019m going to give it to you. You appreciate beautiful\nthings."\nHe tried to get out of accepting the car, but he couldn\u2019t\nwithout hurting her feelings.\nThis lady, left all alone in a big house with her paisley\nshawls, her French antiques, and her memories, was\nstarving for a little recognition, She had once been\nyoung and beautiful and sought after She had once built\na house warm with love and had collected things from\nall over Europe to make it beautiful. Now, in the isolated\nloneliness of old age, she craved a little human warmth,\na little genuine appreciation - and no one gave it to her.\nAnd when she found it, like a spring in the desert, her\ngratitude couldn\u2019t adequately express itself with anything\nless than the gift of her cherished Packard.\nLet\u2019s take another case: Donald M. McMahon, who\nwas superintendent of Lewis and Valentine, nurserymen\nand landscape architects in Rye, New York, related\nthis incident:\n\u201cShortly after I attended the talk on \u2018How to Win\nFriends and Influence People,\u2019 I was landscaping the\nestate of a famous attorney. The owner came out to give\nme a few instructions about where he wished to plant a\nmass of rhododendrons and azaleas.\n\u201cI said, \u2018Judge, you have a lovely hobby. I\'ve been\nadmiring your beautiful dogs. I understand you win a lot\nof blue ribbons every year at the show in Madison\nSquare Garden.\u2019\n\u201cThe effect of this little expression of appreciation was\nstriking.\n" \u2018Yes,\u2019 the judge replied, \u2018I do have a lot of fun with\nmy dogs. Would you like to see my kennel?\u2019\n\u201cHe spent almost an hour showing me his dogs and\nthe prizes they had won. He even brought out their\npedigrees and explained about the bloodlines responsible\nfor such beauty and intelligence.\n\u201cFinally, turning to me, he asked: \u2018Do you have any\nsmall children?\u2019\n" \u2018Yes, I do,\u2019 I replied, \u2018I have a son.\u2019\n" \u2018Well, wouldn\u2019t he like a puppy?\u2019 the judge inquired.\n" \u2018Oh, yes, he\u2019d be tickled pink.\u2019\n" \u2018All right, I\u2019m going to give him one,\' the . judge announced.\nHe started to tell me how to feed the puppy. Then he\npaused. \u2018You\u2019ll forget it if I tell you. I\u2019ll write it out.\u2019 So\nthe judge went in the house, typed out the pedigree and\nfeeding instructions, and gave me a puppy worth several\nhundred dollars and one hour and fifteen minutes of his\nvaluable time largely because I had expressed my honest\nadmiration for his hobby and achievements.\u201d\nGeorge Eastman, of Kodak fame, invented the transparent\nfilm that made motion pictures possible, amassed\na fortune of a hundred million dollars, and made himself\none of the most famous businessmen on earth. Yet in\nspite of all these tremendous accomplishments, he\ncraved little recognitions even as you and I.\nTo illustrate: When Eastman was building the Eastman\nSchool of Music and also Kilbourn Hall in Rochester,\nJames Adamson, then president of the Superior\nSeating Company of New York, wanted to get the order\nto supply the theater chairs for these buildings. Phoning\nthe architect, Mr. Adamson made an appointment to see\nMr. Eastman in Rochester.\nWhen Adamson arrived, the architect said: "I know\nyou want to get this order, but I can tell you right now\nthat you won\u2019t stand a ghost of a show if you take more\nthan five minutes of George Eastman\u2019s time. He is a\nstrict disciplinarian. He is very busy. So tell your story\nquickly and get out.\u201d\nAdamson was prepared to do just that.\nWhen he was ushered into the room he saw Mr. Eastman\nbending over a pile of papers at his desk. Presently,\nMr. Eastman looked up, removed his glasses, and\nwalked toward the architect and Mr. Adamson, saying:\n\u201cGood morning, gentlemen, what can I do for you?\u201d\nThe architect introduced them, and then Mr. Adamson\nsaid: \u201cWhile we\u2019ve been waiting for you, Mr. Eastman,\nI\u2019ve been admiring your office. I wouldn\u2019t mind working\nin a room like this myself. I\u2019m in the interior-woodworking\nbusiness, and I never saw a more beautiful office in\nall my life.\u201d\nGeorge Eastman replied: \u201cYou remind me of something\nI had almost forgotten. It is beautiful, isn\u2019t it? I\nenjoyed it a great deal when it was first built. But I come\ndown here now with a lot of other things on my mind\nand sometimes don\u2019t even see the room for weeks at a\ntime ."\nAdamson walked over and rubbed his hand across a\npanel. \u201cThis is English oak, isn\u2019t it? A little different\ntexture from Italian oak.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Eastman replied. \u201cImported English oak. It\nwas selected for me by a friend who specializes in fine\nwoods ."\nThen Eastman showed him about the room, commenting\non the proportions, the coloring, the hand carving\nand other effects he had helped to plan and execute.\nWhile drifting about the room, admiring the wood-work,\nthey paused before a window, and George Eastman,\nin his modest, soft-spoken way, pointed out some\nof the institutions through which he was trying to help\nhumanity: the University of Rochester, the General Hospital,\nthe Homeopathic Hospital, the Friendly Home,\nthe Children\u2019s Hospital. Mr. Adamson congratulated\nhim warmly on the idealistic way he was using his\nwealth to alleviate the sufferings of humanity. Presently,\nGeorge Eastman unlocked a glass case and pulled out\nthe first camera he had ever owned - an invention he\nhad bought from an Englishman.\nAdamson questioned him at length about his early\nstruggles to get started in business, and Mr. Eastman\nspoke with real feeling about the poverty of his childhood,\ntelling how his widowed mother had kept a boardinghouse\nwhile he clerked in an insurance office. The\nterror of poverty haunted him day and night, and he\nresolved to make enough money so that his mother\nwouldn\u2019t have to work, Mr. Adamson drew him out with\nfurther questions and listened, absorbed, while he related\nthe story of his experiments with dry photographic\nplates. He told how he had worked in an office all day,\nand sometimes experimented all night, taking only brief\nnaps while the chemicals were working, sometimes\nworking and sleeping in his clothes for seventy-two\nhours at a stretch.\nJames Adamson had been ushered into Eastman\u2019s office\nat ten-fifteen and had been warned that he must not\ntake more than five minutes; but an hour had passed,\nthen two hours passed. And they were still talking.\nFinally, George Eastman turned to Adamson and said,\n\u201cThe last time I was in Japan I bought some chairs,\nbrought them home, and put them in my sun porch. But\nthe sun peeled the paint, so I went downtown the other\nday and bought some paint and painted the chairs myself.\nWould you like to see what sort of a job I can do\npainting chairs? All right. Come up to my home and have\nlunch with me and I\u2019ll show you.\u201d\nAfter lunch, Mr. Eastman showed Adamson the chairs\nhe had brought from Japan. They weren\u2019t worth more\nthan a few dollars, but George Eastman, now a multimillionaire,\nwas proud of them because he himself had\npainted them.\nThe order for the seats amounted to $90,000. Who do\nyou suppose got the order - James Adamson or one of\nhis competitors?\nFrom the time of this story until Mr. Eastman\u2019s death,\nhe and James Adamson were close friends.\nClaude Marais, a restaurant owner in Rouen, France,\nused this principle and saved his restaurant the loss of a\nkey employee. This woman had been in his employ for\nfive years and was a vital link between M. Marais and\nhis staff of twenty-one people. He was shocked to receive\na registered letter from her advising him of her\nresignation.\nM. Marais reported: "I was very surprised and, even\nmore, disappointed, because I was under the impression\nthat I had been fair to her and receptive to her needs.\nInasmuch as she was a friend as well as an employee, I\nprobably had taken her too much for granted and maybe\nwas even more demanding of her than of other employees.\n"I could not, of course, accept this resignation without\nsome explanation. I took her aside and said, \u2018Paulette,\nyou must understand that I cannot accept your resignation\nYou mean a great deal to me and to this company,\nand you are as important to the success of this restaurant\nas I am.\u2019 I repeated this in front of the entire staff, and I\ninvited her to my home and reiterated my confidence in\nher with my family present.\n\u201cPaulette withdrew her resignation, and today I can\nrely on her as never before. I frequently reinforce this\nby expressing my appreciation for what she does and\nshowing her how important she is to me and to the restaurant.\u201d\n\u201cTalk to people about themselves,\u201d said Disraeli, one\nof the shrewdest men who ever ruled the British Empire.\n\u201cTalk to people about themselves and they will\nlisten for hours ."\nPRINCIPLE 6Make the other person feel important-anddo it sincerely.In a Nutshell\nSIX WAYS TO MAKE PEOPLE LIKE YOU\nPRINCIPLE 1\nBecome genuinely interested in other people.\nPRINCIPLE 2\nSmile.\nPRINCIPLE 3\nRemember that a person\u2019s name is to that person the\nsweetest and most important sound in any language.\nPRINCIPLE 4\nBe a good listener.

I was manager at\nthe time for Sir Ross Smith. During the war, Sir Ross had\nbeen the Australian ace out in Palestine; and shortly\nafter peace was declared, he astonished the world by\nflying halfway around it in thirty days. No such feat had\never been attempted before. It created a tremendous\nsensation. The Australian government awarded him fifty\nthousand dollars; the King of England knighted him;\nand, for a while, he was the most talked-about man\nunder the Union Jack. I was attending a banquet one\nnight given in Sir Ross\u2019s honor; and during the dinner,\nthe man sitting next to me told a humorous story which\nhinged on the quotation \u201cThere\u2019s a divinity that shapes\nour ends, rough-hew them how we will.\u201d\nThe raconteur mentioned that the quotation was from\nthe Bible. He was wrong. I knew that, I knew it positively.\nThere couldn\u2019t be the slightest doubt about it.\nAnd so, to get a feeling of importance and display my\nsuperiority, I appointed myself as an unsolicited and unwelcome\ncommittee of one to correct him. He stuck to\nhis guns. What? From Shakespeare? Impossible! Absurd! That quotation was from the Bible. And he knew it.\nThe storyteller was sitting on my right; and Frank\nGammond, an old friend of mine, was seated at my left.\nMr. Gammond had devoted years to the study of Shakespeare,\nSo the storyteller and I agreed to submit the\nquestion to Mr. Gammond. Mr. Gammond listened,\nkicked me under the table, and then said: \u201cDale, you are\nwrong. The gentleman is right. It is from the Bible.\u201d\nOn our way home that night, I said to Mr. Gammond:\n\u201cFrank, you knew that quotation was from Shakespeare,\u201d\n\u201cYes, of course,\u201d he replied, "Hamlet, Act Five, Scene\nTwo. But we were guests at a festive occasion, my dear\nDale. Why prove to a man he is wrong? Is that going to\nmake him like you? Why not let him save his face? He\ndidn\u2019t ask for your opinion. He didn\u2019t want it. Why argue\nwith him? Always avoid the acute angle.\u201d The man who\nsaid that taught me a lesson I\u2019ll never forget. I not\nonly had made the storyteller uncomfortable, but had\nput my friend in an embarrassing situation. How much\nbetter it would have been had I not become argumentative.\nIt was a sorely needed lesson because I had been an\ninveterate arguer. During my youth, I had argued with\nmy brother about everything under the Milky Way.\nWhen I went to college, I studied logic and argumentation\nand went in for debating contests. Talk about being\nfrom Missouri, I was born there. I had to be shown.\nLater, I taught debating and argumentation in New\nYork; and once, I am ashamed to admit, I planned to\nwrite a book on the subject. Since then, I have listened\nto, engaged in, and watched the effect of thousands of\narguments. As a result of all this, I have come to the\nconclusion that there is only one way under high heaven\nto get the best of an argument - and that is to avoid it .\nAvoid it as you would avoid rattlesnakes and earthquakes.\nNine times out of ten, an argument ends with each of\nthe contestants more firmly convinced than ever that he\nis absolutely right.\nYou can\u2019t win an argument. You can\u2019t because if you\nlose it, you lose it; and if you win it, you lose it. Why?\nWell, suppose you triumph over the other man and shoot\nhis argument full of holes and prove that he is non compos\nmentis. Then what? You will feel fine. But what\nabout him? You have made him feel inferior. You have\nhurt his pride. He will resent your triumph. And -\nA man convinced against his will\nIs of the same opinion still.')))}m.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
