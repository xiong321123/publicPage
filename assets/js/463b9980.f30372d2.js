Neither Dale Carnegie nor\nthe publishers, Simon and Schuster, anticipated more than this\nmodest sale. To their amazement, the book became an overnight\nsensation, and edition after edition rolled off the presses to keep up\nwith the increasing public demand. How to Win Friends and\nInfluence People took its place in publishing history as one of the all\x02time international best-sellers. It touched a nerve and filled a human\nneed that was more than a faddish phenomenon of post-Depression\ndays, as evidenced by its continued and uninterrupted sales into the\neighties, almost half a century later.\nDale Carnegie used to say that it was easier to make a million\ndollars than to put a phrase into the English language. How to Win\nFriends and Influence People became such a phrase: quoted,\nparaphrased, parodied; used in innumerable contexts, from political\ncartoons to novels. The book itself was translated into almost every\nknown written language. Each generation has discovered it anew\nand has found it relevant.\nWhich brings us to the logical question: Why revise a book that has\nproven and continues to prove its vigorous and universal appeal?\nWhy tamper with success?\nTo answer that, we must realize that Dale Carnegie himself was a\ntireless reviser of his own work during his lifetime. How to Win\nFriends and Influence People was written to be used as a textbook\nfor his courses in Effective Speaking and Human Relations and is\nstill used in those courses today. Until his death in 1955 he\nconstantly improved and revised the course itself to make it\napplicable to the evolving needs of an ever-growing public. No one\nwas more sensitive to the changing currents of present-day life than\nDale Carnegie. He constantly improved and refined his methods of\nteaching; he updated his book on effective speaking several times.\nHad he lived longer, he himself would have revised How to Win\nFriends and Influence People to better reflect the changes that have\ntaken place in the world since the thirties.\nMany of the names of prominent people in the book, well known at\nthe time of first publication, are no longer recognized by many of\ntoday\u2019s readers. Certain examples and phrases seem as quaint and\ndated in our social climate as those in a Victorian novel. The\nimportant message and overall impact of the book is weakened to\nthat extent.\nOur purpose, therefore, in this revision is to clarify and strengthen\nthe book for a modern reader without tampering with the content. We\nhave not \u201cchanged\u201d How to Win Friends and Influence People except\nto make a few excisions and add a few more contemporary\nexamples. The brash, breezy Carnegie style is intact\u2014even the\nthirties slang is still there. Dale Carnegie wrote as he spoke, in an\nintensively exuberant, colloquial, conversational manner.\nSo his voice still speaks as forcefully as ever, in the book and in his\nwork. Thousands of people all over the world are being trained in\nCarnegie courses in increasing numbers each year. And other\nthousands are reading and studying How to Win Friends and\nInfluence People and being inspired to use its principles to better\ntheir lives. To all of them we offer this revision in the spirit of the\nhoning and polishing of a finely made tool.\nDorothy Carnegie\n(Mrs. Dale Carnegie), 1981\nHow This Book Was Written\u2014and Why\nDuring the first thirty-five years of the twentieth century, the\npublishing houses of America printed more than a fifth of a million\ndifferent books. Most of them were deadly dull, and many were\nfinancial failures. \u201cMany,\u201d did I say? The president of one of the\nlargest publishing houses in the world confessed to me that his\ncompany, after seventy-five years of publishing experience, still lost\nmoney on seven out of every eight books it published.\nWhy, then, did I have the temerity to write another book? And, after\nI had written it, why should you bother to read it?\nFair questions, both; and I\u2019ll try to answer them.\nI have, since 1912, been conducting educational courses for\nbusiness and professional men and women in New York. At first, I\nconducted courses in public speaking only\u2014courses designed to\ntrain adults, by actual experience, to think on their feet and express\ntheir ideas with more clarity, more effectiveness and more poise,\nboth in business interviews and before groups.\nBut gradually, as the seasons passed, I realized that as sorely as\nthese adults needed training in effective speaking, they needed still\nmore training in the fine art of getting along with people in everyday\nbusiness and social contacts.\nI also gradually realized that I was sorely in need of such training\nmyself. As I look back across the years, I am appalled at my own\nfrequent lack of finesse and understanding. How I wish a book such\nas this had been placed in my hands twenty years ago! What a\npriceless boon it would have been.\nDealing with people is probably the biggest problem you face,\nespecially if you are in business. Yes, and that is also true if you are\na housewife, architect or engineer. Research done a few years ago\nunder the auspices of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement\nof Teaching uncovered a most important and significant fact\u2014a fact\nlater confirmed by additional studies made at the Carnegie Institute\nof Technology. These investigations revealed that even in such\ntechnical lines as engineering, about 15 percent of one\u2019s financial\nsuccess is due to one\u2019s technical knowledge and about 85 percent is\ndue to skill in human engineering\u2014to personality and the ability to\nlead people.\nFor many years, I conducted courses each season at the\nEngineers\u2019 Club of Philadelphia, and also courses for the New York\nchapter of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. A total of\nprobably more than fifteen hundred engineers have passed through\nmy classes. They came to me because they had finally realized,\nafter years of observation and experience, that the highest-paid\npersonnel in engineering are frequently not those who know the\nmost about engineering. One can, for example, hire mere technical\nability in engineering, accountancy, architecture or any other\nprofession at nominal salaries. But the person who has technical\nknowledge plus the ability to express ideas, to assume leadership,\nand to arouse enthusiasm among people\u2014that person is headed for\nhigher earning power.\nIn the heyday of his activity, John D. Rockefeller said that \u201cthe\nability to deal with people is as purchasable a commodity as sugar or\ncoffee. And I will pay more for that ability,\u201d said John D., \u201cthan for any\nother under the sun.\u201d\nWouldn\u2019t you suppose that every college in the land would conduct\ncourses to develop the highest-priced ability under the sun? But if\nthere is just one practical, commonsense course of that kind given\nfor adults in even one college in the land, it has escaped my\nattention up to the present writing.\nThe University of Chicago and the United Y.M.C.A. Schools\nconducted a survey to determine what adults want to study. That\nsurvey cost $25,000 and took two years. The last part of the survey\nwas made in Meriden, Connecticut. It had been chosen as a typical\nAmerican town. Every adult in Meriden was interviewed and\nrequested to answer 156 questions\u2014questions such as \u201cWhat is\nyour business or profession? Your education? How do you spend\nyour spare time? What is your income? Your hobbies? Your\nambitions? Your problems? What subjects are you most interested in\nstudying?,\u201d and so on. That survey revealed that health is the prime\ninterest of adults\u2014and that their second interest is people: how to\nunderstand and get along with people; how to make people like you;\nand how to win others to your way of thinking.\nSo the committee conducting this survey resolved to conduct such\na course for adults in Meriden. They searched diligently for a\npractical textbook on the subject and found\u2014not one. Finally they\napproached one of the world\u2019s outstanding authorities on adult\neducation and asked him if he knew of any book that met the needs\nof this group. \u201cNo,\u201d he replied, \u201cI know what those adults want. But\nthe book they need has never been written.\u201d\nI knew from experience that this statement was true, for I myself\nhad been searching for years to discover a practical, working\nhandbook on human relations.\nSince no such book existed, I have tried to write one for use in my\nown courses. And here it is. I hope you like it.\nIn preparation for this book, I read everything that I could find on\nthe subject\u2014everything from newspaper columns, magazine articles,\nrecords of the family courts, the writings of the old philosophers and\nthe new psychologists. In addition, I hired a trained researcher to\nspend one and a half years in various libraries reading everything I\nhad missed, plowing through erudite tomes on psychology, poring\nover hundreds of magazine articles, searching through countless\nbiographies, trying to ascertain how the great leaders of all ages had\ndealt with people. We read their biographies. We read the life stories\nof all great leaders from Julius Caesar to Thomas Edison. I recall\nthat we read over one hundred biographies of Theodore Roosevelt\nalone. We were determined to spare no time, no expense, to\ndiscover every practical idea that anyone had ever used throughout\nthe ages for winning friends and influencing people.\nI personally interviewed scores of successful people, some of them\nworld-famous\u2014inventors like Marconi and Edison; political leaders\nlike Franklin D. Roosevelt and James Farley; business leaders like\nOwen D. Young; movie stars like Clark Gable and Mary Pickford; and\nexplorers like Martin Johnson\u2014and tried to discover the techniques\nthey used in human relations.\nFrom all this material, I prepared a short talk. I called it \u201cHow to\nWin Friends and Influence People.\u201d I say \u201cshort.\u201d It was short in the\nbeginning, but it soon expanded to a lecture that consumed one hour\nand thirty minutes. For years, I gave this talk each season to the\nadults in the Carnegie Institute courses in New York.\nI gave the talk and urged the listeners to go out and test it in their\nbusiness and social contacts, and then come back to class and\nspeak about their experiences and the results they had achieved.\nWhat an interesting assignment! These men and women, hungry for\nself-improvement, were fascinated by the idea of working in a new\nkind of laboratory\u2014the first and only laboratory of human\nrelationships for adults that had ever existed.\nThis book wasn\u2019t written in the usual sense of the word. It grew as\na child grows. It grew and developed out of that laboratory, out of the\nexperiences of thousands of adults.\nYears ago, we started with a set of rules printed on a card no larger\nthan a postcard. The next season we printed a larger card, then a\nleaflet, then a series of booklets, each one expanding in size and\nscope. After fifteen years of experiment and research came this\nbook.\nThe rules we have set down here are not mere theories or\nguesswork. They work like magic. Incredible as it sounds, I have\nseen the application of these principles literally revolutionize the lives\nof many people.\nTo illustrate: A man with 314 employees joined one of these\ncourses. For years, he had driven and criticized and condemned his\nemployees without stint or discretion. Kindness, words of\nappreciation and encouragement were alien to his lips. After\nstudying the principles discussed in this book, this employer sharply\naltered his philosophy of life. His organization is now inspired with a\nnew loyalty, a new enthusiasm, a new spirit of teamwork. Three\nhundred and fourteen enemies have been turned into 314 friends. As\nhe proudly said in a speech before the class: \u201cWhen I used to walk\nthrough my establishment, no one greeted me. My employees\nactually looked the other way when they saw me approaching. But\nnow they are all my friends and even the janitor calls me by my first\nname.\u201d\nThis employer gained more profit; more leisure and\u2014what is\ninfinitely more important\u2014he found far more happiness in his\nbusiness and in his home.\nCountless numbers of salespeople have sharply increased their\nsales by the use of these principles. Many have opened up new\naccounts\u2014accounts that they had formerly solicited in vain.\nExecutives have been given increased authority, increased pay. One\nexecutive reported a large increase in salary because he applied\nthese truths. Another, an executive in the Philadelphia Gas Works\nCompany, was slated for demotion when he was sixty-five because\nof his belligerence, because of his inability to lead people skillfully.\nThis training not only saved him from the demotion but brought him a\npromotion with increased pay.\nOn innumerable occasions, spouses attending the banquet given\nat the end of the course have told me that their homes have been\nmuch happier since their husbands or wives started this training.\nPeople are frequently astonished at the new results they achieve. It\nall seems like magic. In some cases, in their enthusiasm, they have\ntelephoned me at my home on Sundays because they couldn\u2019t wait\nforty-eight hours to report their achievements at the regular session\nof the course.\nOne man was so stirred by a talk on these principles that he sat far\ninto the night discussing them with other members of the class. At\nthree o\u2019clock in the morning, the others went home. But he was so\nshaken by a realization of his own mistakes, so inspired by the vista\nof a new and richer world opening before him, that he was unable to\nsleep. He didn\u2019t sleep that night or the next day or the next night.\nWho was he? A na\xefve, untrained individual ready to gush over any\nnew theory that came along? No. Far from it. He was a\nsophisticated, blas\xe9 dealer in art, very much the man about town,\nwho spoke three languages fluently and was a graduate of two\nEuropean universities.\nWhile writing this chapter, I received a letter from a German of the\nold school, an aristocrat whose forebears had served for generations\nas professional army officers under the Hohenzollerns. His letter,\nwritten from a transatlantic steamer, telling about the application of\nthese principles, rose almost to a religious fervor.\nAnother man\u2014an old New Yorker, a Harvard graduate, a wealthy\nman, the owner of a large carpet factory\u2014declared he had learned\nmore in fourteen weeks through this system of training about the fine\nart of influencing people than he had learned about the same subject\nduring his four years in college. Absurd? Laughable? Fantastic? Of\ncourse, you are privileged to dismiss this statement with whatever\nadjective you wish. I am merely reporting, without comment, a\ndeclaration made by a conservative and eminently successful\nHarvard graduate in a public address to approximately six hundred\npeople at the Yale Club in New York on the evening of Thursday,\nFebruary 23, 1933.\n\u201cCompared to what we ought to be,\u201d said the famous Professor\nWilliam James of Harvard, \u201ccompared to what we ought to be, we\nare only half awake. We are making use of only a small part of our\nphysical and mental resources. Stating the thing broadly, the human\nindividual thus lives far within his limits. He possesses powers of\nvarious sorts which he habitually fails to use.\u201d\nThose powers which you \u201chabitually fail to use\u201d! The sole purpose\nof this book is to help you discover, develop and profit by those\ndormant and unused assets.\n\u201cEducation,\u201d said Dr. John G. Hibben, former president of Princeton\nUniversity, \u201cis the ability to meet life\u2019s situations.\u201d\nIf by the time you have finished reading the first three chapters of\nthis book\u2014if you aren\u2019t then a little better equipped to meet life\u2019s\nsituations, then I shall consider this book to be a total failure so far\nas you are concerned. For \u201cthe great aim of education,\u201d said Herbert\nSpencer, \u201cis not knowledge but action.\u201d\nAnd this is an action book.\nDale Carnegie, 1936\nNine Suggestions on How to Get the Most Out of\nThis Book"),(0,o.kt)("ol",null,(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"If you wish to get the most out of this book, there is one\nindispensable requirement, one essential infinitely more\nimportant than any rule or technique. Unless you have this one\nfundamental requisite, a thousand rules on how to study will avail\nlittle. And if you do have this cardinal endowment, then you can\nachieve wonders without reading any suggestions for getting the\nmost out of a book.\nWhat is this magic requirement? Just this: a deep, driving\ndesire to learn, a vigorous determination to increase your ability\nto deal with people.\nHow can you develop such an urge? By constantly reminding\nyourself how important these principles are to you. Picture to\nyourself how their mastery will aid you in leading a richer, fuller,\nhappier and more fulfilling life. Say to yourself over and over: \u201cMy\npopularity, my happiness and sense of worth depend to no small\nextent upon my skill in dealing with people.\u201d"),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Read each chapter rapidly at first to get a bird\u2019s-eye view of it.\nYou will probably be tempted then to rush on to the next one. But\ndon\u2019t\u2014unless you are reading merely for entertainment. But if\nyou are reading because you want to increase your skill in human\nrelations, then go back and reread each chapter thoroughly.

I knew a woman who had been office manager for a large\ninsurance concern for fifteen years. Every month, she read all the\ninsurance contracts her company had issued that month. Yes,\nshe read many of the same contracts over month after month,\nyear after year. Why? Because experience had taught her that\nthat was the only way she could keep their provisions clearly in\nmind.\nI once spent almost two years writing a book on public\nspeaking and yet I found I had to keep going back over it from\ntime to time in order to remember what I had written in my own\nbook. The rapidity with which we forget is astonishing.\nSo, if you want to get a real, lasting benefit out of this book,\ndon\u2019t imagine that skimming through it once will suffice. After\nreading it thoroughly, you ought to spend a few hours reviewing it\nevery month. Keep it on your desk in front of you every day.\nGlance through it often. Keep constantly impressing yourself with\nthe rich possibilities for improvement that still lie in the offing.\nRemember that the use of these principles can be made habitual\nonly by a constant and vigorous campaign of review and\napplication. There is no other way.\n6. Bernard Shaw once remarked: \u201cIf you teach a man anything, he\nwill never learn.\u201d Shaw was right. Learning is an active process.\nWe learn by doing. So, if you desire to master the principles you\nare studying in this book, do something about them. Apply these\nrules at every opportunity. If you don\u2019t you will forget them quickly.\nOnly knowledge that is used sticks in your mind.\nYou will probably find it difficult to apply these suggestions all\nthe time. I know because I wrote the book, and yet frequently I\nfound it difficult to apply everything I advocated. For example,\nwhen you are displeased, it is much easier to criticize and\ncondemn than it is to try to understand the other person\u2019s\nviewpoint; it is frequently easier to find fault than to find praise; it\nis more natural to talk about what you want than to talk about\nwhat the other person wants; and so on. So, as you read this\nbook, remember that you are not merely trying to acquire\ninformation. You are attempting to form new habits. Ah yes, you\nare attempting a new way of life. That will require time and\npersistence and daily application.\nSo refer to these pages often. Regard this as a working\nhandbook on human relations; and whenever you are confronted\nwith some specific problem\u2014such as handling a child, winning\nyour spouse to your way of thinking, or satisfying an irritated\ncustomer\u2014hesitate about doing the natural thing, the impulsive\nthing. This is usually wrong. Instead, turn to these pages and\nreview the paragraphs you have underscored. Then try these\nnew ways and watch them achieve magic for you.\n7. Offer your spouse, your child or some business associate a dime\nor a dollar every time he or she catches you violating a certain\nprinciple. Make a lively game out of mastering these rules.\n8. The president of an important Wall Street bank once described,\nin a talk before one of my classes, a highly efficient system he\nused for self-improvement. This man had little formal schooling;\nyet he had become one of the most important financiers in\nAmerica, and he confessed that he owed most of his success to\nthe constant application of his homemade system. This is what\nhe does. I\u2019ll put it in his own words as accurately as I can\nremember.\n\u201cFor years I have kept an engagement book showing all the\nappointments I had during the day. My family never made any\nplans for me on Saturday night, for the family knew that I devoted\na part of each Saturday evening to the illuminating process of\nself-examination and review and appraisal. After dinner I went off\nby myself, opened my engagement book, and thought over all the\ninterviews, discussions and meetings that had taken place during\nthe week. I asked myself:\n\u201c\u2018What mistakes did I make that time?\u2019\n\u201c\u2018What did I do that was right\u2014and in what way could I have\nimproved my performance?\u2019\n\u201c\u2018What lessons can I learn from that experience?\u2019\n\u201cI often found that this weekly review made me very unhappy. I\nwas frequently astonished at my own blunders. Of course, as the\nyears passed, these blunders became less frequent. Sometimes I\nwas inclined to pat myself on the back a little after one of these\nsessions. This system of self-analysis, self-education, continued\nyear after year, did more for me than any other one thing I have\never attempted.\n\u201cIt helped me improve my ability to make decisions\u2014and it\naided me enormously in all my contacts with people. I cannot\nrecommend it too highly.\u201d\nWhy not use a similar system to check up on your application\nof the principles discussed in this book? If you do, two things will\nresult.\nFirst, you will find yourself engaged in an educational process\nthat is both intriguing and priceless.\nSecond, you will find that your ability to meet and deal with\npeople will grow enormously.\n9. You will find at the end of this book blank pages on which you\nshould record your triumphs in the application of these principles.\nBe specific. Give names, dates, results. Keeping such a record\nwill inspire you to greater efforts; and how fascinating these\nentries will be when you chance upon them some evening years\nfrom now!\nIN ORDER TO GET THE MOST\nOUT OF THIS BOOK:\na.

After weeks of search, \u201cTwo\nGun\u201d Crowley\u2014the killer, the gunman who didn\u2019t smoke or drink\u2014\nwas at bay, trapped in his sweetheart\u2019s apartment on West End\nAvenue.\nOne hundred and fifty policemen and detectives laid siege to his\ntop-floor hideaway. They chopped holes in the roof; they tried to\nsmoke out Crowley, the \u201ccop killer,\u201d with tear gas. Then they\nmounted their machine guns on surrounding buildings, and for more\nthan an hour one of New York\u2019s fine residential areas reverberated\nwith the crack of pistol fire and the rat-tat-tat of machine guns.\nCrowley, crouching behind an overstuffed chair, fired incessantly at\nthe police. Ten thousand excited people watched the battle. Nothing\nlike it had ever been seen before on the sidewalks of New York.\nWhen Crowley was captured, Police Commissioner E. P.\nMulrooney declared that the two-gun desperado was one of the most\ndangerous criminals ever encountered in the history of New York.\n\u201cHe will kill,\u201d said the Commissioner, \u201cat the drop of a feather.\u201d\nBut how did \u201cTwo Gun\u201d Crowley regard himself? We know,\nbecause while the police were firing into his apartment, he wrote a\nletter addressed \u201cTo whom it may concern.\u201d And, as he wrote, the\nblood flowing from his wounds left a crimson trail on the paper. In his\nletter Crowley said: \u201cUnder my coat is a weary heart, but a kind one\n\u2014one that would do nobody any harm.\u201d\nA short time before this, Crowley had been having a necking party\nwith his girl friend on a country road out on Long Island. Suddenly a\npoliceman walked up to the car and said: \u201cLet me see your license.\u201d\nWithout saying a word, Crowley drew his gun and cut the\npoliceman down with a shower of lead. As the dying officer fell,\nCrowley leaped out of the car, grabbed the officer\u2019s revolver, and\nfired another bullet into the prostrate body. And that was the killer\nwho said: \u201cUnder my coat is a weary heart, but a kind one\u2014one that\nwould do nobody any harm.\u201d\nCrowley was sentenced to the electric chair. When he arrived at\nthe death house in Sing Sing, did he say, \u201cThis is what I get for killing\npeople\u201d? No, he said: \u201cThis is what I get for defending myself.\u201d\nThe point of the story is this: \u201cTwo Gun\u201d Crowley didn\u2019t blame\nhimself for anything.\nIs that an unusual attitude among criminals? If you think so, listen\nto this:\n\u201cI have spent the best years of my life giving people the lighter\npleasures, helping them have a good time, and all I get is abuse, the\nexistence of a hunted man.\u201d\nThat\u2019s Al Capone speaking. Yes, America\u2019s most notorious Public\nEnemy\u2014the most sinister gang leader who ever shot up Chicago.\nCapone didn\u2019t condemn himself. He actually regarded himself as a\npublic benefactor\u2014an unappreciated and misunderstood public\nbenefactor.\nAnd so did Dutch Schultz before he crumpled up under gangster\nbullets in Newark. Dutch Schultz, one of New York\u2019s most notorious\nrats, said in a newspaper interview that he was a public benefactor.\nAnd he believed it.\nI have had some interesting correspondence with Lewis Lawes,\nwho was warden of New York\u2019s infamous Sing Sing prison for many\nyears, on this subject, and he declared that \u201cfew of the criminals in\nSing Sing regard themselves as bad men. They are just as human\nas you and I. So they rationalize, they explain. They can tell you why\nthey had to crack a safe or be quick on the trigger finger. Most of\nthem attempt by a form of reasoning, fallacious or logical, to justify\ntheir antisocial acts even to themselves, consequently stoutly\nmaintaining that they should never have been imprisoned at all.\u201d\nIf Al Capone, \u201cTwo Gun\u201d Crowley, Dutch Schultz, and the\ndesperate men and women behind prison walls don\u2019t blame\nthemselves for anything\u2014what about the people with whom you and\nI come in contact?\nJohn Wanamaker, founder of the stores that bear his name, once\nconfessed: \u201cI learned thirty years ago that it is foolish to scold. I have\nenough trouble overcoming my own limitations without fretting over\nthe fact that God has not seen fit to distribute evenly the gift of\nintelligence.\u201d\nWanamaker learned this lesson early, but I personally had to\nblunder through this old world for a third of a century before it even\nbegan to dawn upon me that ninety-nine times out of a hundred,\npeople don\u2019t criticize themselves for anything, no matter how wrong\nit may be.\nCriticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and\nusually makes him strive to justify himself. Criticism is dangerous,\nbecause it wounds a person\u2019s precious pride, hurts his sense of\nimportance, and arouses resentment.\nB. F. Skinner, the world-famous psychologist, proved through his\nexperiments that an animal rewarded for good behavior will learn\nmuch more rapidly and retain what it learns far more effectively than\nan animal punished for bad behavior. Later studies have shown that\nthe same applies to humans. By criticizing, we do not make lasting\nchanges and often incur resentment.\nHans Selye, another great psychologist, said, \u201cAs much as we\nthirst for approval, we dread condemnation.\u201d\nThe resentment that criticism engenders can demoralize\nemployees, family members and friends, and still not correct the\nsituation that has been condemned.\nGeorge B. Johnston of Enid, Oklahoma, is the safety coordinator\nfor an engineering company. One of his responsibilities is to see that\nemployees wear their hard hats whenever they are on the job in the\nfield. He reported that whenever he came across workers who were\nnot wearing hard hats, he would tell them with a lot of authority of the\nregulation and that they must comply. As a result he would get sullen\nacceptance, and often after he left, the workers would remove the\nhats.\nHe decided to try a different approach. The next time he found\nsome of the workers not wearing their hard hat, he asked if the hats\nwere uncomfortable or did not fit properly. Then he reminded the\nmen in a pleasant tone of voice that the hat was designed to protect\nthem from injury and suggested that it always be worn on the job.\nThe result was increased compliance with the regulation with no\nresentment or emotional upset.\nYou will find examples of the futility of criticism bristling on a\nthousand pages of history. Take, for example, the famous quarrel\nbetween Theodore Roosevelt and President Taft\u2014a quarrel that split\nthe Republican party, put Woodrow Wilson in the White House, and\nwrote bold, luminous lines across the First World War and altered the\nflow of history. Let\u2019s review the facts quickly. When Theodore\nRoosevelt stepped out of the White House in 1908, he supported\nTaft, who was elected President. Then Theodore Roosevelt went off\nto Africa to shoot lions. When he returned, he exploded. He\ndenounced Taft for his conservatism, tried to secure the nomination\nfor a third term himself, formed the Bull Moose party, and all but\ndemolished the G.O.P. In the election that followed, William Howard\nTaft and the Republican party carried only two states\u2014Vermont and\nUtah. The most disastrous defeat the party had ever known.\nTheodore Roosevelt blamed Taft, but did President Taft blame\nhimself? Of course not. With tears in his eyes, Taft said: \u201cI don\u2019t see\nhow I could have done any differently from what I have.\u201d\nWho was to blame? Roosevelt or Taft? Frankly, I don\u2019t know, and I\ndon\u2019t care. The point I am trying to make is that all of Theodore\nRoosevelt\u2019s criticism didn\u2019t persuade Taft that he was wrong. It\nmerely made Taft strive to justify himself and to reiterate with tears in\nhis eyes: \u201cI don\u2019t see how I could have done any differently from\nwhat I have.\u201d\nOr, take the Teapot Dome oil scandal. It kept the newspapers\nringing with indignation in the early 1920s. It rocked the nation!\nWithin the memory of living men, nothing like it had ever happened\nbefore in American public life. Here are the bare facts of the scandal:\nAlbert B. Fall, secretary of the interior in Harding\u2019s cabinet, was\nentrusted with the leasing of government oil reserves at Elk Hill and\nTeapot Dome\u2014oil reserves that had been set aside for the future\nuse of the Navy. Did Secretary Fall permit competitive bidding? No\nsir. He handed the fat, juicy contract outright to his friend Edward L.\nDoheny. And what did Doheny do? He gave Secretary Fall what he\nwas pleased to call a \u201cloan\u201d of one hundred thousand dollars. Then,\nin a high-handed manner, Secretary Fall ordered United States\nMarines into the district to drive off competitors whose adjacent wells\nwere sapping oil out of the Elk Hill reserves. These competitors,\ndriven off their ground at the ends of guns and bayonets, rushed into\ncourt\u2014and blew the lid off the Teapot Dome scandal. A stench arose\nso vile that it ruined the Harding Administration, nauseated an entire\nnation, threatened to wreck the Republican party, and put Albert B.\nFall behind prison bars.\nFall was condemned viciously\u2014condemned as few men in public\nlife have ever been. Did he repent? Never! Years later Herbert\nHoover intimated in a public speech that President Harding\u2019s death\nhad been due to mental anxiety and worry because a friend had\nbetrayed him. When Mrs. Fall heard that, she sprang from her chair,\nshe wept, she shook her fists at fate and screamed: \u201cWhat! Harding\nbetrayed by Fall? No! My husband never betrayed anyone. This\nwhole house full of gold would not tempt my husband to do wrong.\nHe is the one who has been betrayed and led to the slaughter and\ncrucified.\u201d\nThere you are; human nature in action, wrongdoers, blaming\neverybody but themselves. We are all like that. So when you and I\nare tempted to criticize someone tomorrow, let\u2019s remember Al\nCapone, \u201cTwo Gun\u201d Crowley and Albert Fall. Let\u2019s realize that\ncriticisms are like homing pigeons. They always return home. Let\u2019s\nrealize that the person we are going to correct and condemn will\nprobably justify himself or herself, and condemn us in return; or, like\nthe gentle Taft, will say: \u201cI don\u2019t see how I could have done any\ndifferently from what I have.\u201d\nOn the morning of April 15, 1865, Abraham Lincoln lay dying in a\nhall bedroom of a cheap lodging house directly across the street\nfrom Ford\u2019s Theater, where John Wilkes Booth had shot him.\nLincoln\u2019s long body lay stretched diagonally across a sagging bed\nthat was too short for him. A cheap reproduction of Rosa Bonheur\u2019s\nfamous painting The Horse Fair hung above the bed, and a dismal\ngas jet flickered yellow light.\nAs Lincoln lay dying, Secretary of War Stanton said, \u201cThere lies the\nmost perfect ruler of men that the world has ever seen.\u201d\nWhat was the secret of Lincoln\u2019s success in dealing with people? I\nstudied the life of Abraham Lincoln for ten years and devoted all of\nthree years to writing and rewriting a book entitled Lincoln the\nUnknown. I believe I have made as detailed and exhaustive a study\nof Lincoln\u2019s personality and home life as it is possible for any being\nto make. I made a special study of Lincoln\u2019s method of dealing with\npeople. Did he indulge in criticism? Oh, yes. As a young man in the\nPigeon Creek Valley of Indiana, he not only criticized but he wrote\nletters and poems ridiculing people and dropped these letters on the\ncountry roads where they were sure to be found. One of these letters\naroused resentments that burned for a lifetime.\nEven after Lincoln had become a practicing lawyer in Springfield,\nIllinois, he attacked his opponents openly in letters published in the\nnewspapers. But he did this just once too often.\nIn the autumn of 1842 he ridiculed a vain, pugnacious politician by\nthe name of James Shields. Lincoln lampooned him through an\nanonymous letter published in the Springfield Journal. The town\nroared with laughter. Shields, sensitive and proud, boiled with\nindignation. He found out who wrote the letter, leaped on his horse,\nstarted after Lincoln, and challenged him to fight a duel. Lincoln\ndidn\u2019t want to fight. He was opposed to dueling, but he couldn\u2019t get\nout of it and save his honor. He was given the choice of weapons.\nSince he had very long arms, he chose cavalry broadswords and\ntook lessons in sword fighting from a West Point graduate; and, on\nthe appointed day, he and Shields met on a sandbar in the\nMississippi River, prepared to fight to the death; but, at the last\nminute, their seconds interrupted and stopped the duel.\nThat was the most lurid personal incident in Lincoln\u2019s life. It taught\nhim an invaluable lesson in the art of dealing with people. Never\nagain did he write an insulting letter. Never again did he ridicule\nanyone. And from that time on, he almost never criticized anybody\nfor anything.\nTime after time, during the Civil War, Lincoln put a new general at\nthe head of the Army of the Potomac, and each one in turn\u2014\nMcClellan, Pope, Burnside, Hooker, Meade\u2014blundered tragically\nand drove Lincoln to pacing the floor in despair. Half the nation\nsavagely condemned these incompetent generals, but Lincoln, \u201cwith\nmalice toward none, with charity for all,\u201d held his peace. One of his\nfavorite quotations was \u201cJudge not, that ye be not judged.\u201d\nAnd when Mrs. Lincoln and others spoke harshly of the southern\npeople, Lincoln replied: \u201cDon\u2019t criticize them; they are just what we\nwould be under similar circumstances.\u201d\nYet if any man ever had occasion to criticize, surely it was Lincoln.\nLet\u2019s take just one illustration:\nThe Battle of Gettysburg was fought during the first three days of\nJuly 1863. During the night of July 4, Lee began to retreat southward\nwhile storm clouds deluged the country with rain. When Lee reached\nthe Potomac with his defeated army, he found a swollen, impassable\nriver in front of him, and a victorious Union Army behind him. Lee\nwas in a trap. He couldn\u2019t escape. Lincoln saw that. Here was a\ngolden, heaven-sent opportunity\u2014the opportunity to capture Lee\u2019s\narmy and end the war immediately. So, with a surge of high hope,\nLincoln ordered Meade not to call a council of war but to attack Lee\nimmediately. Lincoln telegraphed his orders and then sent a special\nmessenger to Meade demanding immediate action.\nAnd what did General Meade do? He did the very opposite of what\nhe was told to do. He called a council of war in direct violation of\nLincoln\u2019s orders. He hesitated. He procrastinated. He telegraphed all\nmanner of excuses. He refused point-blank to attack Lee. Finally the\nwaters receded and Lee escaped over the Potomac with his forces.\nLincoln was furious. \u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d Lincoln cried to his\nson Robert. \u201cGreat God! What does this mean? We had them within\nour grasp, and had only to stretch forth our hands and they were\nours; yet nothing that I could say or do could make the army move.\nUnder the circumstances, almost any general could have defeated\nLee. If I had gone up there, I could have whipped him myself.\u201d\nIn bitter disappointment, Lincoln sat down and wrote Meade this\nletter. And remember, at this period of his life Lincoln was extremely\nconservative and restrained in his phraseology. So this letter coming\nfrom Lincoln in 1863 was tantamount to the severest rebuke.\nMy dear General,\nI do not believe you appreciate the magnitude of the\nmisfortune involved in Lee\u2019s escape. He was within our easy\ngrasp, and to have closed upon him would, in connection with\nour other late successes, have ended the war. As it is, the war\nwill be prolonged indefinitely. If you could not safely attack Lee\nlast Monday, how can you possibly do so south of the river, when\nyou can take with you very few\u2014no more than two-thirds of the\nforce you then had in hand? It would be unreasonable to expect\nand I do not expect that you can now effect much. Your golden\nopportunity is gone, and I am distressed immeasurably because\nof it.\nWhat do you suppose Meade did when he read the letter?\nMeade never saw that letter. Lincoln never mailed it. It was found\namong his papers after his death.\nMy guess is\u2014and this is only a guess\u2014that after writing that letter,\nLincoln looked out of the window and said to himself, \u201cJust a minute.\nMaybe I ought not to be so hasty. It is easy enough for me to sit here\nin the quiet of the White House and order Meade to attack; but if I\nhad been up at Gettysburg, and if I had seen as much blood as\nMeade has seen during the last week, and if my ears had been\npierced with the screams and shrieks of the wounded and dying,\nmaybe I wouldn\u2019t be so anxious to attack either. If I had Meade\u2019s\ntimid temperament, perhaps I would have done just what he had\ndone. Anyhow, it is water under the bridge now. If I send this letter, it\nwill relieve my feelings, but it will make Meade try to justify himself. It\nwill make him condemn me. It will arouse hard feelings, impair all his\nfurther usefulness as a commander, and perhaps force him to resign\nfrom the army.\u201d\nSo, as I have already said, Lincoln put the letter aside, for he had\nlearned by bitter experience that sharp criticisms and rebukes almost\ninvariably end in futility.\nTheodore Roosevelt said that when he, as President, was\nconfronted with a perplexing problem, he used to lean back and look\nup at a large painting of Lincoln which hung above his desk in the\nWhite House and ask himself, \u201cWhat would Lincoln do if he were in\nmy shoes? How would he solve this problem?\u201d\nThe next time we are tempted to admonish somebody, let\u2019s pull a\nfive-dollar bill out of our pocket, look at Lincoln\u2019s picture on the bill,\nand ask, \u201cHow would Lincoln handle this problem if he had it?\u201d\nMark Twain lost his temper occasionally and wrote letters that\nturned the paper brown. For example, he once wrote to a man who\nhad aroused his ire: \u201cThe thing for you is a burial permit. You have\nonly to speak and I will see that you get it.\u201d On another occasion he\nwrote to an editor about a proofreader\u2019s attempts to \u201cimprove my\nspelling and punctuation.\u201d He ordered: \u201cSet the matter according to\nmy copy hereafter and see that the proofreader retains his\nsuggestions in the mush of his decayed brain.\u201d\nThe writing of these stinging letters made Mark Twain feel better.\nThey allowed him to blow off steam, and the letters didn\u2019t do any real\nharm, because Mark Twain\u2019s wife secretly lifted them out of the mail.\nThey were never sent.\nDo you know someone you would like to change and regulate and\nimprove? Good! That is fine. I am all in favor of it. But why not begin\non yourself? From a purely selfish standpoint, that is a lot more\nprofitable than trying to improve others\u2014yes, and a lot less\ndangerous. \u201cDon\u2019t complain about the snow on your neighbor\u2019s roof,\u201d\nsaid Confucius, \u201cwhen your own doorstep is unclean.\u201d\nWhen I was still young and trying hard to impress people, I wrote a\nfoolish letter to Richard Harding Davis, an author who once loomed\nlarge on the literary horizon of America. I was preparing a magazine\narticle about authors, and I asked Davis to tell me about his method\nof work. A few weeks earlier, I had received a letter from someone\nwith this notation at the bottom: \u201cDictated but not read.\u201d I was quite\nimpressed. I felt that the writer must be very big and busy and\nimportant. I wasn\u2019t the slightest bit busy, but I was eager to make an\nimpression on Richard Harding Davis, so I ended my short note with\nthe words: \u201cDictated but not read.\u201d\nHe never troubled to answer the letter. He simply returned it to me\nwith this scribbled across the bottom: \u201cYour bad manners are\nexceeded only by your bad manners.\u201d True, I had blundered, and\nperhaps I deserved this rebuke. But, being human, I resented it. I\nresented it so sharply that when I read of the death of Richard\nHarding Davis ten years later, the one thought that still persisted in\nmy mind\u2014I an ashamed to admit\u2014was the hurt he had given me.\nIf you and I want to stir up a resentment tomorrow that may rankle\nacross the decades and endure until death, just let us indulge in a\nlittle stinging criticism\u2014no matter how certain we are that it is\njustified.\nWhen dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with\ncreatures of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion,\ncreatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.\nBitter criticism caused the sensitive Thomas Hardy, one of the\nfinest novelists ever to enrich English literature, to give up forever\nthe writing of fiction. Criticism drove Thomas Chatterton, the English\npoet, to suicide.\nBenjamin Franklin, tactless in his youth, became so diplomatic, so\nadroit at handling people, that he was made American Ambassador\nto France. The secret of his success? \u201cI will speak ill of no man,\u201d he\nsaid, \u201c. . . and speak all the good I know of everybody.\u201d\nAny fool can criticize, condemn and complain\u2014and most fools do.\nBut it takes character and self-control to be understanding and\nforgiving.\n\u201cA great man shows his greatness,\u201d said Carlyle, \u201cby the way he\ntreats little men.\u201d\nBob Hoover, a famous test pilot and frequent performer at air\nshows, was returning to his home in Los Angeles from an air show in\nSan Diego. As described in the magazine Flight Operations, at three\nhundred feet in the air, both engines suddenly stopped. By deft\nmaneuvering he managed to land the plane, but it was badly\ndamaged although nobody was hurt.\nHoover\u2019s first act after the emergency landing was to inspect the\nairplane\u2019s fuel. Just as he suspected, the World War II propeller\nplane he had been flying had been fueled with jet fuel rather than\ngasoline.\nUpon returning to the airport, he asked to see the mechanic who\nhad serviced his airplane. The young man was sick with the agony of\nhis mistake. Tears streamed down his face as Hoover approached.\nHe had just caused the loss of a very expensive plane and could\nhave caused the loss of three lives as well.\nYou can imagine Hoover\u2019s anger. One could anticipate the tongue\x02lashing that this proud and precise pilot would unleash for that\ncarelessness. But Hoover didn\u2019t scold the mechanic; he didn\u2019t even\ncriticize him. Instead, he put his big arm around the man\u2019s shoulder\nand said, \u201cTo show you I\u2019m sure that you\u2019ll never do this again, I want\nyou to service my F-51 tomorrow.\u201d\nOften parents are tempted to criticize their children. You would\nexpect me to say \u201cdon\u2019t.\u201d But I will not. I am merely going to say,\n\u201cBefore you criticize them, read one of the classics of American\njournalism, \u2018Father Forgets.\u2019\u201d It originally appeared as an editorial in\nthe People\u2019s Home Journal. We are reprinting it here with the\nauthor\u2019s permission, as condensed in the Reader\u2019s Digest:\n\u201cFather Forgets\u201d is one of those little pieces which\u2014dashed off in a\nmoment of sincere feeling\u2014strikes an echoing chord in so many\nreaders as to become a perennial reprint favorite. Since its first\nappearance, \u201cFather Forgets\u201d has been reproduced, writes the\nauthor, W. Livingston Larned, \u201cin hundreds of magazines and house\norgans, and in newspapers the country over. It has been reprinted\nalmost as extensively in many foreign languages. I have given\npersonal permission to thousands who wished to read it from school,\nchurch, and lecture platforms. It has been \u2018on the air\u2019 on countless\noccasions and programs. Oddly enough, college periodicals have\nused it, and high-school magazines. Sometimes a little piece seems\nmysteriously to \u2018click.\u2019 This one certainly did.\u201d\nFATHER FORGETS\nW. Livingston Larned\nListen, son: I am saying this as you lie asleep, one little paw\ncrumpled under your cheek and the blond curls stickily wet on\nyour damp forehead. I have stolen into your room alone. Just a\nfew minutes ago, as I sat reading my paper in the library, a\nstifling wave of remorse swept over me. Guiltily I came to your\nbedside.\nThere are the things I was thinking, son: I had been cross to\nyou. I scolded you as you were dressing for school because you\ngave your face merely a dab with a towel. I took you to task for\nnot cleaning your shoes. I called out angrily when you threw\nsome of your things on the floor.\nAt breakfast I found fault, too. You spilled things. You gulped\ndown your food. You put your elbows on the table. You spread\nbutter too thick on your bread. And as you started off to play and\nI made for my train, you turned and waved a hand and called,\n\u201cGoodbye, Daddy!\u201d and I frowned, and said in reply, \u201cHold your\nshoulders back!\u201d\nThen it began all over again in the late afternoon. As I came\nup the road I spied you, down on your knees, playing marbles.\nThere were holes in your stockings. I humiliated you before your\nboyfriends by marching you ahead of me to the house.\nStockings were expensive\u2014and if you had to buy them you\nwould be more careful! Imagine that, son, from a father!\nDo you remember, later, when I was reading in the library, how\nyou came in timidly, with a sort of hurt look in your eyes? When I\nglanced up over my paper, impatient at the interruption, you\nhesitated at the door. \u201cWhat is it you want?\u201d I snapped.\nYou said nothing, but ran across in one tempestuous plunge,\nand threw your arms around my neck and kissed me, and your\nsmall arms tightened with an affection that God had set blooming\nin your heart and which even neglect could not wither. And then\nyou were gone, pattering up the stairs.\nWell, son, it was shortly afterwards that my paper slipped from\nmy hands and a terrible sickening fear came over me. What has\nhabit been doing to me? The habit of finding fault, of\nreprimanding\u2014this was my reward to you for being a boy. It was\nnot that I did not love you; it was that I expected too much of\nyouth. I was measuring you by the yardstick of my own years.\nAnd there was so much that was good and fine and true in\nyour character. The little heart of you was as big as the dawn\nitself over the wide hills. This was shown by your spontaneous\nimpulse to rush in and kiss me good night. Nothing else matters\ntonight, son. I have come to your bedside in the darkness, and I\nhave knelt there, ashamed!\nIt is a feeble atonement; I know you would not understand\nthese things if I told them to you during your waking hours. But\ntomorrow I will be a real daddy! I will chum with you, and suffer\nwhen you suffer, and laugh when you laugh. I will bite my tongue\nwhen impatient words come. I will keep saying as if it were a\nritual: \u201cHe is nothing but a boy\u2014a little boy!\u201d\nI am afraid I have visualized you as a man. Yet as I see you\nnow, son, crumpled and weary in your cot, I see that you are still\na baby. Yesterday you were in your mother\u2019s arms, your head on\nher shoulder. I have asked too much, too much.\nInstead of condemning people, let\u2019s try to understand them. Let\u2019s\ntry to figure out why they do what they do. That\u2019s a lot more\nprofitable and intriguing than criticism; and it breeds sympathy,\ntolerance and kindness. \u201cTo know all is to forgive all.\u201d\nAs Dr. Johnson said: \u201cGod himself, sir, does not propose to judge\nman until the end of his days.\u201d\nWhy should you and I?\nPRINCIPLE 1\nDon\u2019t criticize, condemn or complain.\n2\nThe Big Secret of Dealing with People\nThere is only one way under high heaven to get anybody to do\nanything. Did you ever stop to think of that? Yes, just one way. And\nthat is by making the other person want to do it.\nRemember, there is no other way.\nOf course, you can make someone want to give you his watch by\nsticking a revolver in his ribs. You can make your employees give\nyou cooperation\u2014until your back is turned\u2014by threatening to fire\nthem. You can make a child do what you want it to do by a whip or a\nthreat. But these crude methods have sharply undesirable\nrepercussions.\nThe only way I can get you to do anything is by giving you what\nyou want.\nWhat do you want?\nSigmund Freud said that everything you and I do springs from two\nmotives: the sex urge and the desire to be great.\nJohn Dewey, one of America\u2019s most profound philosophers,\nphrased it a bit differently. Dr. Dewey said that the deepest urge in\nhuman nature is \u201cthe desire to be important.\u201d Remember that phrase:\n\u201cthe desire to be important.\u201d It is significant. You are going to hear a\nlot about it in this book.\nWhat do you want? Not many things, but the few things that you do\nwish, you crave with an insistence that will not be denied. Some of\nthe things most people want include:"),(0,o.kt)("ol",null,(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Health and the preservation of life"),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Food"),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Sleep"),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Money and the things money will buy"),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Life in the hereafter"),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Sexual gratification"),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"The well-being of our children"),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"A feeling of importance\nAlmost all these wants are usually gratified\u2014all except one. But\nthere is one longing\u2014almost as deep, almost as imperious, as the\ndesire for food or sleep\u2014which is seldom gratified. It is what Freud\ncalls \u201cthe desire to be great.\u201d It is what Dewey calls the \u201cdesire to be\nimportant.\u201d\nLincoln once began a letter saying: \u201cEverybody likes a\ncompliment.\u201d William James said: \u201cThe deepest principle in human\nnature is the craving to be appreciated.\u201d He didn\u2019t speak, mind you,\nof the \u201cwish\u201d or the \u201cdesire\u201d or the \u201clonging\u201d to be appreciated. He\nsaid the \u201ccraving\u201d to be appreciated.\nHere is a gnawing and unfaltering human hunger, and the rare\nindividual who honestly satisfies this heart hunger will hold people in\nthe palm of his or her hand and \u201ceven the undertaker will be sorry\nwhen he dies.\u201d\nThe desire for a feeling of importance is one of the chief\ndistinguishing differences between mankind and the animals. To\nillustrate: When I was a farm boy out in Missouri, my father bred fine\nDuroc-Jersey hogs and pedigreed white-faced cattle. We used to\nexhibit our hogs and white-faced cattle at the country fairs and\nlivestock shows throughout the Middle West. We won first prizes by\nthe score. My father pinned his blue ribbons on a sheet of white\nmuslin, and when friends or visitors came to the house, he would get\nout the long sheet of muslin. He would hold one end and I would\nhold the other while he exhibited the blue ribbons.\nThe hogs didn\u2019t care about the ribbons they had won. But Father\ndid. These prizes gave him a feeling of importance.\nIf our ancestors hadn\u2019t had this flaming urge for a feeling of\nimportance, civilization would have been impossible. Without it, we\nshould have been just about like animals.\nIt was this desire for a feeling of importance that led an\nuneducated, poverty-stricken grocery clerk to study some law books\nhe found in the bottom of a barrel of household plunder that he had\nbought for fifty cents. You have probably heard of this grocery clerk.\nHis name was Lincoln.\nIt was this desire for a feeling of importance that inspired Dickens\nto write his immortal novels. This desire inspired Sir Christopher\nWren to design his symphonies in stone. This desire made\nRockefeller amass millions that he never spent! And this same\ndesire made the richest family in your town build a house far too\nlarge for its requirements.\nThis desire makes you want to wear the latest styles, drive the\nlatest cars, and talk about your brilliant children.\nIt is this desire that lures many boys and girls into joining gangs\nand engaging in criminal activities. The average young criminal,\naccording to E. P. Mulrooney, onetime police commissioner of New\nYork, is filled with ego, and his first request after arrest is for those\nlurid newspapers that make him out a hero. The disagreeable\nprospect of serving time seems remote so long as he can gloat over\nhis likeness sharing space with pictures of sports figures, movie and\nTV stars and politicians.\nIf you tell me how you get your feeling of importance, I\u2019ll tell you\nwhat you are. That determines your character. That is the most\nsignificant thing about you. For example, John D. Rockefeller got his\nfeeling of importance by giving money to erect a modern hospital in\nPeking, China, to care for millions of poor people whom he had\nnever seen and never would see. Dillinger, on the other hand, got his\nfeeling of importance by being a bandit, a bank robber and killer.\nWhen the FBI agents were hunting him, he dashed into a farmhouse\nup in Minnesota and said, \u201cI\u2019m Dillinger!\u201d He was proud of the fact\nthat he was Public Enemy Number One. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you,\nbut I\u2019m Dillinger!\u201d he said.\nYes, the one significant difference between Dillinger and\nRockefeller is how they got their feeling of importance.\nHistory sparkles with amusing examples of famous people\nstruggling for a feeling of importance. Even George Washington\nwanted to be called \u201cHis Mightiness, the President of the United\nStates\u201d; and Columbus pleaded for the title \u201cAdmiral of the Ocean\nand Viceroy of India.\u201d Catherine the Great refused to open letters\nthat were not addressed to \u201cHer Imperial Majesty\u201d; and Mrs. Lincoln,\nin the White House, turned upon Mrs. Grant like a tigress and\nshouted, \u201cHow dare you be seated in my presence until I invite you!\u201d\nOur millionaires helped finance Admiral Byrd\u2019s expedition to the\nAntarctic in 1928 with the understanding that ranges of icy\nmountains would be named after them; and Victor Hugo aspired to\nhave nothing less than the city of Paris renamed in his honor. Even\nShakespeare, mightiest of the mighty, tried to add luster to his name\nby procuring a coat of arms for his family.\nPeople sometimes became invalids in order to win sympathy and\nattention, and get a feeling of importance. For example, take Mrs.\nMcKinley. She got a feeling of importance by forcing her husband,\nthe President of the United States, to neglect important affairs of\nstate while he reclined on the bed beside her for hours at a time, his\narm about her, soothing her to sleep. She fed her gnawing desire for\nattention by insisting that he remain with her while she was having\nher teeth fixed, and once created a stormy scene when he had to\nleave her alone with the dentist while he kept an appointment with\nJohn Hay, his secretary of state.\nThe writer Mary Roberts Rinehart once told me of a bright,\nvigorous young woman who became an invalid in order to get a\nfeeling of importance. \u201cOne day,\u201d said Mrs. Rinehart, \u201cthis woman\nhad been obliged to face something, her age perhaps. The lonely\nyears were stretching ahead and there was little left for her to\nanticipate.\n\u201cShe took to her bed; and for ten years her old mother traveled to\nthe third floor and back, carrying trays, nursing her. Then one day\nthe old mother, weary with service, lay down and died. For some\nweeks, the invalid languished; then she got up, put on her clothing,\nand resumed living again.\u201d\nSome authorities declare that people may actually go insane in\norder to find, in the dreamland of insanity, the feeling of importance\nthat has been denied them in the harsh world of reality. There are\nmore patients suffering from mental diseases in the United States\nthan from all other diseases combined.\nWhat is the cause of insanity?\nNobody can answer such a sweeping question, but we know that\ncertain diseases, such as syphilis, break down and destroy the brain\ncells and result in insanity. In fact, about one-half of all mental\ndiseases can be attributed to such physical causes as brain lesions,\nalcohol, toxins and injuries. But the other half\u2014and this is the\nappalling part of the story\u2014the other half of the people who go\ninsane apparently have nothing organically wrong with their brain\ncells. In post-mortem examinations, when their brain tissues are\nstudied under the highest-powered microscopes, these tissues are\nfound to be apparently just as healthy as yours and mine.\nWhy do these people go insane?\nI put that question to the head physician of one of our most\nimportant psychiatric hospitals. This doctor, who has received the\nhighest honors and the most coveted awards for his knowledge of\nthis subject, told me frankly that he didn\u2019t know why people went\ninsane. Nobody knows for sure. But he did say that many people\nwho go insane find in insanity a feeling of importance that they were\nunable to achieve in the world of reality. Then he told me this story:\n\u201cI have a patient right now whose marriage proved to be a tragedy.\nShe wanted love, sexual gratification, children and social prestige,\nbut life blasted all her hopes. Her husband didn\u2019t love her. He\nrefused even to eat with her and forced her to serve his meals in his\nroom upstairs. She had no children, no social standing. She went\ninsane; and, in her imagination, she divorced her husband and\nresumed her maiden name. She now believes she has married into\nEnglish aristocracy, and she insists on being called Lady Smith.\n\u201cAnd as for children, she imagines now that she has had a new\nchild every night. Each time I call on her she says: \u2018Doctor, I had a\nbaby last night.\u2019\u201d\nLife once wrecked all her dream ships on the sharp rocks of reality;\nbut in the sunny, fantasy isles of insanity, all her barkentines race\ninto port with canvas billowing and winds singing through the masts.\nTragic? Oh, I don\u2019t know. Her physician said to me: \u201cIf I could\nstretch out my hand and restore her sanity, I wouldn\u2019t do it. She\u2019s\nmuch happier as she is.\u201d\nIf some people are so hungry for a feeling of importance that they\nactually go insane to get it, imagine what miracle you and I can\nachieve by giving people honest appreciation this side of insanity.\nOne of the first people in American business to be paid a salary of\nover a million dollars a year (when there was no income tax and a\nperson earning fifty dollars a week was considered well off) was\nCharles Schwab. He had been picked by Andrew Carnegie to\nbecome the first president of the newly formed United States Steel\nCompany in 1921, when Schwab was only thirty-eight years old.\n(Schwab later left U.S. Steel to take over the then troubled\nBethlehem Steel Company, and he rebuilt it into one of the most\nprofitable companies in America.)\nWhy did Andrew Carnegie pay a million dollars a year, or more\nthan three thousand dollars a day, to Charles Schwab? Why?\nBecause Schwab was a genius? No. Because he knew more about\nthe manufacture of steel than other people? Nonsense. Charles\nSchwab told me himself that he had many men working for him who\nknew more about the manufacture of steel than he did.\nSchwab says that he was paid this salary largely because of his\nability to deal with people. I asked him how he did it. Here is his\nsecret set down in his own words\u2014words that ought to be cast in\neternal bronze and hung in every home and school, every shop and\noffice in the land\u2014words that children ought to memorize instead of\nwasting their time memorizing the conjugation of Latin verbs or the\namount of the annual rainfall in Brazil\u2014words that will all but\ntransform your life and mine if we will only live them:\n\u201cI consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people,\u201d\nsaid Schwab, \u201cthe greatest asset I possess, and the way to develop\nthe best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement.\n\u201cThere is nothing else that so kills the ambitions of a person as\ncriticisms from superiors. I never criticize anyone. I believe in giving\na person incentive to work. So I am anxious to praise but loath to\nfind fault. If I like anything, I am hearty in my approbation and lavish\nin my praise.\u201d\nThat is what Schwab did. But what do average people do? The\nexact opposite. If they don\u2019t like a thing, they bawl out their\nsubordinates; if they do like it, they say nothing. As the old couplet\nsays: \u201cOnce I did bad and that I heard ever/Twice I did good, but that\nI heard never.\u201d\n\u201cIn my wide association in life, meeting with many and great people\nin various parts of the world,\u201d Schwab declared, \u201cI have yet to find\nthe person, however great or exalted his station, who did not do\nbetter work and put forth greater effort under a spirit of approval than\nhe would ever do under a spirit of criticism.\u201d\nThat he said, frankly, was one of the outstanding reasons for the\nphenomenal success of Andrew Carnegie. Carnegie praised his\nassociates publicly as well as privately.\nCarnegie wanted to praise his assistants even on his tombstone.\nHe wrote an epitaph for himself which read: \u201cHere lies one who knew\nhow to get around him men who were cleverer than himself.\u201d\nSincere appreciation was one of the secrets of the first John D.\nRockefeller\u2019s success in handling men. For example, when one of\nhis partners, Edward T. Bedford, lost a million dollars for the firm by a\nbad buy in South America, John D. might have criticized; but he\nknew Bedford had done his best\u2014and the incident was closed. So\nRockefeller found something to praise; he congratulated Bedford\nbecause he had been able to save 60 percent of the money he had\ninvested. \u201cThat\u2019s splendid,\u201d said Rockefeller. \u201cWe don\u2019t always do as\nwell as that upstairs.\u201d\nI have among my clippings a story that I know never happened, but\nit illustrates a truth, so I\u2019ll repeat it:\nAccording to this silly story, a farm woman, at the end of a heavy\nday\u2019s work, set before her menfolks a heaping pile of hay. And when\nthey indignantly demanded whether she had gone crazy, she replied:\n\u201cWhy, how did I know you\u2019d notice? I\u2019ve been cooking for you men\nfor the last twenty years and in all that time I ain\u2019t heard no word to\nlet me know you wasn\u2019t just eating hay.\u201d\nWhen a study was made a few years ago on runaway wives, what\ndo you think was discovered to be the main reason wives ran away?\nIt was \u201clack of appreciation.\u201d And I\u2019d bet that a similar study made of\nrunaway husbands would come out the same way. We often take our\nspouses so much for granted that we never let them know we\nappreciate them.\nA member of one of our classes told of a request made by his wife.\nShe and a group of other women in her church were involved in a\nself-improvement program. She asked her husband to help her by\nlisting six things he believed she could do to help her become a\nbetter wife. He reported to the class: \u201cI was surprised by such a\nrequest. Frankly, it would have been easy for me to list six things I\nwould like to change about her\u2014my heavens, she could have listed\na thousand things she would like to change about me\u2014but I didn\u2019t. I\nsaid to her, \u2018Let me think about it and give you an answer in the\nmorning.\u2019\n\u201cThe next morning I got up very early and called the florist and had\nthem send six red roses to my wife with a note saying: \u2018I can\u2019t think\nof six things I would like to change about you. I love you the way you\nare.\u2019\n\u201cWhen I arrived at home that evening, who do you think greeted\nme at the door? That\u2019s right. My wife! She was almost in tears.\nNeedless to say, I was extremely glad I had not criticized her as she\nhad requested.\n\u201cThe following Sunday at church, after she had reported the results\nof her assignment, several women with whom she had been\nstudying came up to me and said, \u2018That was the most considerate\nthing I have ever heard.\u2019 It was then I realized the power of\nappreciation.\u201d\nFlorenz Ziegfeld, the most spectacular producer who ever dazzled\nBroadway, gained his reputation by his subtle ability to \u201cglorify the\nAmerican girl.\u201d Time after time, he took drab little creatures that no\none ever looked at twice and transformed them on the stage into\nglamorous visions of mystery and seduction. Knowing the value of\nappreciation and confidence, he made women feel beautiful by the\nsheer power of his gallantry and consideration. He was practical: he\nraised the salary of chorus girls from thirty dollars a week to as high\nas one hundred and seventy-five. And he was also chivalrous; on\nopening night at the Follies, he sent telegrams to the stars in the\ncast, and he deluged every chorus girl in the show with American\nBeauty roses.\nI once succumbed to the fad of fasting and went for six days and\nnights without eating. It wasn\u2019t difficult. I was less hungry at the end\nof the sixth day than I was at the end of the second. Yet I know, as\nyou know, people who would think they had committed a crime if\nthey let their families or employees go for six days without food; but\nthey will let them go for six days, and six weeks, and sometimes\nsixty years without giving them the hearty appreciation that they\ncrave almost as much as they crave food.\nWhen Alfred Lunt, one of the great actors of his time, played the\nleading role in Reunion in Vienna, he said, \u201cThere is nothing I need\nso much as nourishment for my self-esteem.\u201d\nWe nourish the bodies of our children and friends and employees,\nbut how seldom do we nourish their self-esteem? We provide them\nwith roast beef and potatoes to build energy, but we neglect to give\nthem kind words of appreciation that would sing in their memories for\nyears like the music of the morning stars.\nPaul Harvey, in one of his radio broadcasts, \u201cThe Rest of the\nStory,\u201d told how showing sincere appreciation can change a person\u2019s\nlife. He reported that years ago a teacher in Detroit asked Stevie\nMorris to help her find a mouse that was lost in the classroom. You\nsee, she appreciated the fact that nature had given Stevie something\nno one else in the room had. Nature had given Stevie a remarkable\npair of ears to compensate for his blind eyes. But this was really the\nfirst time Stevie had been shown appreciation for those talented\nears. Now, years later, he says that this act of appreciation was the\nbeginning of a new life. You see, from that time on he developed his\ngift of hearing and went on to become, under the stage name of\nStevie Wonder, one of the great pop singers and songwriters of the\nseventies.*\nSome readers are saying right now as they read these lines: \u201cOh,\nphooey! Flattery! Bear oil! I\u2019ve tried that stuff. It doesn\u2019t work\u2014not\nwith intelligent people.\u201d\nOf course flattery seldom works with discerning people. It is\nshallow, selfish and insincere. It ought to fail and it usually does.\nTrue, some people are so hungry, so thirsty, for appreciation that\nthey will swallow anything, just as a starving man will eat grass and\nfishworms.\nEven Queen Victoria was susceptible to flattery. Prime Minister\nBenjamin Disraeli confessed that he put it on thick in dealing with the\nQueen. To use his exact words, he said he \u201cspread it on with a\ntrowel.\u201d But Disraeli was one of the most polished, deft and adroit\nmen who ever ruled the far-flung British Empire. He was a genius in\nhis line. What would work for him wouldn\u2019t necessarily work for you\nand me. In the long run, flattery will do you more harm than good.\nFlattery is counterfeit, and like counterfeit money, it will eventually\nget you into trouble if you pass it to someone else.\nThe difference between appreciation and flattery? That is simple.\nOne is sincere and the other insincere. One comes from the heart\nout; the other from the teeth out. One is unselfish; the other selfish.\nOne is universally admired; the other universally condemned.\nI recently saw a bust of Mexican hero General Alvaro Obregon in\nthe Chapultepec palace in Mexico City. Below the bust are carved\nthese wise words from General Obregon\u2019s philosophy: \u201cDon\u2019t be\nafraid of enemies who attack you. Be afraid of the friends who flatter\nyou.\u201d\nNo! No! No! I am not suggesting flattery! Far from it. I\u2019m talking\nabout a new way of life. Let me repeat. I am talking about a new way\nof life.\nKing George V had a set of six maxims displayed on the walls of\nhis study at Buckingham Palace. One of these maxims said: \u201cTeach\nme neither to proffer nor receive cheap praise.\u201d That\u2019s all flattery is\u2014\ncheap praise. I once read a definition of flattery that may be worth\nrepeating: \u201cFlattery is telling the other person precisely what he\nthinks about himself.\u201d\n\u201cUse what language you will,\u201d said Ralph Waldo Emerson, \u201cyou\ncan never say anything but what you are.\u201d\nIf all we had to do was flatter, everybody would catch on and we\nshould all be experts in human relations.\nWhen we are not engaged in thinking about some definite problem,\nwe usually spend about 95 percent of our time thinking about\nourselves. Now, if we stop thinking about ourselves for a while and\nbegin to think of the other person\u2019s good points, we won\u2019t have to\nresort to flattery so cheap and false that it can be spotted almost\nbefore it is out of the mouth.\nOne of the most neglected virtues of our daily existence is\nappreciation. Somehow, we neglect to praise our son or daughter\nwhen he or she brings home a good report card, and we fail to\nencourage our children when they first succeed in baking a cake or\nbuilding a birdhouse. Nothing pleases children more than this kind of\nparental interest and approval.\nThe next time you enjoy filet mignon at the club, send word to the\nchef that it was excellently prepared, and when a tired salesperson\nshows you unusual courtesy, please mention it.\nEvery minister, lecturer and public speaker knows the\ndiscouragement of pouring himself or herself out to an audience and\nnot receiving a single ripple of appreciative comment. What applies\nto professionals applies doubly to workers in offices, shops and\nfactories and our families and friends. In our interpersonal relations\nwe should never forget that all our associates are human beings and\nhunger for appreciation. It is the legal tender that all souls enjoy.\nTry leaving a friendly trail of little sparks of gratitude on your daily\ntrips. You will be surprised how they will set small flames of\nfriendship that will be rose beacons on your next visit.\nPamela Dunham of New Fairfield, Connecticut, had among her\nresponsibilities on her job the supervision of a janitor who was doing\na very poor job. The other employees would jeer at him and litter the\nhallways to show him what a bad job he was doing. It was so bad,\nproductive time was being lost in the shop.\nWithout success, Pam tried various ways to motivate this person.\nShe noticed that occasionally he did a particularly good piece of\nwork. She made a point to praise him for it in front of the other\npeople. Each day the job he did all around got better, and pretty\nsoon he started doing all his work efficiently. Now he does an\nexcellent job and other people give him appreciation and recognition.\nHonest appreciation got results where criticism and ridicule failed.\nHurting people not only does not change them, it is never called\nfor. There is an old saying that I have cut out and pasted on my\nmirror where I cannot help but see it every day:\nI shall pass this way but once; any good, therefore, that I can\ndo or any kindness that I can show to any human being, let me\ndo it now. Let me not defer nor neglect it, for I shall not pass this\nway again.\nEmerson said: \u201cEvery man I meet is my superior in some way. In\nthat, I learn of him.\u201d\nIf that was true of Emerson, isn\u2019t it likely to be a thousand times\nmore true of you and me? Let\u2019s cease thinking of our\naccomplishments, our wants. Let\u2019s try to figure out the other person\u2019s\ngood points. Then forget flattery. Give honest, sincere appreciation.\nBe \u201chearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise,\u201d and people\nwill cherish your words and treasure them and repeat them over a\nlifetime\u2014repeat them years after you have forgotten them.\nPRINCIPLE 2\nGive honest and sincere appreciation.")),(0,o.kt)("ul",null,(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},"Paul Aurandt, Paul Harvey\u2019s The Rest of the Story (New York:\nDoubleday, 1977).

Personally I am\nvery fond of strawberries and cream, but I have found that for some\nstrange reason, fish prefer worms. So when I went fishing, I didn\u2019t\nthink about what I wanted. I thought about what they wanted. I didn\u2019t\nbait the hook with strawberries and cream.

When someone asked him how he managed to\nstay in power after the other wartime leaders\u2014Wilson, Orlando and\nClemenceau\u2014had been forgotten, he replied that if his staying on\ntop might be attributed to any one thing, it would be to his having\nlearned that it was necessary to bait the hook to suit the fish.\nWhy talk about what we want? That is childish. Absured. Of\ncourse, you are interested in what you want. You are eternally\ninterested in it. But no one else is. The rest of us are just like you: we\nare interested in what we want.\nSo the only way on earth to influence other people is to talk about\nwhat they want and show them how to get it.\nRemember that tomorrow when you are trying to get somebody to\ndo something. If, for example, you don\u2019t want your children to smoke,\ndon\u2019t preach at them, and don\u2019t talk about what you want; but show\nthem that cigarettes may keep them from making the basketball\nteam or winning the hundred-yard dash.\nThis is a good thing to remember regardless of whether you are\ndealing with children or calves or chimpanzees. For example: one\nday Ralph Waldo Emerson and his son tried to get a calf into the\nbarn. But they made the common mistake of thinking only of what\nthey wanted: Emerson pushed and his son pulled. But the calf was\ndoing just what they were doing; he was thinking only of what he\nwanted; so he stiffened his legs and stubbornly refused to leave the\npasture. The Irish housemaid saw their predicament. She couldn\u2019t\nwrite essays and books; but, on this occasion at least, she had more\nhorse sense, or calf sense, than Emerson had. She thought of what\nthe calf wanted; so she put her maternal finger in the calf\u2019s mouth\nand let the calf suck her finger as she gently led him into the barn.\nEvery act you have ever performed since the day you were born\nwas performed because you wanted something. How about the time\nyou gave a large contribution to the Red Cross? Yes, that is no\nexception to the rule. You gave the Red Cross the donation because\nyou wanted to lend a helping hand; you wanted to do a beautiful,\nunselfish, divine act. \u201cInasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the\nleast of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.\u201d\nIf you hadn\u2019t wanted that feeling more than you wanted your\nmoney, you would not have made the contribution. Of course, you\nmight have made the contribution because you were ashamed to\nrefuse or because a customer asked you to do it. But one thing is\ncertain. You made the contribution because you wanted something.\nHarry A. Overstreet in his illuminating book Influencing Human\nBehavior said: \u201cAction springs out of what we fundamentally desire .\n. . and the best piece of advice which can be given to would-be\npersuaders, whether in business, in the home, in the school, in\npolitics, is: First, arouse in the other person an eager want. He who\ncan do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a\nlonely way.\u201d\nAndrew Carnegie, the poverty-stricken Scotch lad who started to\nwork at two cents an hour and finally gave away $365 million,\nlearned early in life that the only way to influence people is to talk in\nterms of what the other person wants. He attended school only four\nyears; yet he learned how to handle people.\nTo illustrate: His sister-in-law was worried sick over her two boys.\nThey were at Yale, and they were so busy with their own affairs that\nthey neglected to write home and paid no attention whatever to their\nmother\u2019s frantic letters.\nThen Carnegie offered to wager a hundred dollars that he could\nget an answer by return mail, without even asking for it. Someone\ncalled his bet; so he wrote his nephews a chatty letter, mentioning\ncasually in a postscript that he was sending each one a five-dollar\nbill.\nHe neglected, however, to enclose the money.\nBack came replies by return mail thanking \u201cDear Uncle Andrew\u201d for\nhis kind note and\u2014you can finish the sentence yourself.\nAnother example of persuading comes from Stan Novak of\nCleveland, Ohio, a participant in our course. Stan came home from\nwork one evening to find his youngest son, Tim, kicking and\nscreaming on the living room floor. He was to start kindergarten the\nnext day and was protesting that he would not go. Stan\u2019s normal\nreaction would have been to banish the child to his room and tell him\nhe\u2019d just better make up his mind to go. He had no choice. But\ntonight, recognizing that this would not really help Tim start\nkindergarten in the best frame of mind, Stan sat down and thought,\n\u201cIf I were Tim, why would I be excited about going to kindergarten?\u201d\nHe and his wife made a list of all the fun things Tim would do such as\nfinger painting, singing songs, making new friends. Then they put\nthem into action. \u201cWe all started finger-painting on the kitchen table\n\u2014my wife, Lil, my other son Bob, and myself, all having fun. Soon\nTim was peeping around the corner. Next he was begging to\nparticipate. \u2018Oh, no! You have to go to kindergarten first to learn how\nto finger-paint.\u2019 With all the enthusiasm I could muster I went through\nthe list talking in terms he could understand\u2014telling him all the fun\nhe would have in kindergarten. The next morning, I thought I was the\nfirst one up. I went downstairs and found Tim sitting sound asleep in\nthe living room chair. \u2018What are you doing here?\u2019 I asked. \u2018I\u2019m waiting\nto go to kindergarten. I don\u2019t want to be late.\u2019 The enthusiasm of our\nentire family had aroused in Tim an eager want that no amount of\ndiscussion or threat could have possibly accomplished.\u201d\nTomorrow you may want to persuade somebody to do something.\nBefore you speak, pause and ask yourself: \u201cHow can I make this\nperson want to do it?\u201d\nThat question will stop us from rushing into a situation heedlessly,\nwith futile chatter about our desires.\nAt one time I rented the grand ballroom of a certain New York hotel\nfor twenty nights in each season in order to hold a series of lectures.\nAt the beginning of one season, I was suddenly informed that I\nshould have to pay almost three times as much rent as formerly. This\nnews reached me after the tickets had been printed and distributed\nand all announcements had been made.\nNaturally, I didn\u2019t want to pay the increase, but what was the use of\ntalking to the hotel about what I wanted? They were interested only\nin what they wanted. So a couple of days later I went to see the\nmanager.\n\u201cI was a bit shocked when I got your letter,\u201d I said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t\nblame you at all. If I had been in your position, I should probably\nhave written a similar letter myself. Your duty as the manager of the\nhotel is to make all the profit possible. If you don\u2019t do that, you will be\nfired and you ought to be fired. Now, let\u2019s take a piece of paper and\nwrite down the advantages and the disadvantages that will accrue to\nyou, if you insist on this increase in rent.\u201d\nThen I took a letterhead and ran a line through the center and\nheaded one column \u201cAdvantages\u201d and the other column\n\u201cDisadvantages.\u201d\nI wrote down under the head \u201cAdvantages\u201d these words: \u201cBallroom\nfree.\u201d Then I went on to say: \u201cYou will have the advantage of having\nthe ballroom free to rent for dances and conventions. That is a big\nadvantage, for affairs like that will pay you much more than you can\nget for a series of lectures. If I tie your ballroom up for twenty nights\nduring the course of the season, it is sure to mean a loss of some\nvery profitable business to you.\n\u201cNow, let\u2019s consider the disadvantages. First, instead of increasing\nyour income from me, you are going to decrease it. In fact, you are\ngoing to wipe it out because I cannot pay the rent you are asking. I\nshall be forced to hold these lectures at some other place.\n\u201cThere\u2019s another disadvantage to you also. These lectures attract\ncrowds of educated and cultured people to your hotel. That is good\nadvertising for you, isn\u2019t it? In fact, if you spent five thousand dollars\nadvertising in the newspapers, you couldn\u2019t bring as many people to\nlook at your hotel as I can bring by these lectures. That is worth a lot\nto a hotel, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nAs I talked, I wrote these two \u201cdisadvantages\u201d under the proper\nheading, and handed the sheet of paper to the manager, saying: \u201cI\nwish you would carefully consider both the advantages and\ndisadvantages that are going to accrue to you and then give me your\nfinal decision.\u201d\nI received a letter the next day, informing me that my rent would be\nincreased only 50 percent instead of 300 percent.\nMind you, I got this reduction without saying a word about what I\nwanted. I talked all the time about what the other person wanted and\nhow he could get it.\nSuppose I had done the human, natural thing; suppose I had\nstormed into his office and said, \u201cWhat do you mean by raising my\nrent three hundred percent when you know the tickets have been\nprinted and the announcements made? Three hundred percent!\nRidiculous! Absurd! I won\u2019t pay it!\u201d\nWhat would have happened then? An argument would have begun\nto steam and boil and sputter\u2014and you know how arguments end.\nEven if I had convinced him that he was wrong, his pride would have\nmade it difficult for him to back down and give in.\nHere is one of the best bits of advice ever given about the fine art\nof human relationships. \u201cIf there is any one secret of success,\u201d said\nHenry Ford, \u201cit lies in the ability to get the other person\u2019s point of\nview and see things from that person\u2019s angle as well as from your\nown.\u201d\nThat is so good, I want to repeat it: \u201cIf there is any one secret of\nsuccess, it lies in the ability to get the other person\u2019s point of view\nand see things from that person\u2019s angle as well as from your own.\u201d\nThat is so simple, so obvious, that anyone ought to see the truth of\nit at a glance; yet 90 percent of the people on this earth ignore it 90\npercent of the time.\nAn example? Look at the letters that come across your desk\ntomorrow morning, and you will find that most of them violate this\nimportant canon of common sense. Take this one, a letter written by\nthe head of the radio department of an advertising agency with\noffices scattered across the continent. This letter was sent to the\nmanagers of local radio stations throughout the country. (I have set\ndown, in brackets, my reactions to each paragraph.)\nMr. John Blank,\nBlankville, Indiana\nDear Mr. Blank:\nThe\u2014\u2014\u2014company desires to retain its position in advertising\nagency leadership in the radio field.\n","[Who cares what your company desires? I am worried about my\nown problems. The bank is foreclosing the mortgage on my house,\nthe bugs are destroying the hollyhocks, the stock market tumbled\nyesterday.

I come\ndown to the office this morning worried, open my mail and here is\nsome little whippersnapper off in New York yapping about what his\ncompany wants. Bah! If he only realized what sort of impression his\nletter makes, he would get out of the advertising business and start\nmanufacturing sheep dip.]","\nThis agency\u2019s national advertising accounts were the bulwark\nof the network.

I\ndon\u2019t give two whoops in Hades if you are as big as General Motors\nand General Electric and the General Staff of the U.S. Army all\ncombined. If you had as much sense as a half-witted hummingbird,\nyou would realize that I am interested in how big I am\u2014not how big\nyou are.

What\neffect did this letter have on the man to whom it was addressed?\nRead it and then I\u2019ll tell you.\nA. Zerega\u2019s Sons, Inc.\n28 Front St.\nBrooklyn, N.Y. 11201\nAttention: Mr. Edward Vermylen\nGentlemen:\nThe operations at our outbound-rail-receiving station are\nhandicapped because a material percentage of the total\nbusiness is delivered us in the late afternoon. This condition\nresults in congestion, overtime on the part of our forces, delays\nto trucks, and in some cases delays to freight. On November 10,\nwe received from your company a lot of 510 pieces, which\nreached here at 4:20 p.m.\nWe solicit your cooperation toward overcoming the undesirable\neffects arising from late receipt of freight. May we ask that, on\ndays on which you ship the volume which was received on the\nabove date, effort be made either to get the truck here earlier or\nto deliver us part of the freight during the morning?\nThe advantage that would accrue to you under such an\narrangement would be that of more expeditious discharge of\nyour trucks and the assurance that your business would go\nforward on the date of its receipt.\nVery truly yours,\nJ\u2014\u2014 B\u2014\u2014, Supt.\nAfter reading this letter, Mr. Vermylen, sales manager for A.\nZerega\u2019s Sons, Inc., sent it to me with the following comment:\nThis letter had the reverse effect from that which was intended.\nThe letter begins by describing the Terminal\u2019s difficulties, in\nwhich we are not interested, generally speaking. Our\ncooperation is then requested without any thought as to whether\nit would inconvenience us, and then, finally, in the last\nparagraph, the fact is mentioned that if we do cooperate it will\nmean more expeditious discharge of our trucks with the\nassurance that our freight will go forward on the date of its\nreceipt.\nIn other words, that in which we are most interested is\nmentioned last and the whole effect is one of raising a spirit of\nantagonism rather than of cooperation.\nLet\u2019s see if we can\u2019t rewrite and improve this letter. Let\u2019s not waste\nany time talking about our problems. As Henry Ford admonishes,\nlet\u2019s \u201cget the other person\u2019s point of view and see things from his or\nher angle, as well as from our own.\u201d\nHere is one way of revising the letter. It may not be the best way,\nbut isn\u2019t it an improvement?\nMr. Edward Vermylen\nc/o A. Zerega\u2019s Sons, Inc.\n28 Front St.\nBrooklyn, N.Y. 11201\nDear Mr. Vermylen:\nYour company has been one of our good customers for\nfourteen years. Naturally, we are very grateful for your patronage\nand are eager to give you the speedy, efficient service you\ndeserve. However, we regret to say that it isn\u2019t possible for us to\ndo that when your trucks bring us a large shipment late in the\nafternoon, as they did on November 10. Why? Because many\nother customers make late afternoon deliveries also. Naturally,\nthat causes congestion. That means your trucks are held up\nunavoidably at the pier and sometimes even your freight is\ndelayed.\nThat\u2019s bad, but it can be avoided. If you make your deliveries\nat the pier in the morning when possible, your trucks will be able\nto keep moving, your freight will get immediate attention, and our\nworkers will get home early at night to enjoy a dinner of the\ndelicious macaroni and noodles that you manufacture.\nRegardless of when your shipments arrive, we shall always\ncheerfully do all in our power to serve you promptly.\nYou are busy. Please don\u2019t trouble to answer this note.\nYours truly,\nJ\u2014\u2014 B\u2014\u2014, Supt.\nBarbara Anderson, who worked in a bank in New York, desired to\nmove to Phoenix, Arizona, because of the health of her son. Using\nthe principles she had learned in our course, she wrote the following\nletter to twelve banks in Phoenix:\nDear Sir:\nMy ten years of bank experience should be of interest to a\nrapidly growing bank like yours.\nIn various capacities in bank operations with the Bankers Trust\nCompany in New York, leading to my present assignment as\nBranch Manager, I have acquired skills in all phases of banking\nincluding depositor relations, credits, loans and administration.\nI will be relocating to Phoenix in May and I am sure I can\ncontribute to your growth and profit. I will be in Phoenix the week\nof April 3 and would appreciate the opportunity to show you how\nI can help your bank meet its goals.\nSincerely,\nBarbara L. Anderson\nDo you think Mrs. Anderson received any response from that\nletter? Eleven of the twelve banks invited her to be interviewed, and\nshe had a choice of which bank\u2019s offer to accept. Why? Mrs.\nAnderson did not state what she wanted, but wrote in the letter how\nshe could help them, and focused on their wants, not her own.\nThousands of salespeople are pounding the pavements today,\ntired, discouraged and underpaid. Why? Because they are always\nthinking only of what they want. They don\u2019t realize that neither you\nnor I want to buy anything. If we did, we would go out and buy it. But\nboth of us are eternally interested in solving our problems. And if\nsalespeople can show us how their services or merchandise will help\nus solve our problems, they won\u2019t need to sell us. We\u2019ll buy. And\ncustomers like to feel that they are buying\u2014not being sold.\nYet many salespeople spend a lifetime in selling without seeing\nthings from the customer\u2019s angle. For example, for many years I\nlived in Forest Hills, a little community of private homes in the center\nof Greater New York. One day as I was rushing to the station, I\nchanced to meet a real-estate operator who had bought and sold\nproperty in that area for many years. He knew Forest Hills well, so I\nhurriedly asked him whether or not my stucco house was built with\nmetal lath or hollow tile. He said he didn\u2019t know and told me what I\nalready knew\u2014that I could find out by calling the Forest Hills Garden\nAssociation. The following morning, I received a letter from him. Did\nhe give me the information I wanted? He could have gotten it in sixty\nseconds by a telephone call. But he didn\u2019t. He told me again that I\ncould get it by telephoning, and then asked me to let him handle my\ninsurance.\nHe was not interested in helping me. He was interested only in\nhelping himself.\nJ. Howard Lucas of Birmingham, Alabama, tells how two\nsalespeople from the same company handled the same type of\nsituation. He reported:\n\u201cSeveral years ago I was on the management team of a small\ncompany. Headquartered near us was the district office of a large\ninsurance company. Their agents were assigned territories, and our\ncompany was assigned to two agents, whom I shall refer to as Carl\nand John.\n\u201cOne morning, Carl dropped by our office and casually mentioned\nthat his company had just introduced a new life insurance policy for\nexecutives and thought we might be interested later on and he would\nget back to us when he had more information on it.\n\u201cThe same day, John saw us on the sidewalk while returning from\na coffee break, and he shouted: \u2018Hey Luke, hold up, I have some\ngreat news for you fellows.\u2019 He hurried over and very excitedly told\nus about an executive life insurance policy his company had\nintroduced that very day. (It was the same policy that Carl had\ncasually mentioned.) He wanted us to have one of the first issued.\nHe gave us a few important facts about the coverage and ended\nsaying, \u2018The policy is so new, I\u2019m going to have someone from the\nhome office come out tomorrow and explain it. Now, in the\nmeantime, let\u2019s get the applications signed and on the way so he can\nhave more information to work with.\u2019 His enthusiasm aroused in us\nan eager want for this policy even though we still did not have\ndetails. When they were made available to us, they confirmed John\u2019s\ninitial understanding of the policy, and he not only sold each of us a\npolicy, but later doubled our coverage.\n\u201cCarl could have had those sales, but he made no effort to arouse\nin us any desire for the policies.\u201d\nThe world is full of people who are grabbing and self-seeking. So\nthe rare individual who unselfishly tries to serve others has an\nenormous advantage. He has little competition. Owen D. Young, a\nnoted lawyer and one of America\u2019s great business leaders, once\nsaid: \u201cPeople who can put themselves in the place of other people,\nwho can understand the workings of their minds, need never worry\nabout what the future has in store for them.\u201d\nIf out of reading this book you get just one thing\u2014an increased\ntendency to think always in terms of other people\u2019s point of view, and\nsee things from their angle\u2014if you get that one thing out of this book,\nit may easily prove to be one of the building blocks of your career.\nLooking at the other person\u2019s point of view and arousing in him an\neager want for something is not to be construed as manipulating that\nperson so that he will do something that is only for your benefit and\nhis detriment. Each party should gain from the negotiation. In the\nletters to Mr. Vermylen, both the sender and the receiver of the\ncorrespondence gained by implementing what was suggested. Both\nthe bank and Mrs. Anderson won by her letter in that the bank\nobtained a valuable employee and Mrs. Anderson a suitable job. And\nin the example of John\u2019s sale of insurance to Mr. Lucas, both gained\nthrough this transaction.\nAnother example in which everybody gains through this principle of\narousing an eager want comes from Michael E. Whidden of Warwick,\nRhode Island, who is a territory salesman for the Shell Oil Company.\nMike wanted to become the Number One salesperson in his district,\nbut one service station was holding him back. It was run by an older\nman who could not be motivated to clean up his station. It was in\nsuch poor shape that sales were declining significantly.\nThis manager would not listen to any of Mike\u2019s pleas to upgrade\nthe station. After many exhortations and heart-to-heart talks\u2014all of\nwhich had no impact\u2014Mike decided to invite the manager to visit the\nnewest Shell station in his territory.\nThe manager was so impressed by the facilities at the new station\nthat when Mike visited him the next time, his station was cleaned up\nand had recorded a sales increase. This enabled Mike to reach the\nNumber One spot in his district. All his talking and discussion hadn\u2019t\nhelped, but by arousing an eager want in the manager, by showing\nhim the modern station, he had accomplished his goal, and both the\nmanager and Mike benefited.\nMost people go through college and learn to read Virgil and master\nthe mysteries of calculus without ever discovering how their own\nminds function. For instance: I once gave a course in Effective\nSpeaking for the young college graduates who were entering the\nemploy of the Carrier Corporation, the large air-conditioner\nmanufacturer. One of the participants wanted to persuade the others\nto play basketball in their free time, and this is about what he said: \u201cI\nwant you to come out and play basketball. I like to play basketball,\nbut the last few times I\u2019ve been to the gymnasium there haven\u2019t been\nenough people to get up a game. Two or three of us got to throwing\nthe ball around the other night\u2014and I got a black eye. I wish all of\nyou would come down tomorrow night. I want to play basketball.\u201d\nDid he talk about anything you want? You don\u2019t want to go to a\ngymnasium that no one else goes to, do you? You don\u2019t care about\nwhat he wants. You don\u2019t want to get a black eye.\nCould he have shown you how to get the things you want by using\nthe gymnasium? Surely. More pep. Keener edge to the appetite.\nClearer brain. Fun. Games. Basketball.\nTo repeat Professor Overstreet\u2019s wise advice: First, arouse in the\nother person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world\nwith him. He who cannot walks a lonely way.\nOne of the students in the author\u2019s training course was worried\nabout his little boy. The child was underweight and refused to eat\nproperly. His parents used the usual method. They scolded and\nnagged. \u201cMother wants you to eat this and that.\u201d \u201cFather wants you\nto grow up to be a big man.\u201d\nDid the boy pay any attention to these pleas? Just about as much\nas you pay to one fleck of sand on a sandy beach.\nNo one with a trace of horse sense would expect a child three\nyears old to react to the viewpoint of a father thirty years old. Yet that\nwas precisely what that father had expected. It was absurd. He\nfinally saw that. So he said to himself: \u201cWhat does that boy want?\nHow can I tie up what I want to what he wants?\u201d\nIt was easy for the father when he started thinking about it. His boy\nhad a tricycle that he loved to ride up and down the sidewalk in front\nof the house in Brooklyn. A few doors down the street lived a bully\u2014\na bigger boy who would pull the little boy off his tricycle and ride it\nhimself.\nNaturally, the little boy would run screaming to his mother, and she\nwould have to come out and take the bully off the tricycle and put her\nlittle boy on again. This happened almost every day.\nWhat did the little boy want? It didn\u2019t take a Sherlock Holmes to\nanswer that one. His pride, his anger, his desire for a feeling of\nimportance\u2014all the strongest emotions in his makeup\u2014goaded him\nto get revenge, to smash the bully in the nose. And when his father\nexplained that the boy would be able to wallop the daylights out of\nthe bigger kid someday if he would only eat the things his mother\nwanted him to eat\u2014when his father promised him that\u2014there was\nno longer any problem of dietetics. That boy would have eaten\nspinach, sauerkraut, salt mackerel\u2014anything in order to be big\nenough to whip the bully who had humiliated him so often.\nAfter solving that problem, the parents tackled another: the little\nboy had the unholy habit of wetting his bed.\nHe slept with his grandmother. In the morning, his grandmother\nwould wake up and feel the sheet and say: \u201cLook, Johnny, what you\ndid again last night.\u201d\nHe would say: \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t do it. You did it.\u201d\nScolding, spanking, shaming him, reiterating that the parents didn\u2019t\nwant him to do it\u2014none of these things kept the bed dry. So the\nparents asked: \u201cHow can we make this boy want to stop wetting his\nbed?\u201d\nWhat were his wants? First, he wanted to wear pajamas like Daddy\ninstead of wearing a nightgown like Grandmother. Grandmother was\ngetting fed up with his nocturnal iniquities, so she gladly offered to\nbuy him a pair of pajamas if he would reform. Second, he wanted a\nbed of his own. Grandma didn\u2019t object.\nHis mother took him to a department store in Brooklyn, winked at\nthe salesgirl, and said: \u201cHere is a little gentleman who would like to\ndo some shopping.\u201d\nThe salesgirl made him feel important by saying: \u201cYoung man, what\ncan I show you?\u201d\nHe stood a couple of inches taller and said: \u201cI want to buy a bed for\nmyself.\u201d\nWhen he was shown the one his mother wanted him to buy, she\nwinked at the salesgirl and the boy was persuaded to buy it.\nThe bed was delivered the next day; and that night, when Father\ncame home, the little boy ran to the door shouting: \u201cDaddy! Daddy!\nCome upstairs and see my bed that I bought!\u201d\nThe father, looking at the bed, obeyed Charles Schwab\u2019s\ninjunction: he was \u201chearty in his approbation and lavish in his praise.\u201d\n\u201cYou are not going to wet this bed, are you?\u201d the father said.\n\u201cOh, no, no! I am not going to wet this bed.\u201d The boy kept his\npromise, for his pride was involved. That was his bed. He and he\nalone had bought it. And he was wearing pajamas now like a little\nman. He wanted to act like a man. And he did.\nAnother father, K. T. Dutschmann, a telephone engineer, a student\nof this course, couldn\u2019t get his three-year-old daughter to eat\nbreakfast food. The usual scolding, pleading, coaxing methods had\nall ended in futility. So the parents asked themselves: \u201cHow can we\nmake her want to do it?\u201d\nThe little girl loved to imitate her mother, to feel big and grown up;\nso one morning they put her on a chair and let her make the\nbreakfast food. At just the psychological moment, Father drifted into\nthe kitchen while she was stirring the cereal and she said: \u201cOh, look,\nDaddy, I am making the cereal this morning.\u201d\nShe ate two helpings of the cereal without any coaxing, because\nshe was interested in it. She had achieved a feeling of importance;\nshe had found in making the cereal an avenue of self-expression.\nWilliam Winter once remarked that \u201cself-expression is the dominant\nnecessity of human nature.\u201d Why can\u2019t we adapt this same\npsychology to business dealings? When we have a brilliant idea,\ninstead of making others think it is ours, why not let them cook and\nstir the idea themselves. They will then regard it as their own; they\nwill like it and maybe eat a couple of helpings of it.\nRemember: \u201cFirst, arouse in the other person an eager want.

When you get within ten feet of him, he will begin to wag his\ntail. If you stop and pat him, he will almost jump out of his skin to\nshow you how much he likes you. And you know that behind this\nshow of affection on his part, there are no ulterior motives: he\ndoesn\u2019t want to sell you any real estate, and he doesn\u2019t want to\nmarry you.\nDid you ever stop to think that a dog is the only animal that doesn\u2019t\nhave to work for a living?

Every\nafternoon about four-thirty, he would sit in the front yard with his\nbeautiful eyes staring steadfastly at the path, and as soon as he\nheard my voice or saw me swinging my dinner pail through the buck\nbrush, he was off like a shot, racing breathlessly up the hill to greet\nme with leaps of joy and barks of sheer ecstasy.\nTippy was my constant companion for five years. Then one tragic\nnight\u2014I shall never forget it\u2014he was killed within ten feet of my\nhead, killed by lightning. Tippy\u2019s death was the tragedy of my\nboyhood.\nYou never read a book on psychology, Tippy. You didn\u2019t need to.\nYou knew by some divine instinct that you can make more friends in\ntwo months by becoming genuinely interested in other people than\nyou can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.\nLet me repeat that. You can make more friends in two months by\nbecoming interested in other people than you can in two years by\ntrying to get other people interested in you.\nYet I know and you know people who blunder through life trying to\nwigwag other people into becoming interested in them.\nOf course, it doesn\u2019t work. People are not interested in you. They\nare not interested in me. They are interested in themselves\u2014\nmorning, noon and after dinner.\nThe New York Telephone Company made a detailed study of\ntelephone conversations to find out which word is the most\nfrequently used. You have guessed it: it is the personal pronoun \u201cI.\u201d\n\u201cI.\u201d \u201cI.\u201d It was used 3,900 times in 500 telephone conversations. \u201cI.\u201d\n\u201cI.\u201d \u201cI.\u201d \u201cI.\u201d\nWhen you see a group photograph that you are in, whose picture\ndo you look for first?\nIf we merely try to impress people and get people interested in us,\nwe will never have many true, sincere friends.

In that book he says: \u201cIt is\nthe individual who is not interested in his fellow men who has the\ngreatest difficulties in life and provides the greatest injury to others. It\nis from among such individuals that all human failures spring.\u201d\nYou may read scores of erudite tomes on psychology without\ncoming across a statement more significant for you and for me.\nAdler\u2019s statement is so rich with meaning that I am going to repeat it\nin italics:\nIt is the individual who is not interested in his fellow men who\nhas the greatest difficulties in life and provides the greatest injury\nto others. It is from among such individuals that all human\nfailures spring.\nI once took a course in short-story writing at New York University,\nand during that course the editor of a leading magazine talked to our\nclass. He said he could pick up any one of the dozens of stories that\ndrifted across his desk every day and after reading a few paragraphs\nhe could feel whether or not the author liked people. \u201cIf the author\ndoesn\u2019t like people,\u201d he said, \u201cpeople won\u2019t like his or her stories.\u201d\nThis hard-boiled editor stopped twice in the course of his talk on\nfiction writing and apologized for preaching a sermon. \u201cI am telling\nyou,\u201d he said, \u201cthe same things your preacher would tell you, but\nremember, you have to be interested in people if you want to be a\nsuccessful writer of stories.\u201d\nIf that is true of writing fiction, you can be sure it is true of dealing\nwith people face-to-face.\nI spent an evening in the dressing room of Howard Thurston the\nlast time he appeared on Broadway\u2014Thurston was the\nacknowledged dean of magicians. For forty years he had traveled all\nover the world, time and again, creating illusions, mystifying\naudiences, and making people gasp with astonishment. More than\n60 million people had paid admission to his show, and he had made\nalmost $2 million in profit.\nI asked Mr. Thurston to tell me the secret of his success. His\nschooling certainly had nothing to do with it, for he ran away from\nhome as a small boy, became a hobo, rode in boxcars, slept in\nhaystacks, begged his food from door to door, and learned to read\nby looking out of boxcars at signs along the railway.\nDid he have a superior knowledge of magic? No, he told me\nhundreds of books had been written about legerdemain and scores\nof people knew as much about it as he did. But he had two things\nthat the others didn\u2019t have. First, he had the ability to put his\npersonality across the footlights. He was a master showman. He\nknew human nature. Everything he did, every gesture, every\nintonation of his voice, every lifting of an eyebrow had been carefully\nrehearsed in advance, and his actions were timed to split seconds.\nBut, in addition to that, Thurston had a genuine interest in people. He\ntold me that many magicians would look at the audience and say to\nthemselves, \u201cWell, there is a bunch of suckers out there, a bunch of\nhicks; I\u2019ll fool them all right.\u201d But Thurston\u2019s method was totally\ndifferent. He told me that every time he went on stage he said to\nhimself: \u201cI am grateful because these people come to see me. They\nmake it possible for me to make my living in a very agreeable way.\nI\u2019m going to give them the very best I possibly can.\u201d\nHe declared he never stepped in front of the footlights without first\nsaying to himself over and over: \u201cI love my audience. I love my\naudience.\u201d Ridiculous? Absurd? You are privileged to think anything\nyou like. I am merely passing it on to you without comment as a\nrecipe used by one of the most famous magicians of all time.\nGeorge Dyke of North Warren, Pennsylvania, was forced to retire\nfrom his service station business after thirty years when a new\nhighway was constructed over the site of his station. It wasn\u2019t long\nbefore the idle days of retirement began to bore him, so he started\nfilling in his time trying to play music on his old fiddle. Soon he was\ntraveling the area to listen to music and talk with many of the\naccomplished fiddlers. In his humble and friendly way he became\ngenerally interested in learning the background and interests of\nevery musician he met. Although he was not a great fiddler himself,\nhe made many friends in this pursuit. He attended competitions and\nsoon became known to the country music fans in the eastern part of\nthe United States as \u201cUncle George, the Fiddle Scraper from Kinzua\nCounty.\u201d When we heard Uncle George, he was seventy-two and\nenjoying every minute of his life. By having a sustained interest in\nother people, he created a new life for himself at a time when most\npeople consider their productive years over.\nThat, too, was one of the secrets of Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s\nastonishing popularity. Even his servants loved him. His valet, James\nE. Amos, wrote a book about him entitled Theodore Roosevelt, Hero\nto His Valet. In that book Amos relates this illuminating incident:\nMy wife one time asked the President about a bobwhite. She\nhad never seen one and he described it to her fully. Sometime\nlater, the telephone at our cottage rang. ","[Amos and his wife lived\nin a little cottage on the Roosevelt estate at Oyster Bay.]"," My wife\nanswered it and it was Mr. Roosevelt himself. He had called her,\nhe said, to tell her that there was a bobwhite outside her window\nand that if she would look out she might see it. Little things like\nthat were so characteristic of him. Whenever he went by our\ncottage, even though we were out of sight, we would hear him\ncall out: \u201cOo-oo-oo, Annie?\u201d or \u201cOo-oo-oo, James!\u201d It was just a\nfriendly greeting as he went by.\nHow could employees keep from liking a man like that? How could\nanyone keep from liking him?\nRoosevelt called at the White House one day when the President\nand Mrs. Taft were away. His honest liking for humble people was\nshown by the fact that he greeted all the old White House servants\nby name, even the scullery maids.\n\u201cWhen he saw Alice, the kitchen maid,\u201d writes Archie Butt, \u201che\nasked her if she still made corn bread. Alice told him that she\nsometimes made it for the servants, but no one ate it upstairs.\n\u201c\u2018They show bad taste,\u2019 Roosevelt boomed, \u2018and I\u2019ll tell the\nPresident so when I see him.\u2019\n\u201cAlice brought a piece to him on a plate, and he went over to the\noffice eating it as he went and greeting gardeners and laborers as he\npassed. . . .\n\u201cHe addressed each person just as he had addressed them in the\npast. Ike Hoover, who had been head usher at the White House for\nforty years, said with tears in his eyes: \u2018It is the only happy day we\nhad in nearly two years, and not one of us would exchange it for a\nhundred-dollar bill.\u2019\u201d\nThe same concern for the seemingly unimportant people helped\nsales representative Edward M. Sykes, Jr., of Chatham, New Jersey,\nretain an account. \u201cMany years ago,\u201d he reported, \u201cI called on\ncustomers for Johnson and Johnson in the Massachusetts area. One\naccount was a drugstore in Hingham. Whenever I went into this store\nI would always talk to the soda clerk and sales clerk for a few\nminutes before talking to the owner to obtain his order. One day I\nwent up to the owner of the store, and he told me to, leave as he\nwas not interested in buying J&J products anymore because he felt\nthey were concentrating their activities on food and discount stores\nto the detriment of the small drugstore. I left with my tail between my\nlegs and drove around the town for several hours. Finally, I decided\nto go back and try at least to explain our position to the owner of the\nstore.\n\u201cWhen I returned I walked in and as usual said hello to the soda\nclerk and sales clerk. When I walked up to the owner, he smiled at\nme and welcomed me back. He then gave me double the usual\norder. I looked at him with surprise and asked him what had\nhappened since my visit only a few hours earlier. He pointed to the\nyoung man at the soda fountain and said that after I had left, the boy\nhad come over and said that I was one of the few salespeople that\ncalled on the store that even bothered to say hello to him and to the\nothers in the store. He told the owner that if any salesperson\ndeserved his business, it was I. The owner agreed and remained a\nloyal customer. I never forgot that to be genuinely interested in other\npeople is a most important quality for a salesperson to possess\u2014for\nany person, for that matter.\u201d\nI have discovered from personal experience that one can win the\nattention and time and cooperation of even the most sought-after\npeople by becoming genuinely interested in them. Let me illustrate.\nYears ago I conducted a course in fiction writing at the Brooklyn\nInstitute of Arts and Sciences, and we wanted such distinguished\nand busy authors as Kathleen Norris, Fannie Hurst, Ida Tarbell,\nAlbert Payson Terhune and Rupert Hughes to come to Brooklyn and\ngive us the benefit of their experiences. So we wrote them, saying\nwe admired their work and were deeply interested in getting their\nadvice and learning the secrets of their success.\nEach of these letters was signed by about a hundred and fifty\nstudents. We said we realized that these authors were busy\u2014too\nbusy to prepare a lecture. So we enclosed a list of questions for\nthem to answer about themselves and their methods of work. They\nliked that. Who wouldn\u2019t like it? So they left their homes and traveled\nto Brooklyn to give us a helping hand.\nBy using the same method, I persuaded Leslie M. Shaw, secretary\nof the treasury in Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s cabinet; George W.\nWickersham, attorney general in Taft\u2019s cabinet; William Jennings\nBryan; Franklin D. Roosevelt and many other prominent men to\ncome to talk to the students of my courses in public speaking.\nAll of us, be we workers in a factory, clerks in an office or even a\nking upon his throne\u2014all of us like people who admire us. Take the\nGerman Kaiser, for example. At the close of World War I he was\nprobably the most savagely and universally despised man on this\nearth. Even his own nation turned against him when he fled over into\nHolland to save his neck. The hatred against him was so intense that\nmillions of people would have loved to tear him limb from limb or\nburn him at the stake. In the midst of all this forest fire of fury, one\nlittle boy wrote the Kaiser a simple, sincere letter glowing with\nkindliness and admiration. This little boy said that no matter what the\nothers thought, he would always love Wilhelm as his emperor. The\nKaiser was deeply touched by his letter and invited the little boy to\ncome to see him. The boy came, so did his mother\u2014and the Kaiser\nmarried her. That little boy didn\u2019t need to read a book on how to win\nfriends and influence people. He knew how instinctively.\nIf we want to make friends, let\u2019s put ourselves out to do things for\nother people\u2014things that require time, energy, unselfishness and\nthoughtfulness. When the Duke of Windsor was Prince of Wales, he\nwas scheduled to tour South America, and before he started out on\nthat tour he spent months studying Spanish so that he could make\npublic talks in the language of the country; and the South Americans\nloved him for it.\nFor years I made it a point to find out the birthdays of my friends.\nHow? Although I haven\u2019t the foggiest bit of faith in astrology, I began\nby asking the other party whether he believed the date of one\u2019s birth\nhas anything to do with character and disposition. I then asked him\nor her to tell me the month and day of birth. If he or she said\nNovember 24, for example, I kept repeating to myself, \u201cNovember\n24, November 24.\u201d The minute my friend\u2019s back was turned, I wrote\ndown the name and birthday and later would transfer it to a birthday\nbook. At the beginning of each year, I had these birthday dates\nscheduled in my calendar pad so that they came to my attention\nautomatically. When the natal day arrived, there was my letter or\ntelegram. What a hit it made! I was frequently the only person on\nearth who remembered.\nIf we want to make friends, let\u2019s greet people with animation and\nenthusiasm. When somebody calls you on the telephone use the\nsame psychology. Say \u201cHello\u201d in tones that bespeak how pleased\nyou are to have the person call. Many companies train their\ntelephone operators to greet all callers in a tone of voice that\nradiates interest and enthusiasm. The caller feels the company is\nconcerned about them. Let\u2019s remember that when we answer the\ntelephone tomorrow.\nShowing a genuine interest in others not only wins friends for you,\nbut may develop in its customers a loyalty to your company. In an\nissue of the publication of the National Bank of North America of\nNew York, the following letter from Madeline Rosedale, a depositor,\nwas published:*\nI would like you to know how much I appreciate your staff.\nEveryone is so courteous, polite and helpful. What a pleasure it\nis, after waiting on a long line, to have the teller greet you\npleasantly.\nLast year my mother was hospitalized for five months.\nFrequently I went to Marie Petrucello, a teller. She was\nconcerned about my mother and inquired about her progress.\nIs there any doubt that Mrs. Rosedale will continue to use this\nbank?\nCharles R. Walters, of one of the large banks in New York City, was\nassigned to prepare a confidential report on a certain corporation. He\nknew of only one person who possessed the facts he needed so\nurgently. As Mr. Walters was ushered into the president\u2019s office, a\nyoung woman stuck her head through a door and told the president\nthat she didn\u2019t have any stamps for him that day.\n\u201cI am collecting stamps for my twelve-year-old son,\u201d the president\nexplained to Mr. Walters.\nMr. Walters stated his mission and began asking questions. The\npresident was vague, general, nebulous. He didn\u2019t want to talk, and\napparently nothing could persuade him to talk. The interview was\nbrief and barren.\n\u201cFrankly, I didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Mr. Walters said as he related\nthe story to the class. \u201cThen I remembered what his secretary had\nsaid to him\u2014stamps, twelve-year-old son. . . . And I also recalled\nthat the foreign department of our bank collected stamps\u2014stamps\ntaken from letters pouring in from every continent washed by the\nseven seas.\n\u201cThe next afternoon I called on this man and sent in word that I had\nsome stamps for his boy. Was I ushered in with enthusiasm? Yes sir.\nHe couldn\u2019t have shaken my hand with more enthusiasm if he had\nbeen running for Congress. He radiated smiles and good will. \u2018My\nGeorge will love this one,\u2019 he kept saying as he fondled the stamps.\n\u2018And look at this! This is a treasure.\u2019\n\u201cWe spent half an hour talking stamps and looking at a picture of\nhis boy, and he then devoted more than an hour of his time to giving\nme every bit of information I wanted\u2014without my even suggesting\nthat he do it. He told me all he knew, and then called in his\nsubordinates and questioned them. He telephoned some of his\nassociates. He loaded me down with facts, figures, reports and\ncorrespondence. In the parlance of newspaper reporters, I had a\nscoop.\u201d\nHere is another illustration:\nC. M. Knaphle, Jr., of Philadelphia had tried for years to sell fuel to\na large chain-store organization. But the chain-store company\ncontinued to purchase its fuel from an out-of-town dealer and haul it\nright past the door of Knaphle\u2019s office. Mr. Knaphle made a speech\none night before one of my classes, pouring out his hot wrath upon\nchain stores, branding them as a curse to the nation.\nAnd still he wondered why he couldn\u2019t sell them.\nI suggested that he try different tactics. To put it briefly, this is what\nhappened. We staged a debate between members of the course on\nwhether the spread of the chain store is doing the country more\nharm than good.\nKnaphle, at my suggestion, took the negative side; he agreed to\ndefend the chain stores, and then went straight to an executive of\nthe chain-store organization that he despised and said: \u201cI am not\nhere to try to sell fuel. I have come to ask you to do me a favor.\u201d He\nthen told about his debate and said, \u201cI have come to you for help\nbecause I can\u2019t think of anyone else who would be more capable of\ngiving me the facts I want. I\u2019m anxious to win this debate, and I\u2019ll\ndeeply appreciate whatever help you can give me.\u201d\nHere is the rest of the story in Mr. Knaphle\u2019s own words:\nI had asked this man for precisely one minute of his time. It\nwas with that understanding that he consented to see me. After I\nhad stated my case, he motioned me to a chair and talked to me\nfor exactly one hour and forty-seven minutes. He called in\nanother executive who had written a book on chain stores. He\nwrote to the National Chain Store Association and secured for\nme a copy of a debate on the subject. He feels that the chain\nstore is rendering a real service to humanity. He is proud of what\nhe is doing for hundreds of communities. His eyes fairly glowed\nas he talked, and I must confess that he opened my eyes to\nthings I had never even dreamed of. He changed my whole\nmental attitude.\nAs I was leaving, he walked with me to the door, put his arm\naround my shoulder, wished me well in my debate, and asked\nme to stop in and see him again and let him know how I made\nout. The last words he said to me were: \u201cPlease see me again\nlater in the spring. I should like to place an order with you for\nfuel.\u201d\nTo me that was almost a miracle. Here he was offering to buy\nfuel without my even suggesting it. I had made more headway in\ntwo hours by becoming genuinely interested in him and his\nproblems than I could have made in ten years trying to get him\ninterested in me and my product.\nYou didn\u2019t discover a new truth, Mr. Knaphle, for a long time ago, a\nhundred years before Christ was born, a famous old Roman poet,\nPublilius Syrus, remarked: \u201cWe are interested in others when they\nare interested in us.\u201d\nA show of interest, as with every other principle of human relations,\nmust be sincere. It must pay off not only for the person showing the\ninterest, but for the person receiving the attention. It is a two-way\nstreet\u2014both parties benefit.\nMartin Ginsberg, who took our course in Long Island, New York,\nreported how the special interest a nurse took in him profoundly\naffected his life:\n\u201cIt was Thanksgiving Day and I was ten years old. I was in a\nwelfare ward of a city hospital and was scheduled to undergo major\northopedic surgery the next day. I knew that I could only look forward\nto months of confinement, convalescence and pain. My father was\ndead; my mother and I lived alone in a small apartment and we were\non welfare. My mother was unable to visit me that day.\n\u201cAs the day went on, I became overwhelmed with the feeling of\nloneliness, despair and fear. I knew my mother was home alone\nworrying about me, not having anyone to be with, not having anyone\nto eat with and not even having enough money to afford a\nThanksgiving Day dinner.\n\u201cThe tears welled up in my eyes, and I stuck my head under the\npillow and pulled the covers over it. I cried silently, but oh so bitterly,\nso much that my body racked with pain.\n\u201cA young student nurse heard my sobbing and came over to me.\nShe took the covers off my face and started wiping my tears. She\ntold me how lonely she was, having to work that day and not being\nable to be with her family. She asked me whether I would have\ndinner with her. She brought two trays of food: sliced turkey, mashed\npotatoes, cranberry sauce and ice cream for dessert. She talked to\nme and tried to calm my fears. Even though she was scheduled to\ngo off duty at 4 p.m., she stayed on her own time until almost 11 p.m.\nShe played games with me, talked to me and stayed with me until I\nfinally fell asleep.\n\u201cMany Thanksgivings have come and gone since I was ten, but\none never passes without me remembering that particular one and\nmy feelings of frustration, fear, loneliness and the warmth and\ntenderness of the stranger that somehow made it all bearable.\u201d\nIf you want others to like you, if you want to develop real\nfriendships, if you want to help others at the same time as you help\nyourself, keep this principle in mind:\nPRINCIPLE 1\nBecome genuinely interested in other people."),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},"Eagle, publication of the National Bank of North America, New\nYork, March 31, 1978.\n2\nA Simple Way to Make a Good First Impression\nAt a dinner party in New York, one of the guests, a woman who had\ninherited money, was eager to make a pleasing impression on\neveryone. She had squandered a modest fortune on sables,\ndiamonds and pearls. But she hadn\u2019t done anything whatever about\nher face. It radiated sourness and selfishness. She didn\u2019t realize\nwhat everyone knows: namely, that the expression one wears on\none\u2019s face is far more important than the clothes one wears on one\u2019s\nback.\nCharles Schwab told me his smile had been worth a million dollars.\nAnd he was probably understating the truth. For Schwab\u2019s\npersonality, his charm, his ability to make people like him, were\nalmost wholly responsible for his extraordinary success; and one of\nthe most delightful factors in his personality was his captivating\nsmile.\nActions speak louder than words, and a smile says, \u201cI like you. You\nmake me happy. I am glad to see you.\u201d\nThat is why dogs make such a hit. They are so glad to see us that\nthey almost jump out of their skins. So, naturally, we are glad to see\nthem.\nA baby\u2019s smile has the same effect.\nHave you ever been in a doctor\u2019s waiting room and looked around\nat all the glum faces waiting impatiently to be seen? Dr. Stephen K.\nSproul, a veterinarian in Raytown, Missouri, told of a typical spring\nday when his waiting room was full of clients waiting to have their\npets inoculated. No one was talking to anyone else, and all were\nprobably thinking of a dozen other things they would rather be doing\nthan \u201cwasting time\u201d sitting in that office. He told one of our classes:\n\u201cThere were six or seven clients waiting when a young woman came\nin with a nine-month-old baby and a kitten. As luck would have it,\nshe sat down next to a gentleman who was more than a little\ndistraught about the long wait for service. The next thing he knew,\nthe baby just looked up at him with that great big smile that is so\ncharacteristic of babies. What did that gentleman do? Just what you\nand I would do, of course; he smiled back at the baby. Soon he\nstruck up a conversation with the woman about her baby and his\ngrandchildren, and soon the entire reception room joined in, and the\nboredom and tension were converted into a pleasant and enjoyable\nexperience.\u201d\nAn insincere grin? No. That doesn\u2019t fool anybody. We know it is\nmechanical and we resent it. I am talking about a real smile, a\nheartwarming smile, a smile that comes from within, the kind of smile\nthat will bring a good price in the marketplace.\nProfessor James V. McConnell, a psychologist at the University of\nMichigan, expressed his feelings about a smile. \u201cPeople who smile,\u201d\nhe said, \u201ctend to manage, teach and sell more effectively, and to\nraise happier children. There\u2019s far more information in a smile than a\nfrown. That\u2019s why encouragement is a much more effective teaching\ndevice than punishment.\u201d\nThe employment manager of a large New York department store\ntold me she would rather hire a sales clerk who hadn\u2019t finished grade\nschool, if he or she has a pleasant smile, than to hire a doctor of\nphilosophy with a somber face.\nThe effect of a smile is powerful\u2014even when it is unseen.\nTelephone companies throughout the United States have a program\ncalled \u201cphone power\u201d which is offered to employees who use the\ntelephone for selling their services or products. In this program they\nsuggest that you smile when talking on the phone. Your \u201csmile\u201d\ncomes through in your voice.\nRobert Cryer, manager of a computer department for a Cincinnati,\nOhio, company, told how he had successfully found the right\napplicant for a hard-to-fill position:\n\u201cI was desperately trying to recruit a Ph.D. in computer science for\nmy department. I finally located a young man with ideal qualifications\nwho was about to be graduated from Purdue University. After several\nphone conversations I learned that he had several offers from other\ncompanies, many of them larger and better known than mine. I was\ndelighted when he accepted my offer. After he started on the job, I\nasked him why he had chosen us over the others. He paused for a\nmoment and then he said: \u2018I think it was because managers in the\nother companies spoke on the phone in a cold, business-like\nmanner, which made me feel like just another business transaction.\nYour voice sounded as if you were glad to hear from me . . . that you\nreally wanted me to be part of your organization.\u2019 You can be\nassured, I am still answering my phone with a smile.\u201d\nThe chairman of the board of directors of one of the largest rubber\ncompanies in the United States told me that, according to his\nobservations, people rarely succeed at anything unless they have\nfun doing it. This industrial leader doesn\u2019t put much faith in the old\nadage that hard work alone is the magic key that will unlock the door\nto our desires. \u201cI have known people,\u201d he said, \u201cwho succeeded\nbecause they had a rip-roaring good time conducting their business.\nLater, I saw those people change as the fun became work. The\nbusiness had grown dull. They lost all joy in it, and they failed.\u201d\nYou must have a good time meeting people if you expect them to\nhave a good time meeting you.\nI have asked thousands of business people to smile at someone\nevery hour of the day for a week and then come to class and talk\nabout the results. How did it work? Let\u2019s see . . . Here is a letter from\nWilliam B. Steinhardt, a New York stockbroker. His case isn\u2019t\nisolated. In fact, it is typical of hundreds of cases.\n\u201cI have been married for over eighteen years,\u201d wrote Mr.\nSteinhardt, \u201cand in all that time I seldom smiled at my wife or spoke\ntwo dozen words to her from the time I got up until I was ready to\nleave for business. I was one of the worst grouches who ever walked\ndown Broadway.\n\u201cWhen you asked me to make a talk about my experience with\nsmiles, I thought I would try it for a week. So the next morning, while\ncombing my hair, I looked at my glum mug in the mirror and said to\nmyself, \u2018Bill, you are going to wipe the scowl off that sour puss of\nyours today. You are going to smile. And you are going to begin right\nnow.\u2019 As I sat down to breakfast, I greeted my wife with a \u2018Good\nmorning, my dear,\u2019 and smiled as I said it.\n\u201cYou warned me that she might be surprised. Well, you\nunderestimated her reaction. She was bewildered. She was\nshocked. I told her that in the future she could expect this as a\nregular occurrence, and I kept it up every morning.\n\u201cThis changed attitude of mine brought more happiness into our\nhome in the two months since I started than there was during the last\nyear.\n\u201cAs I leave for my office, I greet the elevator operator in the\napartment house with a \u2018Good morning\u2019 and a smile. I greet the\ndoorman with a smile. I smile at the cashier in the subway booth\nwhen I ask for change. As I stand on the floor of the Stock\nExchange, I smile at people who until recently never saw me smile.\n\u201cI soon found that everybody was smiling back at me. I treat those\nwho come to me with complaints or grievances in a cheerful manner.\nI smile as I listen to them and I find that adjustments are\naccomplished much easier. I find that smiles are bringing me dollars,\nmany dollars every day.\n\u201cI share my office with another broker. One of his clerks is a likable\nyoung chap, and I was so elated about the results I was getting that I\ntold him recently about my new philosophy of human relations. He\nthen confessed that when I first came to share my office with his firm\nhe thought me a terrible grouch\u2014and only recently changed his\nmind. He said I was really human when I smiled.\n\u201cI have also eliminated criticism from my system. I give\nappreciation and praise now instead of condemnation. I have\nstopped talking about what I want. I am now trying to see the other\nperson\u2019s viewpoint. And these things have literally revolutionized my\nlife. I am a totally different man, a happier man, a richer man, richer\nin friendships and happiness\u2014the only things that matter much after\nall.\u201d\nYou don\u2019t feel like smiling? Then what? Two things. First, force\nyourself to smile. If you are alone, force yourself to whistle or hum a\ntune or sing. Act as if you were already happy, and that will tend to\nmake you happy. Here is the way the psychologist and philosopher\nWilliam James put it:\n\u201cAction seems to follow feeling, but really action and feeling go\ntogether; and by regulating the action, which is under the more direct\ncontrol of the will, we can indirectly regulate the feeling, which is not.\n\u201cThus the sovereign voluntary path to cheerfulness, if our\ncheerfulness be lost, is to sit up cheerfully and to act and speak as if\ncheerfulness were already there. . . .\u201d\nEverybody in the world is seeking happiness\u2014and there is one\nsure way to find it. That is by controlling your thoughts. Happiness\ndoesn\u2019t depend on outward conditions. It depends on inner\nconditions.\nIt isn\u2019t what you have or who you are or where you are or what you\nare doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what you think\nabout it. For example, two people may be in the same place, doing\nthe same thing; both may have about an equal amount of money and\nprestige\u2014and yet one may be miserable and the other happy. Why?\nBecause of a different mental attitude. I have seen just as many\nhappy faces among the poor peasants toiling with their primitive\ntools in the devastating heat of the tropics as I have seen in air\x02conditioned offices in New York, Chicago or Los Angeles.\n\u201cThere is nothing either good or bad,\u201d said Shakespeare, \u201cbut\nthinking makes it so.\u201d\nAbe Lincoln once remarked that \u201cmost folks are about as happy as\nthey make up their minds to be.\u201d He was right. I saw a vivid\nillustration of that truth as I was walking up the stairs of the Long\nIsland Railroad station in New York. Directly in front of me thirty or\nforty crippled boys on canes and crutches were struggling up the\nstairs. One boy had to be carried up. I was astonished at their\nlaughter and gaiety. I spoke about it to one of the men in charge of\nthe boys. \u201cOh, yes,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen a boy realizes that he is going to\nbe a cripple for life, he is shocked at first; but after he gets over the\nshock, he usually resigns himself to his fate and then becomes as\nhappy as normal boys.\u201d\nI felt like taking my hat off to those boys. They taught me a lesson I\nhope I shall never forget.\nWorking all by oneself in a closed-off room in an office not only is\nlonely, but it denies one the opportunity of making friends with other\nemployees in the company. Se\xf1ora Maria Gonzalez of Guadalajara,\nMexico, had such a job. She envied the shared comradeship of other\npeople in the company as she heard their chatter and laughter. As\nshe passed them in the hall during the first weeks of her\nemployment, she shyly looked the other way.\nAfter a few weeks, she said to herself, \u201cMaria, you can\u2019t expect\nthose women to come to you. You have to go out and meet them.\u201d\nThe next time she walked to the water cooler, she put on her\nbrightest smile and said, \u201cHi, how are you today\u201d to each of the\npeople she met. The effect was immediate. Smiles and hellos were\nreturned, the hallway seemed brighter, the job friendlier.\nAcquaintanceships developed and some ripened into friendships.\nHer job and her life became more pleasant and interesting.\nPeruse this bit of sage advice from the essayist and publisher\nElbert Hubbard\u2014but remember, perusing it won\u2019t do you any good\nunless you apply it:\nWhenever you go out-of-doors, draw the chin in, carry the\ncrown of the head high, and fill the lungs to the utmost; drink in\nthe sunshine; greet your friends with a smile, and put soul into\nevery handclasp. Do not fear being misunderstood and do not\nwaste a minute thinking about your enemies. Try to fix firmly in\nyour mind what you would like to do; and then, without veering\noff direction, you will move straight to the goal. Keep your mind\non the great and splendid things you would like to do, and then,\nas the days go gliding away, you will find yourself unconsciously\nseizing upon the opportunities that are required for the fulfillment\nof your desire, just as the coral insect takes from the running tide\nthe element it needs. Picture in your mind the able, earnest,\nuseful person you desire to be, and the thought you hold is\nhourly transforming you into that particular individual. . . .\nThought is supreme. Preserve a right mental attitude\u2014the\nattitude of courage, frankness, and good cheer. To think rightly is\nto create. All things come through desire and every sincere\nprayer is answered. We become like that on which our hearts\nare fixed. Carry your chin in and the crown of your head high.\nWe are gods in the chrysalis.\nThe ancient Chinese were a wise lot\u2014wise in the ways of the\nworld; and they had a proverb that you and I ought to cut out and\npaste inside our hats. It goes like this: \u201cA man without a smiling face\nmust not open a shop.\u201d\nYour smile is a messenger of your good will. Your smile brightens\nthe lives of all who see it. To someone who has seen a dozen people\nfrown, scowl or turn their faces away, your smile is like the sun\nbreaking through the clouds. Especially when that someone is under\npressure from his bosses, his customers, his teachers or parents or\nchildren, a smile can help him realize that all is not hopeless\u2014that\nthere is joy in the world.\nSome years ago, a department store in New York City, in\nrecognition of the pressures its sales clerks were under during the\nChristmas rush, presented the readers of its advertisements with the\nfollowing homely philosophy:\nThe Value of a Smile at Christmas\nIt costs nothing, but creates much.\nIt enriches those who receive, without impoverishing those who\ngive.\nIt happens in a flash and the memory of it sometimes lasts forever.\nNone are so rich they can get along without it, and none so poor\nbut are richer for its benefits.\nIt creates happiness in the home, fosters good will in a business,\nand is the countersign of friends.\nIt is rest to the weary, daylight to the discouraged, sunshine to the\nsad, and Nature\u2019s best antidote for trouble.\nYet it cannot be bought, begged, borrowed, or stolen, for it is\nsomething that is no earthly good to anybody till it is given away.\nAnd if in the last-minute rush of Christmas buying some of our\nsalespeople should be too tired to give you a smile, may we ask\nyou to leave one of yours?\nFor nobody needs a smile so much as those who have none left to\ngive!\nPRINCIPLE 2\nSmile.\n3\nIf You Don\u2019t Do This, You Are Headed for Trouble\nBack in 1898, a tragic thing happened in Rockland County, New\nYork. A child had died, and on this particular day the neighbors were\npreparing to go to the funeral. Jim Farley went out to the barn to\nhitch up his horse. The ground was covered with snow, the air was\ncold and snappy; the horse hadn\u2019t been exercised for days; and as\nhe was led out to the watering trough, he wheeled playfully, kicked\nboth his heels high in the air, and killed Jim Farley. So the little\nvillage of Stony Point had two funerals that week instead of one.\nJim Farley left behind him a widow and three boys, and a few\nhundred dollars in insurance.\nHis oldest boy, Jim, was ten, and he went to work in a brickyard,\nwheeling sand and pouring it into the molds and turning the brick on\nedge to be dried by the sun. This boy Jim never had a chance to get\nmuch education. But with his natural geniality, he had a flair for\nmaking people like him, so he went into politics, and as the years\nwent by, he developed an uncanny ability for remembering people\u2019s\nnames.\nHe never saw the inside of a high school; but before he was forty\x02six years of age, four colleges had honored him with degrees and he\nhad become chairman of the Democratic National Committee and\nPostmaster General of the United States.\nI once interviewed Jim Farley and asked him the secret of his\nsuccess. He said, \u201cHard work,\u201d and I said, \u201cDon\u2019t be funny.\u201d\nHe then asked me what I thought was the reason for his success. I\nreplied: \u201cI understand you can call ten thousand people by their first\nnames.\u201d\n\u201cNo. You are wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cI can call fifty thousand people by\ntheir first names.\u201d\nMake no mistake about it. That ability helped Mr. Farley put\nFranklin D. Roosevelt in the White House when he managed\nRoosevelt\u2019s campaign in 1932.\nDuring the years that Jim Farley traveled as a salesman for a\ngypsum concern, and during the years that he held office as town\nclerk in Stony Point, he built up a system for remembering names.\nIn the beginning, it was a very simple one. Whenever he met a new\nacquaintance, he found out his or her complete name and some\nfacts about his or her family, business and political opinions. He fixed\nall these facts well in mind as part of the picture, and the next time\nhe met that person, even if it was a year later, he was able to shake\nhands, inquire after the family, and ask about the hollyhocks in the\nbackyard. No wonder he developed a following!\nFor months before Roosevelt\u2019s campaign for President began, Jim\nFarley wrote hundreds of letters a day to people all over the western\nand northwestern states. Then he hopped onto a train and in\nnineteen days covered twenty states and twelve thousand miles,\ntraveling by buggy, train, automobile and boat. He would drop into\ntown, meet his people at lunch or breakfast, tea or dinner, and give\nthem a \u201cheart-to-heart talk.\u201d Then he\u2019d dash off again on another leg\nof his journey.\nAs soon as he arrived back East, he wrote to one person in each\ntown he had visited, asking for a list of all the guests to whom he had\ntalked. The final list contained thousands and thousands of names;\nyet each person on that list was paid the subtle flattery of getting a\npersonal letter from James Farley. These letters began \u201cDear Bill\u201d or\n\u201cDear Jane,\u201d and they were always signed \u201cJim.\u201d\nJim Farley discovered early in life that the average person is more\ninterested in his or her own name than in all the other names on\nearth put together. Remember that name and call it easily, and you\nhave paid a subtle and very effective compliment. But forget it or\nmisspell it\u2014and you have placed yourself at a sharp disadvantage.\nFor example, I once organized a public-speaking course in Paris and\nsent form letters to all the American residents in the city. French\ntypists with apparently little knowledge of English filled in the names\nand naturally they made blunders. One man, the manager of a large\nAmerican bank in Paris, wrote me a scathing rebuke because his\nname had been misspelled.\nSometimes it is difficult to remember a name, particularly if it is\nhard to pronounce. Rather than even try to learn it, many people\nignore it or call the person by an easy nickname. Sid Levy called on\na customer for some time whose name was Nicodemus Papadoulos.\nMost people just called him \u201cNick.\u201d Levy told us: \u201cI made a special\neffort to say his name over several times to myself before I made my\ncall. When I greeted him by his full name: \u2018Good afternoon, Mr.\nNicodemus Papadoulos,\u2019 he was shocked. For what seemed like\nseveral minutes there was no reply from him at all. Finally, he said\nwith tears rolling down his cheeks, \u2018Mr. Levy, in all the fifteen years I\nhave been in this country, nobody has ever made the effort to call\nme by my right name.\u2019\u201d\nWhat was the reason for Andrew Carnegie\u2019s success?\nHe was called the Steel King; yet he himself knew little about the\nmanufacture of steel. He had hundreds of people working for him\nwho knew far more about steel than he did.\nBut he knew how to handle people, and that is what made him rich.\nEarly in life, he showed a flair for organization, a genius for\nleadership. By the time he was ten, he too had discovered the\nastounding importance people place on their own name. And he\nused that discovery to win cooperation. To illustrate: When he was a\nboy back in Scotland, he got hold of a rabbit, a mother rabbit. Presto!\nHe soon had a whole nest of little rabbits\u2014and nothing to feed them.\nBut he had a brilliant idea. He told the boys and girls in the\nneighborhood that if they would go out and pull enough clover and\ndandelions to feed the rabbits, he would name the bunnies in their\nhonor.\nThe plan worked like magic, and Carnegie never forgot it.\nYears later, he made millions by using the same psychology in\nbusiness. For example, he wanted to sell steel rails to the\nPennsylvania Railroad. J. Edgar Thomson was the president of the\nPennsylvania Railroad then. So Andrew Carnegie built a huge steel\nmill in Pittsburgh and called it the \u201cEdgar Thomson Steel Works.\u201d\nHere is a riddle. See if you can guess it. When the Pennsylvania\nRailroad needed steel rails, where do you suppose J. Edgar\nThomson bought them? . . . From Sears, Roebuck? No. No. You\u2019re\nwrong. Guess again.\nWhen Carnegie and George Pullman were battling each other for\nsupremacy in the railroad sleeping-car business, the Steel King\nagain remembered the lesson of the rabbits.\nThe Central Transportation Company, which Andrew Carnegie\ncontrolled, was fighting with the company that Pullman owned. Both\nwere struggling to get the sleeping-car business of the Union Pacific\nRailroad, bucking each other, slashing prices, and destroying all\nchance of profit. Both Carnegie and Pullman had gone to New York\nto see the board of directors of the Union Pacific. Meeting one\nevening in the St. Nicholas Hotel, Carnegie said: \u201cGood evening, Mr.\nPullman, aren\u2019t we making a couple of fools of ourselves?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Pullman demanded.\nThen Carnegie expressed what he had on his mind\u2014a merger of\ntheir two interests. He pictured in glowing terms the mutual\nadvantages of working with, instead of against, each other. Pullman\nlistened attentively, but he was not wholly convinced. Finally he\nasked, \u201cWhat would you call the new company?\u201d and Carnegie\nreplied promptly: \u201cWhy, the Pullman Palace Car Company, of\ncourse.\u201d\nPullman\u2019s face brightened. \u201cCome into my room,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s\ntalk it over.\u201d That talk made industrial history.\nThis policy of remembering and honoring the names of his friends\nand business associates was one of the secrets of Andrew\nCarnegie\u2019s leadership. He was proud of the fact that he could call\nmany of his factory workers by their first names, and he boasted that\nwhile he was personally in charge, no strike ever disturbed his\nflaming steel mills.\nBenton Love, chairman of Texas Commerce Bancshares, believes\nthat the bigger a corporation gets, the colder it becomes. \u201cOne way\nto warm it up,\u201d he said, \u201cis to remember people\u2019s names. The\nexecutive who tells me he can\u2019t remember names is at the same\ntime telling me he can\u2019t remember a significant part of his business\nand is operating on quicksand.\u201d\nKaren Kirsch of Rancho Palos Verdes, California, a flight attendant\nfor TWA, made it a practice to learn the names of as many\npassengers in her cabin as possible and use the name when serving\nthem. This resulted in many compliments on her service expressed\nboth to her directly and to the airline. One passenger wrote: \u201cI\nhaven\u2019t flown TWA for some time, but I\u2019m going to start flying nothing\nbut TWA from now on. You make me feel that your airline has\nbecome a very personalized airline and that is important to me.\u201d\nPeople are so proud of their names that they strive to perpetuate\nthem at any cost. Even blustering, hardboiled old P. T. Barnum, the\ngreatest showman of his time, disappointed because he had no sons\nto carry on his name, offered his grandson, C. H. Seeley, $25,000 if\nhe would call himself \u201cBarnum\u201d Seeley.\nFor many centuries, nobles and magnates supported artists,\nmusicians and authors so that their creative works would be\ndedicated to them.\nLibraries and museums owe their richest collections to people who\ncannot bear to think that their names might perish from the memory\nof the race. The New York Public Library has its Astor and Lenox\ncollections. The Metropolitan Museum perpetuates the names of\nBenjamin Altman and J. P. Morgan. And nearly every church is\nbeautified by stained-glass windows commemorating the names of\ntheir donors. Many of the buildings on the campus of most\nuniversities bear the names of donors who contributed large sums of\nmoney for this honor.\nMost people don\u2019t remember names, for the simple reason that\nthey don\u2019t take the time and energy necessary to concentrate and\nrepeat and fix names indelibly in their minds. They make excuses for\nthemselves; they are too busy.\nBut they were probably no busier than Franklin D. Roosevelt, and\nhe took time to remember and recall even the names of mechanics\nwith whom he came into contact.\nTo illustrate: The Chrysler organization built a special car for Mr.\nRoosevelt, who could not use a standard car because his legs were\nparalyzed. W. F. Chamberlain and a mechanic delivered it to the\nWhite House. I have in front of me a letter from Mr. Chamberlain\nrelating his experiences. \u201cI taught President Roosevelt how to handle\na car with a lot of unusual gadgets, but he taught me a lot about the\nfine art of handling people.\n\u201cWhen I called at the White House,\u201d Mr. Chamberlain writes, \u201cthe\nPresident was extremely pleasant and cheerful. He called me by\nname, made me feel very comfortable, and particularly impressed\nme with the fact that he was vitally interested in things I had to show\nhim and tell him. The car was so designed that it could be operated\nentirely by hand. A crowd gathered around to look at the car; and he\nremarked: \u2018I think it is marvelous. All you have to do is to touch a\nbutton and it moves away and you can drive it without effort. I think it\nis grand\u2014I don\u2019t know what makes it go. I\u2019d love to have the time to\ntear it down and see how it works.\u2019\n\u201cWhen Roosevelt\u2019s friends and associates admired the machine,\nhe said in their presence: \u2018Mr. Chamberlain, I certainly appreciate all\nthe time and effort you have spent in developing this car. It is a\nmighty fine job.\u2019 He admired the radiator, the special rear-vision\nmirror and clock, the special spotlight, the kind of upholstery, the\nsitting position of the driver\u2019s seat, the special suitcases in the trunk\nwith his monogram on each suitcase. In other words, he took notice\nof every detail to which he knew I had given considerable thought.\nHe made a point of bringing these various pieces of equipment to the\nattention of Mrs. Roosevelt, Miss Perkins, the Secretary of Labor,\nand his secretary. He even brought the old White House porter into\nthe picture by saying, \u2018George, you want to take particularly good\ncare of the suitcases.\u2019\n\u201cWhen the driving lesson was finished, the President turned to me\nand said: \u2018Well, Mr. Chamberlain, I have been keeping the Federal\nReserve Board waiting thirty minutes. I guess I had better get back\nto work.\u2019\n\u201cI took a mechanic with me to the White House. He was introduced\nto Roosevelt when he arrived. He didn\u2019t talk to the President, and\nRoosevelt heard his name only once. He was a shy chap, and he\nkept in the background. But before leaving us, the President looked\nfor the mechanic, shook his hand, called him by name, and thanked\nhim for coming to Washington. And there was nothing perfunctory\nabout his thanks. He meant what he said. I could feel that.\n\u201cA few days after returning to New York, I got an autographed\nphotograph of President Roosevelt and a little note of thanks again\nexpressing his appreciation for my assistance. How he found time to\ndo it is a mystery to me.\u201d\nFranklin D. Roosevelt knew that one of the simplest, most obvious\nand most important ways of gaining good will was by remembering\nnames and making people feel important\u2014yet how many of us do it?\nHalf the time we are introduced to a stranger, we chat a few\nminutes and can\u2019t even remember his or her name by the time we\nsay goodbye.\nOne of the first lessons a politician learns is this: \u201cTo recall a voter\u2019s\nname is statesmanship. To forget it is oblivion.\u201d\nAnd the ability to remember names is almost as important in\nbusiness and social contacts as it is in politics.\nNapoleon the Third, Emperor of France and nephew of the great\nNapoleon, boasted that in spite of all his royal duties he could\nremember the name of every person he met.\nHis technique? Simple. If he didn\u2019t hear the name distinctly, he\nsaid, \u201cSo sorry. I didn\u2019t get the name clearly.\u201d Then, if it was an\nunusual name, he would say, \u201cHow is it spelled?\u201d\nDuring the conversation, he took the trouble to repeat the name\nseveral times, and tried to associate it in his mind with the person\u2019s\nfeatures, expression and general appearance.\nIf the person was someone of importance, Napoleon went to even\nfurther pains. As soon as His Royal Highness was alone, he wrote\nthe name down on a piece of paper, looked at it, concentrated on it,\nfixed it securely in his mind, and then tore up the paper. In this way,\nhe gained an eye impression of the name as well as an ear\nimpression.\nAll this takes time, but \u201cGood manners,\u201d said Emerson, \u201care made\nup of petty sacrifices.\u201d\nThe importance of remembering and using names is not just the\nprerogative of kings and corporate executives. It works for all of us.\nKen Nottingham, an employee of General Motors in Indiana, usually\nhad lunch at the company cafeteria. He noticed that the woman who\nworked behind the counter always had a scowl on her face. \u201cShe\nhad been making sandwiches for about two hours and I was just\nanother sandwich to her. I told her what I wanted. She weighed out\nthe ham on a little scale, then she gave me one leaf of lettuce, a few\npotato chips and handed them to me.\n\u201cThe next day I went through the same line. Same woman, same\nscowl. The only difference was I noticed her name tag. I smiled and\nsaid, \u2018Hello, Eunice,\u2019 and then told her what I wanted. Well, she\nforgot the scale, piled on the ham, gave me three leaves of lettuce\nand heaped on the potato chips until they fell off the plate.\u201d\nWe should be aware of the magic contained in a name and realize\nthat this single item is wholly and completely owned by the person\nwith whom we are dealing . . . and nobody else. The name sets the\nindividual apart; it makes him or her unique among all others. The\ninformation we are imparting or the request we are making takes on\na special importance when we approach the situation with the name\nof the individual. From the waitress to the senior executive, the name\nwill work magic as we deal with others.\nPRINCIPLE 3\nRemember that a person\u2019s name is to that\nperson the sweetest and most important\nsound in any language.\n4\nAn Easy Way to Become a Good\nConversationalist\nSome time ago, I attended a bridge party. I don\u2019t play bridge\u2014and\nthere was a woman there who didn\u2019t play bridge either. She had\ndiscovered that I had once been Lowell Thomas\u2019 manager before he\nwent on the radio and that I had traveled in Europe a great deal\nwhile helping him prepare the illustrated travel talks he was then\ndelivering. So she said: \u201cOh, Mr. Carnegie, I do want you to tell me\nabout all the wonderful places you have visited and the sights you\nhave seen.\u201d\nAs we sat down on the sofa, she remarked that she and her\nhusband had recently returned from a trip to Africa. \u201cAfrica!\u201d I\nexclaimed. \u201cHow interesting! I\u2019ve always wanted to see Africa, but I\nnever got there except for a twenty-four-hour stay once in Algiers.\nTell me, did you visit the big-game country? Yes? How fortunate. I\nenvy you. Do tell me about Africa.\u201d\nThat kept her talking for forty-five minutes. She never again asked\nme where I had been or what I had seen. She didn\u2019t want to hear me\ntalk about my travels. All she wanted was an interested listener, so\nshe could expand her ego and tell about where she had been.\nWas she unusual? No. Many people are like that.\nFor example, I met a distinguished botanist at a dinner party given\nby a New York book publisher. I had never talked with a botanist\nbefore, and I found him fascinating. I literally sat on the edge of my\nchair and listened while he spoke of exotic plants and experiments in\ndeveloping new forms of plant life and indoor gardens (and even told\nme astonishing facts about the humble potato). I had a small indoor\ngarden of my own\u2014and he was good enough to tell me how to solve\nsome of my problems.\nAs I said, we were at a dinner party. There must have been a\ndozen other guests, but I violated all the canons of courtesy, ignored\neveryone else, and talked for hours to the botanist.\nMidnight came. I said good night to everyone and departed. The\nbotanist then turned to our host and paid me several flattering\ncompliments. I was \u201cmost stimulating.\u201d I was this and I was that, and\nhe ended by saying I was a \u201cmost interesting conversationalist.\u201d\nAn interesting conversationalist? Why, I had said hardly anything at\nall. I couldn\u2019t have said anything if I had wanted to without changing\nthe subject, for I didn\u2019t know any more about botany than I knew\nabout the anatomy of a penguin. But I had done this: I had listened\nintently. I had listened because I was genuinely interested. And he\nfelt it. Naturally that pleased him. That kind of listening is one of the\nhighest compliments we can pay anyone. \u201cFew human beings,\u201d\nwrote Jack Woodford in Strangers in Love, \u201cfew human beings are\nproof against the implied flattery of rapt attention.\u201d I went even\nfurther than giving him rapt attention. I was \u201chearty in my approbation\nand lavish in my praise.\u201d\nI told him that I had been immensely entertained and instructed\u2014\nand I had. I told him I wished I had his knowledge\u2014and I did. I told\nhim that I should love to wander the fields with him\u2014and I have. I\ntold him I must see him again\u2014and I did.\nAnd so I had him thinking of me as a good conversationalist when,\nin reality, I had been merely a good listener and had encouraged him\nto talk.\nWhat is the secret, the mystery, of a successful business\ninterview? Well, according to former Harvard president Charles W.\nEliot, \u201cThere is no mystery about successful business intercourse. . .\n. Exclusive attention to the person who is speaking to you is very\nimportant. Nothing else is so flattering as that.\u201d\nEliot himself was a past master of the art of listening. Henry\nJames, one of America\u2019s first great novelists, recalled: \u201cDr. Eliot\u2019s\nlistening was not mere silence, but a form of activity. Sitting very\nerect on the end of his spine with hands joined in his lap, making no\nmovement except that he revolved his thumbs around each other\nfaster or slower, he faced his interlocutor and seemed to be hearing\nwith his eyes as well as his ears. He listened with his mind and\nattentively considered what you had to say while you said it. . . . At\nthe end of an interview the person who had talked to him felt that he\nhad had his say.\u201d\nSelf-evident, isn\u2019t it? You don\u2019t have to study for four years in\nHarvard to discover that. Yet I know and you know department store\nowners who will rent expensive space, buy their goods economically,\ndress their windows appealingly, spend thousands of dollars in\nadvertising and then hire clerks who haven\u2019t the sense to be good\nlisteners\u2014clerks who interrupt customers, contradict them, irritate\nthem, and all but drive them from the store.\nA department store in Chicago almost lost a regular customer who\nspent several thousand dollars each year in that store because a\nsales clerk wouldn\u2019t listen. Mrs. Henrietta Douglas, who took our\ncourse in Chicago, had purchased a coat at a special sale. After she\nhad brought it home she noticed that there was a tear in the lining.\nShe came back the next day and asked the sales clerk to exchange\nit. The clerk refused even to listen to her complaint. \u201cYou bought this\nat a special sale,\u201d she said. She pointed to a sign on the wall. \u201cRead\nthat,\u201d she exclaimed. \u201c\u2018All sales are final.\u2019 Once you bought it, you\nhave to keep it. Sew up the lining yourself.\u201d\n\u201cBut this was damaged merchandise,\u201d Mrs. Douglas complained.\n\u201cMakes no difference,\u201d the clerk interrupted. \u201cFinal\u2019s final.\u201d\nMrs. Douglas was about to walk out indignantly, swearing never to\nreturn to that store ever, when she was greeted by the department\nmanager, who knew her from her many years of patronage. Mrs.\nDouglas told her what had happened.\nThe manager listened attentively to the whole story, examined the\ncoat and then said: \u201cSpecial sales are \u2018final\u2019 so we can dispose of\nmerchandise at the end of the season. But this \u2018no return\u2019 policy\ndoes not apply to damaged goods. We will certainly repair or replace\nthe lining, or if you prefer, give you your money back.\u201d\nWhat a difference in treatment! If that manager had not come along\nand listened to the customer, a long-term patron of that store could\nhave been lost forever.\nListening is just as important in one\u2019s home life as in the world of\nbusiness. Millie Esposito of Croton-on-Hudson, New York, made it\nher business to listen carefully when one of her children wanted to\nspeak with her. One evening she was sitting in the kitchen with her\nson, Robert, and after a brief discussion of something that was on\nhis mind, Robert said: \u201cMom, I know that you love me very much.\u201d\nMrs. Esposito was touched and said: \u201cOf course I love you very\nmuch. Did you doubt it?\u201d\nRobert responded: \u201cNo, but I really know you love me because\nwhenever I want to talk to you about something you stop whatever\nyou are doing and listen to me.\u201d\nThe chronic kicker, even the most violent critic, will frequently\nsoften and be subdued in the presence of a patient, sympathetic\nlistener\u2014a listener who will be silent while the irate fault-finder\ndilates like a king cobra and spews the poison out of his system. To\nillustrate: The New York Telephone Company discovered a few years\nago that it had to deal with one of the most vicious customers who\never cursed a customer service representative. And he did curse. He\nraved. He threatened to tear the phone out by its roots. He refused\nto pay certain charges that he declared were false. He wrote letters\nto the newspapers. He filed innumerable complaints with the Public\nService Commission, and he started several suits against the\ntelephone company.\nAt last, one of the company\u2019s most skillful \u201ctroubleshooters\u201d was\nsent to interview this stormy petrel. This \u201ctroubleshooter\u201d listened\nand let the cantankerous customer enjoy himself pouring out his\ntirade. The telephone representative listened and said \u201cyes\u201d and\nsympathized with his grievance.\n\u201cHe raved on and I listened for nearly three hours,\u201d the\n\u201ctroubleshooter\u201d said as he related his experiences before one of the\nauthor\u2019s classes. \u201cThen I went back and listened some more. I\ninterviewed him four times, and before the fourth visit was over I had\nbecome a charter member of an organization he was starting. He\ncalled it the \u2018Telephone Subscribers\u2019 Protective Association.\u2019 I am still\na member of this organization, and, so far as I now, I\u2019m the only\nmember in the world today besides Mr. \u2014\u2014.\n\u201cI listened and sympathized with him on every point that he made\nduring these interviews. He had never had a telephone\nrepresentative talk with him that way before, and he became almost\nfriendly. The point on which I went to see him was not even\nmentioned on the first visit, nor was it mentioned on the second or\nthird, but upon the fourth interview, I closed the case completely, he\npaid all his bills in full, and for the first time in the history of his\ndifficulties with the telephone company he voluntarily withdrew his\ncomplaints from the Public Service Commission.\u201d\nDoubtless Mr. \u2014\u2014 had considered himself a holy crusader,\ndefending the public rights against callous exploitation. But in reality,\nwhat he had really wanted was a feeling of importance. He got this\nfeeling of importance at first by kicking and complaining. But as soon\nas he got his feeling of importance from a representative of the\ncompany, his imagined grievances vanished into thin air.\nOne morning years ago, an angry customer stormed into the office\nof Julian F. Detmer, founder of the Detmer Woolen Company, which\nlater became the world\u2019s largest distributor of woolens to the tailoring\ntrade.\n\u201cThis man owed us a small sum of money,\u201d Mr. Detmer explained\nto me. \u201cThe customer denied it, but we knew he was wrong. So our\ncredit department had insisted that he pay. After getting a number of\nletters from our credit department, he packed his grip, made a trip to\nChicago, and hurried into my office to inform me not only that he was\nnot going to pay that bill, but that he was never going to buy another\ndollar\u2019s worth of goods from the Detmer Woolen Company.\n\u201cI listened patiently to all he had to say. I was tempted to interrupt,\nbut I realized that would be bad policy. So I let him talk himself out.\nWhen he finally simmered down and got in a receptive mood, I said\nquietly: \u2018I want to thank you for coming to Chicago to tell me about\nthis. You have done me a great favor, for if our credit department has\nannoyed you, it may annoy other good customers, and that would be\njust too bad. Believe me, I am far more eager to hear this than you\nare to tell it.\u2019\n\u201cThat was the last thing in the world he expected me to say. I think\nhe was a trifle disappointed, because he had come to Chicago to tell\nme a thing or two, but here I was thanking him instead of scrapping\nwith him. I assured him we would wipe the charge off the books and\nforget it, because he was a very careful man with only one account\nto look after, while our clerks had to look after thousands. Therefore,\nhe was less likely to be wrong than we were.\n\u201cI told him that I understood exactly how he felt and that, if I were in\nhis shoes, I should undoubtedly feel precisely as he did. Since he\nwasn\u2019t going to buy from us anymore, I recommended some other\nwoolen houses.\n\u201cIn the past, we had usually lunched together when he came to\nChicago, so I invited him to have lunch with me this day. He\naccepted reluctantly, but when we came back to the office he placed\na larger order than ever before. He returned home in a softened\nmood and, wanting to be just as fair with us as we had been with\nhim, looked over his bills, found one that had been mislaid, and sent\nus a check with his apologies.\n\u201cLater, when his wife presented him with a baby boy, he gave his\nson the middle name of Detmer, and he remained a friend and\ncustomer of the house until his death twenty-two years afterwards.\u201d\nYears ago, a poor Dutch immigrant boy washed the windows of a\nbakery shop after school to help support his family. His people were\nso poor that in addition he used to go out in the street with a basket\nevery day and collect stray bits of coal that had fallen in the gutter\nwhere the coal wagons had delivered fuel. That boy, Edward Bok,\nnever got more than six years of schooling in his life; yet eventually\nhe made himself one of the most successful magazine editors in the\nhistory of American journalism. How did he do it? That is a long\nstory, but how he got his start can be told briefly. He got his start by\nusing the principles advocated in this chapter.\nHe left school when he was thirteen and became an office boy for\nWestern Union, but he didn\u2019t for one moment give up the idea of an\neducation. Instead, he started to educate himself. He saved his\ncarfares and went without lunch until he had enough money to buy\nan encyclopedia of American biography\u2014and then he did an\nunheard-of thing. He read the lives of famous people and wrote them\nasking for additional information about their childhoods. He was a\ngood listener. He asked famous people to tell him more about\nthemselves. He wrote General James A. Garfield, who was then\nrunning for President, and asked if it was true that he was once a\ntow boy on a canal; and Garfield replied. He wrote General Grant\nasking about a certain battle, and Grant drew a map for him and\ninvited this fourteen-year-old boy to dinner and spent the evening\ntalking to him.\nSoon our Western Union messenger boy was corresponding with\nmany of the most famous people in the nation: Ralph Waldo\nEmerson, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Longfellow, Mrs. Abraham\nLincoln, Louisa May Alcott, General Sherman and Jefferson Davis.\nNot only did he correspond with these distinguished people, but as\nsoon as he got a vacation, he visited many of them as a welcome\nguest in their homes. This experience imbued him with a confidence\nthat was invaluable. These men and women fired him with a vision\nand ambition that shaped his life. And all this, let me repeat, was\nmade possible solely by the application of the principles we are\ndiscussing here.\nIsaac F. Marcosson, a journalist who interviewed hundreds of\ncelebrities, declared that many people fail to make a favorable\nimpression because they don\u2019t listen attentively. \u201cThey have been so\nmuch concerned with what they are going to say next that they do\nnot keep their ears open. . . . Very important people have told me\nthat they prefer good listeners to good talkers, but the ability to listen\nseems rarer than almost any other good trait.\u201d\nAnd not only important personages crave a good listener, but\nordinary folk do too. As the Reader\u2019s Digest once said: \u201cMany\npersons call a doctor when all they want is an audience.\u201d\nDuring the darkest hours of the Civil War, Lincoln wrote to an old\nfriend in Springfield, Illinois, asking him to come to Washington.\nLincoln said he had some problems he wanted to discuss with him.\nThe old neighbor called at the White House, and Lincoln talked to\nhim for hours about the advisability of issuing a proclamation freeing\nthe slaves. Lincoln went over all the arguments for and against such\na move, and then read letters and newspaper articles, some\ndenouncing him for not freeing the slaves and others denouncing\nhim for fear he was going to free them. After talking for hours,\nLincoln shook hands with his old neighbor, said good night, and sent\nhim back to Illinois without even asking for his opinion. Lincoln had\ndone all the talking himself. That seemed to clarify his mind. \u201cHe\nseemed to feel easier after that talk,\u201d the old friend said. Lincoln\nhadn\u2019t wanted advice. He had wanted merely a friendly, sympathetic\nlistener to whom he could unburden himself. That\u2019s what we all want\nwhen we are in trouble. That is frequently all the irritated customer\nwants, and the dissatisfied employee or the hurt friend.\nOne of the great listeners of modern times was Sigmund Freud. A\nman who met Freud described his manner of listening: \u201cIt struck me\nso forcibly that I shall never forget him. He had qualities which I had\nnever seen in any other man. Never had I seen such concentrated\nattention. There was none of that piercing \u2018soul penetrating gaze\u2019\nbusiness. His eyes were mild and genial. His voice was low and\nkind. His gestures were few. But the attention he gave me, his\nappreciation of what I said, even when I said it badly, was\nextraordinary. You\u2019ve no idea what it meant to be listened to like\nthat.\u201d\nIf you want to know how to make people shun you and laugh at\nyou behind your back and even despise you, here is the recipe:\nNever listen to anyone for long. Talk incessantly about yourself. If\nyou have an idea while the other person is talking, don\u2019t wait for him\nor her to finish: bust right in and interrupt in the middle of a sentence.\nDo you know people like that? I do, unfortunately; and the\nastonishing part of it is that some of them are prominent.\nBores, that is all they are\u2014bores intoxicated with their own egos,\ndrunk with a sense of their own importance.\nPeople who talk only of themselves think only of themselves. And\n\u201cthose people who think only of themselves,\u201d Dr. Nicholas Murray\nButler, longtime president of Columbia University, said, \u201care\nhopelessly uneducated. They are not educated,\u201d said Dr. Butler, \u201cno\nmatter how instructed they may be.\u201d\nSo if you aspire to be a good conversationalist, be an attentive\nlistener. To be interesting, be interested. Ask questions that other\npersons will enjoy answering. Encourage them to talk about\nthemselves and their accomplishments.\nRemember that the people you are talking to are a hundred times\nmore interested in themselves and their wants and problems than\nthey are in you and your problems. A person\u2019s toothache means\nmore to that person than a famine in China which kills a million\npeople. A boil on one\u2019s neck interests one more than forty\nearthquakes in Africa. Think of that the next time you start a\nconversation.\nPRINCIPLE 4\nBe a good listener. Encourage others to talk\nabout themselves.\n5\nHow to Interest People\nEveryone who was ever a guest of Theodore Roosevelt was\nastonished at the range and diversity of his knowledge. Whether his\nvisitor was a cowboy or a Rough Rider, a New York politician or a\ndiplomat, Roosevelt knew what to say. And how was it done? The\nanswer was simple. Whenever Roosevelt expected a visitor, he sat\nup late the night before, reading up on the subject in which he knew\nhis guest was particularly interested.\nFor Roosevelt knew, as all leaders know, that the royal road to a\nperson\u2019s heart is to talk about the things he or she treasures most.\nThe genial William Lyon Phelps, essayist and professor of literature\nat Yale, learned this lesson early in life.\n\u201cWhen I was eight years old and was spending a weekend visiting\nmy Aunt Libby Linsley at her home in Stratford on the Housatonic,\u201d\nhe wrote in his essay on Human Nature, \u201ca middle-aged man called\none evening, and after a polite skirmish with my aunt, he devoted his\nattention to me. At that time, I happened to be excited about boats,\nand the visitor discussed the subject in a way that seemed to me\nparticularly interesting. After he left, I spoke of him with enthusiasm.\nWhat a man! My aunt informed me he was a New York lawyer, that\nhe cared nothing whatever about boats\u2014that he took not the\nslightest interest in the subject. \u2018But why then did he talk all the time\nabout boats?\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Because he is a gentleman. He saw you were interested in boats,\nand he talked about the things he knew would interest and please\nyou. He made himself agreeable.\u2019\u201d\nAnd William Lyon Phelps added: \u201cI never forgot my aunt\u2019s remark.\u201d\nAs I write this chapter, I have before me a letter from Edward L.\nChalif, who was active in Boy Scout work.\n\u201cOne day I found I needed a favor,\u201d wrote Mr. Chalif. \u201cA big Scout\njamboree was coming off in Europe, and I wanted the president of\none of the largest corporations in America to pay the expenses of\none of my boys for the trip.\n\u201cFortunately, just before I went to see this man, I heard that he had\ndrawn a check for a million dollars, and that after it was canceled, he\nhad had it framed.\n\u201cSo the first thing I did when I entered his office was to ask to see\nthe check. A check for a million dollars! I told him I never knew that\nanybody had ever written such a check, and that I wanted to tell my\nboys that I had actually seen a check for a million dollars. He gladly\nshowed it to me; I admired it and asked him to tell me all about how\nit happened to be drawn.\u201d\nYou notice, don\u2019t you, that Mr. Chalif didn\u2019t begin by talking about\nthe Boy Scouts, or the jamboree in Europe, or what it was he\nwanted? He talked in terms of what interested the other man. Here\u2019s\nthe result:\n\u201cPresently, the man I was interviewing said: \u2018Oh, by the way, what\nwas it you wanted to see me about?\u2019 So I told him.\n\u201cTo my vast surprise,\u201d Mr. Chalif continues, \u201che not only granted\nimmediately what I asked for, but much more. I had asked him to\nsend only one boy to Europe, but he sent five boys and myself, gave\nme a letter of credit for a thousand dollars and told us to stay in\nEurope for seven weeks. He also gave me letters of introduction to\nhis branch presidents, putting them at our service, and he himself\nmet us in Paris and showed us the town. Since then, he has given\njobs to some of the boys whose parents were in want, and he is still\nactive in our group.\n\u201cYet I know if I hadn\u2019t found out what he was interested in, and got\nhim warmed up first, I wouldn\u2019t have found him one-tenth as easy to\napproach.\u201d\nIs this a valuable technique to use in business? Is it? Let\u2019s see.\nTake Henry G. Duvernoy of Duvernoy and Sons, a wholesale baking\nfirm in New York.\nMr. Duvernoy had been trying to sell bread to a certain New York\nhotel. He had called on the manager every week for four years. He\nwent to the same social affairs the manager attended. He even took\nrooms in the hotel and lived there in order to get the business. But\nhe failed.\n\u201cThen,\u201d said Mr. Duvernoy, \u201cafter studying human relations, I\nresolved to change my tactics. I decided to find out what interested\nthis man\u2014what caught his enthusiasm.\n\u201cI discovered he belonged to a society of hotel executives called\nthe Hotel Greeters of America. He not only belonged, but his\nbubbling enthusiasm had made him president of the organization,\nand president of the International Greeters. No matter where its\nconventions were held, he would be there.\n\u201cSo when I saw him the next day, I began talking about the\nGreeters. What a response I got. What a response! He talked to me\nfor half an hour about the Greeters, his tones vibrant with\nenthusiasm. I could plainly see that this society was not only his\nhobby, it was the passion of his life. Before I left his office, he had\n\u2018sold\u2019 me a membership in his organization.\n\u201cIn the meantime, I had said nothing about bread. But a few days\nlater, the steward of his hotel phoned me to come over with samples\nand prices.\n\u201c\u2018I don\u2019t know what you did to the old boy,\u2019 the steward greeted me,\n\u2018but he sure is sold on you!\u2019\n\u201cThink of it! I had been drumming at that man for four years\u2014trying\nto get his business\u2014and I\u2019d still be drumming at him if I hadn\u2019t finally\ntaken the trouble to find out what he was interested in, and what he\nenjoyed talking about.\u201d\nEdward E. Harriman of Hagerstown, Maryland, chose to live in the\nbeautiful Cumberland Valley of Maryland after he completed his\nmilitary service. Unfortunately, at that time there were few jobs\navailable in the area. A little research uncovered the fact that a\nnumber of companies in the area were either owned or controlled by\nan unusual business maverick, R. J. Funkhouser, whose rise from\npoverty to riches intrigued Mr. Harriman. However, he was known for\nbeing inaccessible to job seekers. Mr. Harriman wrote:\n\u201cI interviewed a number of people and found that his major interest\nwas anchored in his drive for power and money. Since he protected\nhimself from people like me by use of a dedicated and stern\nsecretary, I studied her interests and goals and only then I paid an\nunannounced visit at her office. She had been Mr. Funkhouser\u2019s\norbiting satellite for about fifteen years. When I told her I had a\nproposition for him which might translate itself into financial and\npolitical success for him, she became enthused. I also conversed\nwith her about her constructive participation in his success. After this\nconversation she arranged for me to meet Mr. Funkhouser.\n\u201cI entered his huge and impressive office determined not to ask\ndirectly for a job. He was seated behind a large carved desk and\nthundered at me, \u2018How about it, young man?\u2019 I said, \u2018Mr. Funkhouser,\nI believe I can make money for you.\u2019 He immediately rose and invited\nme to sit in one of the large upholstered chairs. I enumerated my\nideas and the qualifications I had to realize these ideas, as well as\nhow they would contribute to his personal success and that of his\nbusinesses.\n\u201c\u2018R. J.,\u2019 as he became known to me, hired me at once and for over\ntwenty years I have grown in his enterprises and we both have\nprospered.\u201d\nTalking in terms of the other person\u2019s interests pays off for both\nparties. Howard Z. Herzig, a leader in the field of employee\ncommunications, has always followed this principle. When asked\nwhat reward he got from it, Mr. Herzig responded that he not only\nreceived a different reward from each person but that in general the\nreward had been an enlargement of his life each time he spoke to\nsomeone.\nPRINCIPLE 5\nTalk in terms of the other person\u2019s interests.\n6\nHow to Make People Like You Instantly\nI was waiting in line to register a letter in the post office at Thirty-third\nStreet and Eighth Avenue in New York. I noticed that the clerk\nappeared to be bored with the job\u2014weighing envelopes, handing out\nstamps, making change, issuing receipts\u2014the same monotonous\ngrind year after year. So I said to myself: \u201cI am going to try to make\nthat clerk like me. Obviously, to make him like me, I must say\nsomething nice, not about myself, but about him.\u201d So I asked myself,\n\u201cWhat is there about him that I can honestly admire?\u201d That is\nsometimes a hard question to answer, especially with strangers; but,\nin this case, it happened to be easy. I instantly saw something I\nadmired no end.\nSo while he was weighing my envelope, I remarked with\nenthusiasm: \u201cI certainly wish I had your head of hair.\u201d\nHe looked up, half-startled, his face beaming with smiles. \u201cWell, it\nisn\u2019t as good as it used to be,\u201d he said modestly. I assured him that\nalthough it might have lost some of its pristine glory, nevertheless it\nwas still magnificent. He was immensely pleased. We carried on a\npleasant little conversation and the last thing he said to me was:\n\u201cMany people have admired my hair.\u201d\nI\u2019ll bet that person went out to lunch that day walking on air. I\u2019ll bet\nhe went home that night and told his wife about it. I\u2019ll bet he looked in\nthe mirror and said: \u201cIt is a beautiful head of hair.\u201d\nI told this story once in public and a man asked me afterwards:\n\u201cWhat did you want to get out of him?\u201d\nWhat was I trying to get out of him!!! What was I trying to get out of\nhim!!!\nIf we are so contemptibly selfish that we can\u2019t radiate a little\nhappiness and pass on a bit of honest appreciation without trying to\nget something out of the other person in return\u2014if our souls are no\nbigger than sour crab apples, we shall meet with the failure we so\nrichly deserve.\nOh yes, I did want something out of that chap. I wanted something\npriceless. And I got it. I got the feeling that I had done something for\nhim without his being able to do anything whatever in return for me.\nThat is a feeling that flows and sings in your memory long after the\nincident is past.\nThere is one all-important law of human conduct. If we obey that\nlaw, we shall almost never get into trouble. In fact, that law, if\nobeyed, will bring us countless friends and constant happiness. But\nthe very instant we break the law, we shall get into endless trouble.\nThe law is this: Always make the other person feel important. John\nDewey, as we have already noted, said that the desire to be\nimportant is the deepest urge in human nature; and William James\nsaid: \u201cThe deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be\nappreciated.\u201d As I have already pointed out, it is this urge that\ndifferentiates us from the animals. It is this urge that has been\nresponsible for civilization itself.\nPhilosophers have been speculating on the rules of human\nrelationships for thousands of years, and out of all that speculation,\nthere has evolved only one important precept. It is not new. It is as\nold as history. Zoroaster taught it to his followers in Persia twenty\x02five hundred years ago. Confucius preached it in China twenty-four\ncenturies ago. Lao-tse, the founder of Taoism, taught it to his\ndisciples in the Valley of the Han. Buddha preached it on the bank of\nthe Holy Ganges five hundred years before Christ. The sacred books\nof Hinduism taught it a thousand years before that. Jesus taught it\namong the stony hills of Judea nineteen centuries ago. Jesus\nsummed it up in one thought\u2014probably the most important rule in\nthe world: \u201cDo unto others as you would have others do unto you.\u201d\nYou want the approval of those with whom you come in contact.\nYou want recognition of your true worth. You want a feeling that you\nare important in your little world. You don\u2019t want to listen to cheap,\ninsincere flattery, but you do crave sincere appreciation. You want\nyour friends and associates to be, as Charles Schwab put it, \u201chearty\nin their approbation and lavish in their praise.\u201d All of us want that.\nSo let\u2019s obey the Golden Rule, and give unto others what we would\nhave others give unto us.\nHow? When? Where? The answer is: All the time, everywhere.\nDavid G. Smith of Eau Claire, Wisconsin, told one of our classes\nhow he handled a delicate situation when he was asked to take\ncharge of the refreshment booth at a charity concert.\n\u201cThe night of the concert I arrived at the park and found two elderly\nladies in a very bad humor standing next to the refreshment stand.\nApparently each thought that she was in charge of this project. As I\nstood there pondering what to do, one of the members of the\nsponsoring committee appeared and handed me a cash box and\nthanked me for taking over the project. She introduced Rose and\nJane as my helpers and then ran off.\n\u201cA great silence ensued. Realizing that the cash box was a symbol\nof authority (of sorts), I gave the box to Rose and explained that I\nmight not be able to keep the money straight and that if she took\ncare of it I would feel better. I then suggested to Jane that she show\ntwo teenagers who had been assigned to refreshments how to\noperate the soda machine, and I asked her to be responsible for that\npart of the project.\n\u201cThe evening was very enjoyable with Rose happily counting the\nmoney, Jane supervising the teenagers, and me enjoying the\nconcert.\u201d\nYou don\u2019t have to wait until you are ambassador to France or\nchairman of the Clambake Committee of your lodge before you use\nthis philosophy of appreciation. You can work magic with it almost\nevery day.\nIf, for example, the waitress brings us mashed potatoes when we\nhave ordered French fried, let\u2019s say: \u201cI\u2019m sorry to trouble you, but I\nprefer French fried.\u201d She\u2019ll probably reply, \u201cNo trouble at all\u201d and will\nbe glad to change the potatoes, because we have shown respect for\nher.\nLittle phrases such as \u201cI\u2019m sorry to trouble you,\u201d \u201cWould you be so\nkind as to \u2014\u2014\u2014?\u201d \u201cWon\u2019t you please?\u201d \u201cWould you mind?\u201d \u201cThank\nyou\u201d\u2014little courtesies like these oil the cogs of the monotonous grind\nof everyday life\u2014and, incidentally, they are the hallmark of good\nbreeding.\nLet\u2019s take another illustration, Hall Caine\u2019s novels\u2014The Christian,\nThe Deemster, The Manxman, among them\u2014were all bestsellers in\nthe early part of this century. Millions of people read his novels,\ncountless millions. He was the son of a blacksmith. He never had\nmore than eight years\u2019 schooling in his life; yet when he died he was\nthe richest literary man of his time.\nThe story goes like this: Hall Caine loved sonnets and ballads; so\nhe devoured all of Dante Gabriel Rossetti\u2019s poetry. He even wrote a\nlecture chanting the praises of Rossetti\u2019s artistic achievement\u2014and\nsent a copy to Rossetti himself. Rossetti was delighted. \u201cAny young\nman who has such an exalted opinion of my ability,\u201d Rossetti\nprobably said to himself, \u201cmust be brilliant.\u201d So Rossetti invited this\nblacksmith\u2019s son to come to London and act as his secretary. That\nwas the turning point in Hall Caine\u2019s life; for, in his new position, he\nmet the literary artists of the day. Profiting by their advice and\ninspired by their encouragement, he launched upon a career that\nemblazoned his name across the sky.\nHis home, Greeba Castle, on the Isle of Man, became a Mecca for\ntourists from the far corners of the world, and he left a multimillion\x02dollar estate. Yet\u2014who knows\u2014he might have died poor and\nunknown had he not written an essay expressing his admiration for a\nfamous man.\nSuch is the power, the stupendous power, of sincere, heartfelt\nappreciation.\nRossetti considered himself important. That is not strange. Almost\neveryone considers himself important, very important.\nThe life of many a person could probably be changed if only\nsomeone would make him feel important. Ronald J. Rowland, who is\none of the instructors of our course in California, is also a teacher of\narts and crafts. He wrote to us about a student named Chris in his\nbeginning-crafts class:\nChris was a very quiet, shy boy lacking in self-confidence, the\nkind of student that often does not receive the attention he\ndeserves. I also teach an advanced class that had grown to be\nsomewhat of a status symbol and a privilege for a student to\nhave earned the right to be in it.\nOn Wednesday, Chris was diligently working at his desk. I\nreally felt there was a hidden fire deep inside him. I asked Chris\nif he would like to be in the advanced class. How I wish I could\nexpress the look in Chris\u2019s face, the emotions in that shy\nfourteen-year-old boy trying to hold back his tears.\n\u201cWho me, Mr. Rowland? Am I good enough?\u201d\n\u201cYes, Chris, you are good enough.\u201d\nI had to leave at that point because tears were coming to my\neyes. As Chris walked out of class that day, seemingly two\ninches taller, he looked at me with bright blue eyes and said in a\npositive voice, \u201cThank you, Mr. Rowland.\u201d\nChris taught me a lesson I will never forget\u2014our deep desire\nto feel important. To help me never forget this rule, I made a sign\nwhich reads \u201cyou are important.\u201d This sign hangs in the front of the\nclassroom for all to see and to remind me that each student I\nface is equally important.\nThe unvarnished truth is that almost all the people you meet feel\nthemselves superior to you in some way, and a sure way to their\nhearts is to let them realize in some subtle way that you recognize\ntheir importance, and recognize it sincerely.\nRemember what Emerson said: \u201cEvery man I meet is my superior\nin some way. In that, I learn of him.\u201d\nAnd the pathetic part of it is that frequently those who have the\nleast justification for a feeling of achievement bolster up their egos\nby a show of tumult and conceit which is truly nauseating. As\nShakespeare put it: \u201c. . . man, proud man, / Drest in a little brief\nauthority, / . . . Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven / As\nmake the angels weep.\u201d\nI am going to tell you how business people in my own courses\nhave applied these principles with remarkable results. Let\u2019s take the\ncase of a Connecticut attorney (because of his relatives he prefers\nnot to have his name mentioned).\nShortly after joining the course, Mr. R\u2014\u2014 drove to Long Island\nwith his wife to visit some of her relatives. She left him to chat with\nan old aunt of hers and then rushed off by herself to visit some of the\nyounger relatives. Since he soon had to give a speech professionally\non how he applied the principles of appreciation, he thought he\nwould gain some worthwhile experience talking with the elderly lady.\nSo he looked around the house to see what he could honestly\nadmire.\n\u201cThis house was built about 1890, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d he inquired.\n\u201cYes,\u201d she replied, \u201cthat is precisely the year it was built.\u201d\n\u201cIt reminds me of the house I was born in,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\nWell built. Roomy. You know, they don\u2019t build houses like this\nanymore.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d the old lady agreed. \u201cThe young folks nowadays\ndon\u2019t care for beautiful homes. All they want is a small apartment,\nand then they go off gadding about in their automobiles.\n\u201cThis is a dream house,\u201d she said in a voice vibrating with tender\nmemories. \u201cThis house was built with love. My husband and I\ndreamed about it for years before we built it. We didn\u2019t have an\narchitect. We planned it all ourselves.\u201d\nShe showed Mr. R\u2014\u2014 about the house, and he expressed his\nhearty admiration for the beautiful treasures she had picked up in her\ntravels and cherished over a lifetime\u2014paisley shawls, an old English\ntea set, Wedgwood china, French beds and chairs, Italian paintings,\nand silk draperies that had once hung in a French chateau.\nAfter showing Mr. R\u2014\u2014 through the house, she took him out to the\ngarage. There, jacked up on blocks, was a Packard car\u2014in mint\ncondition.\n\u201cMy husband bought that car for me shortly before he passed on,\u201d\nshe said softly. \u201cI have never ridden in it since his death. . . . You\nappreciate nice things, and I\u2019m going to give this car to you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy, aunty,\u201d he said, \u201cyou overwhelm me. I appreciate your\ngenerosity, of course; but I couldn\u2019t possibly accept it. I\u2019m not even a\nrelative of yours. I have a new car, and you have many relatives that\nwould like to have that Packard.\u201d\n\u201cRelatives!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cYes, I have relatives who are just\nwaiting till I die so they can get that car. But they are not going to get\nit.\u201d\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to give it to them, you can very easily sell it to a\nsecondhand dealer,\u201d he told her.\n\u201cSell it!\u201d she cried. \u201cDo you think I would sell this car? Do you think\nI could stand to see strangers riding up and down the street in that\ncar\u2014that car that my husband bought for me? I wouldn\u2019t dream of\nselling it. I\u2019m going to give it to you. You appreciate beautiful things.\u201d\nHe tried to get out of accepting the car, but he couldn\u2019t without\nhurting her feelings.\nThis lady, left all alone in a big house with her paisley shawls, her\nFrench antiques, and her memories, was starving for a little\nrecognition. She had once been young and beautiful and sought\nafter. She had once built a house warm with love and had collected\nthings from all over Europe to make it beautiful. Now, in the isolated\nloneliness of old age, she craved a little human warmth, a little\ngenuine appreciation\u2014and no one gave it to her. And when she\nfound it, like a spring in the desert, her gratitude couldn\u2019t adequately\nexpress itself with anything less than the gift of her cherished\nPackard.\nLet\u2019s take another case: Donald M. McMahon, who was\nsuperintendent of Lewis and Valentine, nurserymen and landscape\narchitects in Rye, New York, related this incident.\n\u201cShortly after I attended the talk on \u2018How to Win Friends and\nInfluence People,\u2019 I was landscaping the estate of a famous attorney.\nThe owner came out to give me a few instructions about where he\nwished to plant a mass of rhododendrons and azaleas.\n\u201cI said, \u2018Judge, you have a lovely hobby. I\u2019ve been admiring your\nbeautiful dogs. I understand you win a lot of blue ribbons every year\nat the show in Madison Square Garden.\u2019\n\u201cThe effect of this little expression of appreciation was striking.\n\u201c\u2018Yes,\u2019 the judge replied, \u2018I do have a lot of fun with my dogs. Would\nyou like to see my kennel?\u2019\n\u201cHe spent almost an hour showing me his dogs and the prizes they\nhad won. He even brought out their pedigrees and explained about\nthe bloodlines responsible for such beauty and intelligence.\n\u201cFinally, turning to me, he asked: \u2018Do you have any small children?\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Yes, I do,\u2019 I replied, \u2018I have a son.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Well, wouldn\u2019t he like a puppy?\u2019 the judge inquired.\n\u201c\u2018Oh, yes, he\u2019d be tickled pink.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018All right, I\u2019m going to give him one,\u2019 the judge announced.\n\u201cHe started to tell me how to feed the puppy. Then he paused.\n\u2018You\u2019ll forget it if I tell you. I\u2019ll write it out.\u2019 So the judge went in the\nhouse, typed out the pedigree and feeding instructions, and gave me\na puppy worth several hundred dollars and one hour and fifteen\nminutes of his valuable time largely because I had expressed my\nhonest admiration for his hobby and achievements.\u201d\nGeorge Eastman, of Kodak fame, invented the transparent film that\nmade motion pictures possible, amassed a fortune of a hundred\nmillion dollars, and made himself one of the most famous\nbusinessmen on earth. Yet in spite of all these tremendous\naccomplishments, he craved little recognitions even as you and I.\nTo illustrate: When Eastman was building the Eastman School of\nMusic and also Kilbourn Hall in Rochester, James Adamson, then\npresident of the Superior Seating Company of New York, wanted to\nget the order to supply the theater chairs for these buildings.\nPhoning the architect, Mr. Adamson made an appointment to see Mr.\nEastman in Rochester.\nWhen Adamson arrived, the architect said: \u201cI know you want to get\nthis order, but I can tell you right now that you won\u2019t stand a ghost of\na show if you take more than five minutes of George Eastman\u2019s time.\nHe is a strict disciplinarian. He is very busy. So tell your story quickly\nand get out.\u201d\nAdamson was prepared to do just that.\nWhen he was ushered into the room he saw Mr. Eastman bending\nover a pile of papers at his desk. Presently, Mr. Eastman looked up,\nremoved his glasses, and walked toward the architect and Mr.\nAdamson, saying: \u201cGood morning, gentlemen, what can I do for\nyou?\u201d\nThe architect introduced them, and then Mr. Adamson said: \u201cWhile\nwe\u2019ve been waiting for you, Mr. Eastman, I\u2019ve been admiring your\noffice. I wouldn\u2019t mind working in a room like this myself. I\u2019m in the\ninterior-woodworking business, and I never saw a more beautiful\noffice in all my life.\u201d\nGeorge Eastman replied: \u201cYou remind me of something I had\nalmost forgotten. It is beautiful, isn\u2019t it? I enjoyed it a great deal when\nit was first built. But I come down here now with a lot of other things\non my mind and sometimes don\u2019t even see the room for weeks at a\ntime.\u201d\nAdamson walked over and rubbed his hand across a panel. \u201cThis\nis English oak, isn\u2019t it? A little different texture from Italian oak.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Eastman replied. \u201cImported English oak. It was selected for\nme by a friend who specializes in fine woods.\u201d\nThen Eastman showed him about the room, commenting on the\nproportions, the coloring, the hand carving and other effects he had\nhelped to plan and execute.\nWhile drifting about the room, admiring the woodwork, they paused\nbefore a window, and George Eastman, in his modest, soft-spoken\nway, pointed out some of the institutions through which he was trying\nto help humanity: the University of Rochester, the General Hospital,\nthe Homeopathic Hospital, the Friendly Home, the Children\u2019s\nHospital. Mr. Adamson congratulated him warmly on the idealistic\nway he was using his wealth to alleviate the sufferings of humanity.\nPresently, George Eastman unlocked a glass case and pulled out\nthe first camera he had ever owned\u2014an invention he had bought\nfrom an Englishman.\nAdamson questioned him at length about his early struggles to get\nstarted in business, and Mr. Eastman spoke with real feeling about\nthe poverty of his childhood, telling how his widowed mother had\nkept a boardinghouse while he clerked in an insurance office. The\nterror of poverty haunted him day and night, and he resolved to\nmake enough money so that his mother wouldn\u2019t have to work. Mr.\nAdamson drew him out with further questions and listened,\nabsorbed, while he related the story of his experiments with dry\nphotographic plates. He told how he had worked in an office all day,\nand sometimes experimented all night, taking only brief naps while\nthe chemicals were working, sometimes working and sleeping in his\nclothes for seventy-two hours at a stretch.\nJames Adamson had been ushered into Eastman\u2019s office at ten\x02fifteen and had been warned that he must not take more than five\nminutes; but an hour had passed, then two hours passed. And they\nwere still talking.\nFinally, George Eastman turned to Adamson and said, \u201cThe last\ntime I was in Japan I bought some chairs, brought them home, and\nput them in my sun porch. But the sun peeled the paint, so I went\ndowntown the other day and bought some paint and painted the\nchairs myself. Would you like to see what sort of a job I can do\npainting chairs? All right. Come up to my home and have lunch with\nme and I\u2019ll show you.\u201d\nAfter lunch, Mr. Eastman showed Adamson the chairs he had\nbrought from Japan. They weren\u2019t worth more than a few dollars, but\nGeorge Eastman, now a multimillionaire, was proud of them because\nhe himself had painted them.\nThe order for the seats amounted to $90,000. Who do you\nsuppose got the order\u2014James Adamson or one of his competitors?\nFrom the time of this story until Mr. Eastman\u2019s death, he and\nJames Adamson were close friends.\nClaude Marais, a restaurant owner in Rouen, France, used this\nprinciple and saved his restaurant the loss of a key employee. This\nwoman had been in his employ for five years and was a vital link\nbetween M. Marais and his staff of twenty-one people. He was\nshocked to receive a registered letter from her advising him of her\nresignation.\nM. Marais reported: \u201cI was very surprised and, even more,\ndisappointed, because I was under the impression that I had been\nfair to her and receptive to her needs. Inasmuch as she was a friend\nas well as an employee, I probably had taken her too much for\ngranted and maybe was even more demanding of her than of other\nemployees.\n\u201cI could not, of course, accept this resignation without some\nexplanation. I took her aside and said, \u2018Paulette, you must\nunderstand that I cannot accept your resignation. You mean a great\ndeal to me and to this company, and you are as important to the\nsuccess of this restaurant as I am.\u2019 I repeated this in front of the\nentire staff, and I invited her to my home and reiterated my\nconfidence in her with my family present.\n\u201cPaulette withdrew her resignation, and today I can rely on her as\nnever before. I frequently reinforce this by expressing my\nappreciation for what she does and showing her how important she\nis to me and to the restaurant.\u201d\n\u201cTalk to people about themselves,\u201d said Disraeli, one of the\nshrewdest men who ever ruled the British Empire, and they will listen\nfor hours.\u201d\nPRINCIPLE 6\nMake the other person feel important\u2014and do\nit sincerely.\nIN A NUTSHELL\nSIX WAYS TO MAKE PEOPLE LIKE YOU\nPRINCIPLE 1\nBecome genuinely interested in other people.\nPRINCIPLE 2\nSmile.\nPRINCIPLE 3\nRemember that a person\u2019s name is to that person the\nsweetest and most important sound in any language.\nPRINCIPLE 4\nBe a good listener.

I was manager at the time for Sir Ross Smith.\nDuring the war, Sir Ross had been the Australian ace out in\nPalestine; and shortly after peace was declared, he astonished the\nworld by flying halfway around it in thirty days. No such feat had ever\nbeen attempted before. It created a tremendous sensation. The\nAustralian government awarded him fifty thousand dollars; the King\nof England knighted him; and, for a while, he was the most talked\x02about man under the Union Jack. I was attending a banquet one\nnight given in Sir Ross\u2019s honor; and during the dinner, the man sitting\nnext to me told a humorous story which hinged on the quotation\n\u201cThere\u2019s a divinity that shapes our ends, rough-hew them how we\nwill.\u201d\nThe raconteur mentioned that the quotation was from the Bible. He\nwas wrong. I knew that. I knew it positively. There couldn\u2019t be the\nslightest doubt about it. And so, to get a feeling of importance and\ndisplay my superiority, I appointed myself as an unsolicited and\nunwelcome committee of one to correct him. He stuck to his guns.\nWhat? From Shakespeare? Impossible! Absurd! That quotation was\nfrom the Bible. And he knew it.\nThe storyteller was sitting on my right; and Frank Gammond, an\nold friend of mine, was seated at my left. Mr. Gammond had devoted\nyears to the study of Shakespeare. So the storyteller and I agreed to\nsubmit the question to Mr. Gammond. Mr. Gammond listened, kicked\nme under the table, and then said: \u201cDale, you are wrong. The\ngentleman is right. It is from the Bible.\u201d\nOn our way home that night, I said to Mr. Gammond: \u201cFrank, you\nknew that quotation was from Shakespeare.\u201d\n\u201cYes, of course,\u201d he replied, \u201cHamlet, Act Five, Scene Two. But we\nwere guests at a festive occasion, my dear Dale. Why prove to a\nman he is wrong? Is that going to make him like you? Why not let\nhim save his face? He didn\u2019t ask for your opinion. He didn\u2019t want it.\nWhy argue with him? Always avoid the acute angle.\u201d The man who\nsaid that taught me a lesson I\u2019ll never forget. I not only had made the\nstoryteller uncomfortable, but had put my friend in an embarrassing\nsituation. How much better it would have been had I not become\nargumentative.\nIt was a sorely needed lesson because I had been an inveterate\narguer. During my youth, I had argued with my brother about\neverything under the Milky Way. When I went to college, I studied\nlogic and argumentation and went in for debating contests. Talk\nabout being from Missouri, I was born there. I had to be shown.\nLater, I taught debating and argumentation in New York; and once, I\nam ashamed to admit, I planned to write a book on the subject.\nSince then, I have listened to, engaged in, and watched the effect of\nthousands of arguments. As a result of all this, I have come to the\nconclusion that there is only one way under high heaven to get the\nbest of an argument\u2014and that is to avoid it. Avoid it as you would\navoid rattlesnakes and earthquakes.\nNine times out of ten, an argument ends with each of the\ncontestants more firmly convinced than ever that he is absolutely\nright.\nYou can\u2019t win an argument. You can\u2019t because if you lose it, you\nlose it; and if you win it, you lose it. Why? Well, suppose you triumph\nover the other man and shoot his argument full of holes and prove\nthat he is non compos mentis. Then what? You will feel fine. But\nwhat about him? You have made him feel inferior. You have hurt his\npride. He will resent your triumph. And\u2014\nA man convinced against his will\nIs of the same opinion still.\nYears ago Patrick J. O\u2019Haire joined one of my classes. He had had\nlittle education, and how he loved a scrap! He had once been a\nchauffeur, and he came to me because he had been trying, without\nmuch success, to sell trucks. A little questioning brought out the fact\nthat he was continually scrapping with and antagonizing the very\npeople he was trying to do business with. If a prospect said anything\nderogatory about the trucks he was selling, Pat saw red and was\nright at the customer\u2019s throat. Pat won a lot of arguments in those\ndays. As he said to me afterward, \u201cI often walked out of an office\nsaying: \u2018I told that bird something.\u2019 Sure I had told him something,\nbut I hadn\u2019t sold him anything.\u201d\nMy first problem was not to teach Patrick J. O\u2019Haire to talk. My\nimmediate task was to train him to refrain from talking and to avoid\nverbal fights.\nMr. O\u2019Haire became one of the star salesmen for the White Motor\nCompany in New York. How did he do it? Here is his story in his own\nwords: \u201cIf I walk into a buyer\u2019s office now and he says: \u2018What? A\nWhite truck? They\u2019re no good! I wouldn\u2019t take one if you gave it to\nme. I\u2019m going to buy the Whose-It truck,\u2019 I say, \u2018The Whose-It is a\ngood truck. If you buy the Whose-It, you\u2019ll never make a mistake.\nThe Whose-Its are made by a fine company and sold by good\npeople.\u2019\n\u201cHe is speechless then. There is no room for an argument. If he\nsays the Whose-It is best and I say sure it is, he has to stop. He\ncan\u2019t keep on all afternoon saying, \u2018It\u2019s the best\u2019 when I\u2019m agreeing\nwith him. We then get off the subject of Whose-It and I begin to talk\nabout the good points of the White truck.\n\u201cThere was a time when a remark like his first one would have\nmade me see scarlet and red and orange. I would start arguing\nagainst the Whose-It; and the more I argued against it, the more my\nprospect argued in favor of it; and the more he argued, the more he\nsold himself on my competitor\u2019s product.\n\u201cAs I look back now I wonder how I was ever able to sell anything. I\nlost years of my life in scrapping and arguing. I keep my mouth shut\nnow. It pays.\u201d\nAs wise old Ben Franklin used to say:\nIf you argue and rankle and contradict, you may achieve a\nvictory sometimes; but it will be an empty victory because you\nwill never get your opponent\u2019s good will.\nSo figure it out for yourself. Which would you rather have, an\nacademic, theatrical victory or a person\u2019s good will? You can\nseldom have both.\nThe Boston Transcript once printed this bit of significant\ndoggerel:\nHere lies the body of William Jay,\nWho died maintaining his right of way\u2014\nHe was right, dead right, as he sped along,\nBut he\u2019s just as dead as if he were wrong.\nYou may be right, dead right, as you speed along in your\nargument; but as far as changing another\u2019s mind is concerned, you\nwill probably be just as futile as if you were wrong.\nFrederick S. Parsons, an income tax consultant, had been\ndisputing and wrangling for an hour with a government tax inspector.\nAn item of nine thousand dollars was at stake. Mr. Parsons claimed\nthat this nine thousand dollars was in reality a bad debt, that it would\nnever be collected, that it ought not to be taxed. \u201cBad debt, my eye!\u201d\nretorted the inspector. \u201cIt must be taxed.\u201d\n\u201cThis inspector was cold, arrogant and stubborn,\u201d Mr. Parsons said\nas he told the story to the class. \u201cReason was wasted and so were\nfacts. . . . The longer we argued, the more stubborn he became. So I\ndecided to avoid argument, change the subject, and give him\nappreciation.\n\u201cI said, \u2018I suppose this is a very petty matter in comparison with the\nreally important and difficult decisions you\u2019re required to make. I\u2019ve\nmade a study of taxation myself. But I\u2019ve had to get my knowledge\nfrom books. You are getting yours from the firing line of experience. I\nsometimes wish I had a job like yours. It would teach me a lot.\u2019 I\nmeant every word I said.\n\u201cWell. The inspector straightened up in his chair, leaned back, and\ntalked for a long time about his work, telling me of the clever frauds\nhe had uncovered. His tone gradually became friendly, and presently\nhe was telling me about his children. As he left, he advised me that\nhe would consider my problem further and give me his decision in a\nfew days.\n\u201cHe called at my office three days later and informed me that he\nhad decided to leave the tax return exactly as it was filed.\u201d\nThis tax inspector was demonstrating one of the most common of\nhuman frailties. He wanted a feeling of importance; and as long as\nMr. Parsons argued with him, he got his feeling of importance by\nloudly asserting his authority. But as soon as his importance was\nadmitted and the argument stopped and he was permitted to expand\nhis ego, he became a sympathetic and kindly human being.\nBuddha said: \u201cHatred is never ended by hatred but by love,\u201d and a\nmisunderstanding is never ended by an argument but by tact,\ndiplomacy, conciliation and a sympathetic desire to see the other\nperson\u2019s viewpoint.\nLincoln once reprimanded a young army officer for indulging in a\nviolent controversy with an associate. \u201cNo man who is resolved to\nmake the most of himself,\u201d said Lincoln, \u201ccan spare time for personal\ncontention. Still less can he afford to take the consequences,\nincluding the vitiation of his temper and the loss of self-control. Yield\nlarger things to which you show no more than equal rights; and yield\nlesser ones though clearly your own. Better give your path to a dog\nthan be bitten by him in contesting for the right. Even killing the dog\nwould not cure the bite.\u201d\nIn an article in Bits and Pieces,* some suggestions are made on\nhow to keep a disagreement from becoming an argument:\nWelcome the disagreement. Remember the slogan, \u201cWhen\ntwo partners always agree, one of them is not necessary.\u201d If\nthere is some point you haven\u2019t thought about, be thankful if it is\nbrought to your attention. Perhaps this disagreement is your\nopportunity to be corrected before you make a serious mistake.\nDistrust your first instinctive impression. Our first natural\nreaction in a disagreeable situation is to be defensive. Be\ncareful. Keep calm and watch out for your first reaction. It may\nbe you at your worst, not your best.\nControl your temper. Remember, you can measure the size of\na person by what makes him or her angry.\nListen first. Give your opponents a chance to talk. Let them\nfinish. Do not resist, defend or debate. This only raises barriers.\nTry to build bridges of understanding. Don\u2019t build higher barriers\nof misunderstanding.\nLook for areas of agreement. When you have heard your\nopponents out, dwell first on the points and areas on which you\nagree.\nBe honest. Look for areas where you can admit error and say\nso. Apologize for your mistakes. It will help disarm your\nopponents and reduce defensiveness.\nPromise to think over your opponents\u2019 ideas and study them\ncarefully. And mean it. Your opponents may be right. It is a lot\neasier at this stage to agree to think about their points than to\nmove rapidly ahead and find yourself in a position where your\nopponents can say: \u201cWe tried to tell you, but you wouldn\u2019t listen.\u201d\nThank your opponents sincerely for their interest. Anyone who\ntakes the time to disagree with you is interested in the same\nthings you are. Think of them as people who really want to help\nyou, and you may turn your opponents into friends.\nPostpone action to give both sides time to think through the\nproblem. Suggest that a new meeting be held later that day or\nthe next day, when all the facts may be brought to bear. In\npreparation for this meeting, ask yourself some hard questions:\nCould my opponents be right? Partly right? Is there truth or\nmerit in their position or argument? Is my reaction one that will\nrelieve the problem or will it just relieve any frustration? Will my\nreaction drive my opponents further away or draw them closer to\nme? Will my reaction elevate the estimation good people have of\nme? Will I win or lose? What price will I have to pay if I win? If I\nam quiet about it, will the disagreement blow over? Is this difficult\nsituation an opportunity for me?\nOpera tenor Jan Peerce, after he was married nearly fifty years,\nonce said: \u201cMy wife and I made a pact a long time ago, and we\u2019ve\nkept it no matter how angry we\u2019ve grown with each other. When one\nyells, the other should listen\u2014because when two people yell, there is\nno communication, just noise and bad vibrations.\u201d\nPRINCIPLE 1\nThe only way to get the best of an argument is\nto avoid it."),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},"Bits and Pieces, published by The Economic Press, Fairfield, N.J.\n2\nA Sure Way of Making Enemies\u2014and How to\nAvoid It\nWhen Theodore Roosevelt was in the White House, he confessed\nthat if he could be right 75 percent of the time, he would reach the\nhighest measure of his expectation.\nIf that was the highest rating that one of the most distinguished\nmen of the twentieth century could hope to obtain, what about you\nand me?\nIf you can be sure of being right only 55 percent of the time, you\ncan go down to Wall Street and make a million dollars a day. If you\ncan\u2019t be sure of being right even 55 percent of the time, why should\nyou tell other people they are wrong?\nYou can tell people they are wrong by a look or an intonation or a\ngesture just as eloquently as you can in words\u2014and if you tell them\nthey are wrong, do you make them want to agree with you? Never!\nFor you have struck a direct blow at their intelligence, judgment,\npride and self-respect. That will make them want to strike back. But it\nwill never make them want to change their minds. You may then hurl\nat them all the logic of a Plato or an Immanuel Kant, but you will not\nalter their opinions, for you have hurt their feelings.\nNever begin by announcing \u201cI am going to prove so-and-so to you.\u201d\nThat\u2019s bad. That\u2019s tantamount to saying: \u201cI\u2019m smarter than you are.\nI\u2019m going to tell you a thing or two and make you change your mind.\u201d\nThat is a challenge. It arouses opposition and makes the listener\nwant to battle with you before you even start.\nIt is difficult, under even the most benign conditions, to change\npeople\u2019s minds. So why make it harder? Why handicap yourself?\nIf you are going to prove anything, don\u2019t let anybody know it. Do it\nso subtly, so adroitly, that no one will feel that you are doing it. This\nwas expressed succinctly by Alexander Pope:\nMen must be taught as if you taught them not\nAnd things unknown proposed as things forgot.\nOver three hundred years ago Galileo said:\nYou cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him to\nfind it within himself.\nAs Lord Chesterfield said to his son:\nBe wiser than other people if you can; but do not tell them so.\nSocrates said repeatedly to his followers in Athens:\nOne thing only I know, and that is that I know nothing.\nWell, I can\u2019t hope to be any smarter than Socrates, so I have quit\ntelling people they are wrong. And I find that it pays.\nIf a person makes a statement that you think is wrong\u2014yes, even\nthat you know is wrong\u2014isn\u2019t it better to begin by saying: \u201cWell, now,\nlook. I thought otherwise, but I may be wrong. I frequently am. And if\nI am wrong, I want to be put right. Let\u2019s examine the facts.\u201d\nThere\u2019s magic, positive magic, in such phrases as: \u201cI may be\nwrong. I frequently am. Let\u2019s examine the facts.\u201d\nNobody in the heavens above or on the earth beneath or in the\nwaters under the earth will ever object to your saying: \u201cI may be\nwrong. Let\u2019s examine the facts.\u201d\nOne of our class members who used this approach in dealing with\ncustomers was Harold Reinke, a Dodge dealer in Billings, Montana.\nHe reported that because of the pressures of the automobile\nbusiness, he was often hard-boiled and callous when dealing with\ncustomers\u2019 complaints. This caused flared tempers, loss of business\nand general unpleasantness.\nHe told his class: \u201cRecognizing that this was getting me nowhere\nfast, I tried a new tack. I would say something like this: \u2018Our\ndealership has made so many mistakes that I am frequently\nashamed. We may have erred in your case. Tell me about it.\u2019\n\u201cThis approach becomes quite disarming, and by the time the\ncustomer releases his feelings, he is usually much more reasonable\nwhen it comes to settling the matter. In fact, several customers have\nthanked me for having such an understanding attitude. And two of\nthem have even brought in friends to buy new cars. In this highly\ncompetitive market, we need more of this type of customer, and I\nbelieve that showing respect for all customers\u2019 opinions and treating\nthem diplomatically and courteously will help beat the competition.\u201d\nYou will never get into trouble by admitting that you may be wrong.\nThat will stop all argument and inspire your opponent to be just as\nfair and open and broad-minded as you are. It will make him want to\nadmit that he, too, may be wrong.\nIf you know positively that a person is wrong, and you bluntly tell\nhim or her so, what happens? Let me illustrate. Mr. S\u2014\u2014, a young\nNew York attorney, once argued a rather important case before the\nUnited States Supreme Court (Lustgarten v. Fleet Corporation 280\nU.S. 320). The case involved a considerable sum of money and an\nimportant question of law. During the argument, one of the Supreme\nCourt justices said to him: \u201cThe statute of limitations in admiralty law\nis six years, is it not?\u201d\nMr. S\u2014\u2014 stopped, stared at the justice for a moment, and then\nsaid bluntly: \u201cYour Honor, there is no statute of limitations in\nadmiralty.\u201d\n\u201cA hush fell on the court,\u201d said Mr. S\u2014\u2014 as he related his\nexperience to one of the author\u2019s classes, \u201cand the temperature in\nthe room seemed to drop to zero. I was right. Justice\u2014\u2014 was\nwrong. And I had told him so. But did that make him friendly? No. I\nstill believe that I had the law on my side. And I know that I spoke\nbetter than I ever spoke before. But I didn\u2019t persuade. I made the\nenormous blunder of telling a very learned and famous man that he\nwas wrong.\u201d\nFew people are logical. Most of us are prejudiced and biased. Most\nof us are blighted with preconceived notions, with jealousy,\nsuspicion, fear, envy and pride. And most citizens don\u2019t want to\nchange their minds about their religion or their haircut or communism\nor their favorite movie star. So, if you are inclined to tell people they\nare wrong, please read the following paragraph every morning\nbefore breakfast. It is from James Harvey Robinson\u2019s enlightening\nbook The Mind in the Making.\nWe sometimes find ourselves changing our minds without any\nresistance or heavy emotion, but if we are told we are wrong, we\nresent the imputation and harden our hearts. We are incredibly\nheedless in the formation of our beliefs, but find ourselves filled\nwith an illicit passion for them when anyone proposes to rob us\nof their companionship. It is obviously not the ideas themselves\nthat are dear to us, but our self-esteem which is threatened. . . .\nThe little word \u201cmy\u201d is the most important one in human affairs,\nand properly to reckon with it is the beginning of wisdom. It has\nthe same force whether it is \u201cmy\u201d dinner, \u201cmy\u201d dog, and \u201cmy\u201d\nhouse, or \u201cmy\u201d father, \u201cmy\u201d country, and \u201cmy\u201d God. We not only\nresent the imputation that our watch is wrong, or our car shabby,\nbut that our conception of the canals of Mars, of the\npronunciation of \u201cEpictetus,\u201d of the medicinal value of salicin, or\nof the date of Sargon I is subject to revision. We like to continue\nto believe what we have been accustomed to accept as true,\nand the resentment aroused when doubt is cast upon any of our\nassumptions leads us to seek every manner of excuse for\nclinging to it. The result is that most of our so-called reasoning\nconsists in finding arguments for going on believing as we\nalready do.\nCarl Rogers, the eminent psychologist, wrote in his book On\nBecoming a Person:\nI have found it of enormous value when I can permit myself to\nunderstand the other person. The way in which I have worded\nthis statement may seem strange to you. Is it necessary to\npermit oneself to understand another? I think it is. Our first\nreaction to most of the statements (which we hear from other\npeople) is an evaluation or judgment, rather than an\nunderstanding of it. When someone expresses some feeling,\nattitude or belief, our tendency is almost immediately to feel\n\u201cthat\u2019s right,\u201d or \u201cthat\u2019s stupid,\u201d \u201cthat\u2019s abnormal,\u201d \u201cthat\u2019s\nunreasonable,\u201d \u201cthat\u2019s incorrect,\u201d \u201cthat\u2019s not nice.\u201d Very rarely do\nwe permit ourselves to understand precisely what the meaning\nof the statement is to the other person.*\nI once employed an interior decorator to make some draperies for\nmy home. When the bill arrived, I was dismayed.\nA few days later, a friend dropped in and looked at the draperies.\nThe price was mentioned, and she exclaimed with a note of triumph:\n\u201cWhat? That\u2019s awful. I am afraid he put one over on you.\u201d\nTrue? Yes, she had told the truth, but few people like to listen to\ntruths that reflect on their judgment. So, being human, I tried to\ndefend myself. I pointed out that the best is eventually the cheapest,\nthat one can\u2019t expect to get quality and artistic taste at bargain\x02basement prices, and so on and on.\nThe next day another friend dropped in, admired the draperies,\nbubbled over with enthusiasm, and expressed a wish that she could\nafford such exquisite creations for her home. My reaction was totally\ndifferent. \u201cWell, to tell the truth,\u201d I said, \u201cI can\u2019t afford them myself. I\npaid too much. I\u2019m sorry I ordered them.\u201d\nWhen we are wrong, we may admit it to ourselves. And if we are\nhandled gently and tactfully, we may admit it to others and even take\npride in our frankness and broad-mindedness. But not if someone\nelse is trying to ram the unpalatable fact down our esophagus.\nHorace Greeley, the most famous editor in America during the time\nof the Civil War, disagreed violently with Lincoln\u2019s policies. He\nbelieved that he could drive Lincoln into agreeing with him by a\ncampaign of argument, ridicule and abuse. He waged this bitter\ncampaign month after month, year after year. In fact, he wrote a\nbrutal, bitter, sarcastic and personal attack on President Lincoln the\nnight Booth shot him.\nBut did all this bitterness make Lincoln agree with Greeley? Not at\nall. Ridicule and abuse never do.\nIf you want some excellent suggestions about dealing with people\nand managing yourself and improving your personality, read\nBenjamin Franklin\u2019s autobiography\u2014one of the most fascinating life\nstories ever written, one of the classics of American literature. Ben\nFranklin tells how he conquered the iniquitous habit of argument and\ntransformed himself into one of the most able, suave and diplomatic\nmen in American history.\nOne day, when Ben Franklin was a blundering youth, an old\nQuaker friend took him aside and lashed him with a few stinging\ntruths, something like this:\nBen, you are impossible. Your opinions have a slap in them for\neveryone who differs with you. They have become so offensive\nthat nobody cares for them. Your friends find they enjoy\nthemselves better when you are not around. You know so much\nthat no man can tell you anything. Indeed, no man is going to try,\nfor the effort would lead only to discomfort and hard work. So\nyou are not likely ever to know any more than you do now, which\nis very little.\nOne of the finest things I know about Ben Franklin is the way he\naccepted that smarting rebuke. He was big enough and wise enough\nto realize that it was true, to sense that he was headed for failure\nand social disaster. So he made a right-about-face. He began\nimmediately to change his insolent, opinionated ways.\n\u201cI made it a rule,\u201d said Franklin, \u201cto forbear all direct contradiction to\nthe sentiment of others, and all positive assertion of my own. I even\nforbade myself the use of every word or expression in the language\nthat imported a fix\u2019d opinion, such as \u2018certainly,\u2019 \u2018undoubtedly,\u2019 etc.,\nand I adopted, instead of them, \u2018I conceive,\u2019 \u2018I apprehend,\u2019 or \u2018I\nimagine\u2019 a thing to be so or so, or \u2018it so appears to me at present.\u2019\nWhen another asserted something that I thought an error, I deny\u2019d\nmyself the pleasure of contradicting him abruptly, and of showing\nimmediately some absurdity in his proposition: and in answering I\nbegan by observing that in certain cases or circumstances his\nopinion would be right, but in the present case there appear\u2019d or\nseem\u2019d to me some difference, etc. I soon found the advantage of\nthis change in my manner; the conversations I engag\u2019d in went on\nmore pleasantly. The modest way in which I propos\u2019d my opinions\nprocur\u2019d them a readier reception and less contradiction; I had less\nmortification when I was found to be in the wrong, and I more easily\nprevail\u2019d with others to give up their mistakes and join with me when\nI happened to be in the right.\n\u201cAnd this mode, which I at first put on with some violence to natural\ninclination, became at length so easy, and so habitual to me, that\nperhaps for these fifty years past no one has ever heard a\ndogmatical expression escape me. And to this habit (after my\ncharacter of integrity) I think it principally owing that I had earned so\nmuch weight with my fellow citizens when I proposed new\ninstitutions, or alterations in the old, and so much influence in public\ncouncils when I became a member; for I was but a bad speaker,\nnever eloquent, subject to much hesitation in my choice of words,\nhardly correct in language, and yet I generally carried my points.\u201d\nHow do Ben Franklin\u2019s methods work in business? Let\u2019s take two\nexamples.\nKatherine A. Allred of Kings Mountain, North Carolina, is an\nindustrial engineering supervisor for a yarn-processing plant. She\ntold one of our classes how she handled a sensitive problem before\nand after taking our training:\n\u201cPart of my responsibility,\u201d she reported, \u201cdeals with setting up and\nmaintaining incentive systems and standards for our operators so\nthey can make more money by producing more yarn. The system we\nwere using had worked fine when we had only two or three different\ntypes of yarn, but recently we had expanded our inventory and\ncapabilities to enable us to run more than twelve different varieties.\nThe present system was no longer adequate to pay the operators\nfairly for the work being performed and give them an incentive to\nincrease production. I had worked up a new system which would\nenable us to pay the operator by the class of yarn she was running\nat any one particular time. With my new system in hand, I entered\nthe meeting determined to prove to the management that my system\nwas the right approach. I told them in detail how they were wrong\nand showed where they were being unfair and how I had all the\nanswers they needed. To say the least, I failed miserably! I had\nbecome so busy defending my position on the new system that I had\nleft them no opening to graciously admit their problems on the old\none. The issue was dead.\n\u201cAfter several sessions of this course, I realized all too well where I\nhad made my mistakes. I called another meeting and this time I\nasked where they felt their problems were. We discussed each point,\nand I asked them their opinions on which was the best way to\nproceed. With a few low-keyed suggestions, at proper intervals, I let\nthem develop my system themselves. At the end of the meeting\nwhen I actually presented my system, they enthusiastically accepted\nit.\n\u201cI am convinced now that nothing good is accomplished and a lot\nof damage can be done if you tell a person straight out that he or she\nis wrong. You only succeed in stripping that person of self-dignity\nand making yourself an unwelcome part of any discussion.\u201d\nLet\u2019s take another example\u2014and remember these cases I am\nciting are typical of the experiences of thousands of other people. R.\nV. Crowley was a salesman for a lumber company in New York.\nCrowley admitted that he had been telling hard-boiled lumber\ninspectors for years that they were wrong. And he had won the\narguments too. But it hadn\u2019t done any good. \u201cFor these lumber\ninspectors,\u201d said Mr. Crowley, \u201care like baseball umpires. Once they\nmake a decision, they never change it.\u201d\nMr. Crowley saw that his firm was losing thousands of dollars\nthrough the arguments he won. So while taking my course, he\nresolved to change tactics and abandon arguments. With what\nresults? Here is the story as he told it to the fellow members of his\nclass:\n\u201cOne morning the phone rang in my office. A hot and bothered\nperson at the other end proceeded to inform me that a car of lumber\nwe had shipped into his plant was entirely unsatisfactory. His firm\nhad stopped unloading and requested that we make immediate\narrangements to remove the stock from their yard. After about one\x02fourth of the car had been unloaded, their lumber inspector reported\nthat the lumber was running 55 percent below grade. Under the\ncircumstances, they refused to accept it.\n\u201cI immediately started for his plant and on the way turned over in\nmy mind the best way to handle the situation. Ordinarily, under such\ncircumstances, I should have quoted grading rules and tried, as a\nresult of my own experience and knowledge as a lumber inspector,\nto convince the other inspector that the lumber was actually up to\ngrade, and that he was misinterpreting the rules in his inspection.\nHowever, I thought I would apply the principles learned in this\ntraining.\n\u201cWhen I arrived at the plant, I found the purchasing agent and the\nlumber inspector in a wicked humor, both set for an argument and a\nfight. We walked out to the car that was being unloaded, and I\nrequested that they continue to unload so that I could see how things\nwere going. I asked the inspector to go right ahead and lay out the\nrejects, as he had been doing, and to put the good pieces in another\npile.\n\u201cAfter watching him for a while it began to dawn on me that his\ninspection actually was much too strict and that he was\nmisinterpreting the rules. This particular lumber was white pine, and I\nknew the inspector was thoroughly schooled in hard woods but not a\ncompetent, experienced inspector on white pine. White pine\nhappened to be my own strong suit, but did I offer any objection to\nthe way he was grading the lumber? None whatever. I kept on\nwatching and gradually began to ask questions as to why certain\npieces were not satisfactory. I didn\u2019t for one instant insinuate that the\ninspector was wrong. I emphasized that my only reason for asking\nwas in order that we could give his firm exactly what they wanted in\nfuture shipments.\n\u201cBy asking questions in a very friendly, cooperative spirit, and\ninsisting continually that they were right in laying out boards not\nsatisfactory to their purpose, I got him warmed up, and the strained\nrelations between us began to thaw and melt away. An occasional\ncarefully put remark on my part gave birth to the idea in his mind that\npossibly some of these rejected pieces were actually within the\ngrade that they had bought, and that their requirements demanded a\nmore expensive grade. I was very careful, however, not to let him\nthink I was making an issue of this point.\n\u201cGradually his whole attitude changed. He finally admitted to me\nthat he was not experienced on white pine and began to ask me\nquestions about each piece as it came out of the car. I would explain\nwhy such a piece came within the grade specified, but kept on\ninsisting that we did not want him to take it if it was unsuitable for\ntheir purpose. He finally got to the point where he felt guilty every\ntime he put a piece in the rejected pile. And at last he saw that the\nmistake was on their part for not having specified as good a grade as\nthey needed.\n\u201cThe ultimate outcome was that he went through the entire carload\nagain after I left, accepted the whole lot, and we received a check in\nfull.\n\u201cIn that one instance alone, a little tact, and the determination to\nrefrain from telling the other man he was wrong, saved my company\na substantial amount of cash, and it would be hard to place a money\nvalue on the good will that was saved.\u201d\nMartin Luther King was asked how, as a pacifist, he could be an\nadmirer of Air Force General Daniel \u201cChappie\u201d James, then the\nnation\u2019s highest-ranking black officer. Dr. King replied, \u201cI judge\npeople by their own principles\u2014not by my own.\u201d\nIn a similar way, General Robert E. Lee once spoke to the\npresident of the Confederacy, Jefferson Davis, in the most glowing\nterms about a certain officer under his command. Another officer in\nattendance was astonished. \u201cGeneral,\u201d he said, \u201cdo you not know\nthat the man of whom you speak so highly is one of your bitterest\nenemies who misses no opportunity to malign you?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d replied\nGeneral Lee, \u201cbut the president asked my opinion of him; he did not\nask for his opinion of me.\u201d\nBy the way, I am not revealing anything new in this chapter. Two\nthousand years ago, Jesus said: \u201cAgree with thine adversary\nquickly.\u201d\nAnd 2,200 years before Christ was born, King Akhtoi of Egypt gave\nhis son some shrewd advice\u2014advice that is sorely needed today.\n\u201cBe diplomatic,\u201d counseled the King. \u201cIt will help you gain your point.\u201d\nIn other words, don\u2019t argue with your customer or your spouse or\nyour adversary.

Rogers, On Becoming a Person (Boston:\nHoughton Mifflin, 1961), pp. 18ff.\n3\nIf You\u2019re Wrong, Admit It\nWithin a minute\u2019s walk of my house there was a wild stretch of virgin\ntimber, where the blackberry thickets foamed white in the springtime,\nwhere the squirrels nested and reared their young, and the\nhorseweeds grew as tall as a horse\u2019s head. This unspoiled woodland\nwas called Forest Park\u2014and it was a forest, probably not much\ndifferent in appearance from what it was when Columbus discovered\nAmerica. I frequently walked in this park with Rex, my little Boston\nbulldog. He was a friendly, harmless little hound; and since we rarely\nmet anyone in the park, I took Rex along without a leash or a\nmuzzle.\nOne day we encountered a mounted policeman in the park, a\npoliceman itching to show his authority.\n\u201cWhat do you mean by letting that dog run loose in the park without\na muzzle and leash?\u201d he reprimanded me. \u201cDon\u2019t you know it\u2019s\nagainst the law?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I know it is,\u201d I replied softly, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t think he would do any\nharm out here.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t think! You didn\u2019t think! The law doesn\u2019t give a tinker\u2019s\ndamn about what you think. That dog might kill a squirrel or bite a\nchild. Now, I\u2019m going to let you off this time, but if I catch this dog out\nhere again without a muzzle and a leash, you\u2019ll have to tell it to the\njudge.\u201d\nI meekly promised to obey.\nAnd I did obey\u2014for a few times. But Rex didn\u2019t like the muzzle,\nand neither did I; so we decided to take a chance. Everything was\nlovely for a while, and then we struck a snag. Rex and I raced over\nthe brow of a hill one afternoon and there, suddenly\u2014to my dismay\n\u2014I saw the majesty of the law, astride a bay horse. Rex was out in\nfront, heading straight for the officer.\nI was in for it. I knew it. So I didn\u2019t wait until the policeman started\ntalking. I beat him to it. I said: \u201cOfficer, you\u2019ve caught me red-handed.\nI\u2019m guilty. I have no alibis, no excuses. You warned me last week\nthat if I brought the dog out here again without a muzzle you would\nfine me.\u201d\n\u201cWell, now,\u201d the policeman responded in a soft tone. \u201cI know it\u2019s a\ntemptation to let a little dog like that have a run out here when\nnobody is around.\u201d\n\u201cSure it\u2019s a temptation,\u201d I replied, \u201cbut it is against the law.\u201d\n\u201cWell, a little dog like that isn\u2019t going to harm anybody,\u201d the\npoliceman remonstrated.\n\u201cNo, but he may kill squirrels,\u201d I said.\n\u201cWell now, I think you are taking this a bit too seriously,\u201d he told me.\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what you do. You just let him run over the hill there where\nI can\u2019t see him\u2014and we\u2019ll forget all about it.\u201d\nThat policeman, being human, wanted a feeling of importance; so\nwhen I began to condemn myself, the only way he could nourish his\nself-esteem was to take the magnanimous attitude of showing\nmercy.\nBut suppose I had tried to defend myself\u2014well, did you ever argue\nwith a policeman?\nBut instead of breaking lances with him, I admitted that he was\nabsolutely right and I was absolutely wrong; I admitted it quickly,\nopenly, and with enthusiasm. The affair terminated graciously in my\ntaking his side and his taking my side. Lord Chesterfield himself\ncould hardly have been more gracious than this mounted policeman,\nwho, only a week previously, had threatened to have the law on me.\nIf we know we are going to be rebuked anyhow, isn\u2019t it far better to\nbeat the other person to it and do it ourselves? Isn\u2019t it much easier to\nlisten to self-criticism than to bear condemnation from alien lips?\nSay about yourself all the derogatory things you know the other\nperson is thinking or wants to say or intends to say\u2014and say them\nbefore that person has a chance to say them. The chances are a\nhundred to one that a generous, forgiving attitude will be taken and\nyour mistakes will be minimized just as the mounted policeman did\nwith me and Rex.\nFerdinand E. Warren, a commercial artist, used this technique to\nwin the good will of a petulant, scolding buyer of art.\n\u201cIt is important, in making drawings for advertising and publishing\npurposes, to be precise and very exact,\u201d Mr. Warren said as he told\nthe story.\n\u201cSome art editors demand that their commissions be executed\nimmediately; and in these cases, some slight error is liable to occur. I\nknew one art director in particular who was always delighted to find\nfault with some little thing. I have often left his office in disgust, not\nbecause of the criticism, but because of his method of attack.\nRecently I delivered a rush job to this editor, and he phoned me to\ncall at his office immediately. He said something was wrong. When I\narrived, I found just what I had anticipated\u2014and dreaded. He was\nhostile, gloating over his chance to criticize. He demanded with heat\nwhy I had done so and so. My opportunity had come to apply the\nself-criticism I had been studying about. So I said: \u2018Mr. So-and-so, if\nwhat you say is true, I am at fault and there is absolutely no excuse\nfor my blunder. I have been doing drawings for you long enough to\nknow better. I\u2019m ashamed of myself.\u2019\n\u201cImmediately he started to defend me. \u2018Yes, you\u2019re right, but after\nall, this isn\u2019t a serious mistake. It is only\u2014\u2019\n\u201cI interrupted him. \u2018Any mistake,\u2019 I said, \u2018may be costly and they are\nall irritating.\u2019\n\u201cHe started to break in, but I wouldn\u2019t let him. I was having a grand\ntime. For the first time in my life, I was criticizing myself\u2014and I loved\nit.\n\u201c\u2018I should have been more careful,\u2019 I continued. \u2018You give me a lot\nof work, and you deserve the best; so I\u2019m going to do this drawing all\nover.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018No! No!\u2019 he protested. \u2018I wouldn\u2019t think of putting you to all that\ntrouble.\u2019 He praised my work, assured me that he wanted only a\nminor change and that my slight error hadn\u2019t cost his firm any\nmoney; and, after all, it was a mere detail\u2014not worth worrying about.\n\u201cMy eagerness to criticize myself took all the fight out of him. He\nended up by taking me to lunch; and before we parted, he gave me a\ncheck and another commission.\u201d\nThere is a certain degree of satisfaction in having the courage to\nadmit one\u2019s errors. It not only clears the air of guilt and\ndefensiveness, but often helps solve the problem created by the\nerror.\nBruce Harvey of Albuquerque, New Mexico, had incorrectly\nauthorized payment of full wages to an employee on sick leave.\nWhen he discovered his error, he brought it to the attention of the\nemployee and explained that to correct the mistake he would have to\nreduce his next paycheck by the entire amount of the overpayment.\nThe employee pleaded that as that would cause him a serious\nfinancial problem, could the money be repaid over a period of time?\nIn order to do this, Harvey explained, he would have to obtain his\nsupervisor\u2019s approval. \u201cAnd this I knew,\u201d reported Harvey, \u201cwould\nresult in a boss-type explosion. While trying to decide how to handle\nthis situation better, I realized that the whole mess was my fault and I\nwould have to admit it to my boss.\n\u201cI walked into his office, told him that I had made a mistake and\nthen informed him of the complete facts. He replied in an explosive\nmanner that it was the fault of the personnel department. I repeated\nthat it was my fault. He exploded again about carelessness in the\naccounting department. Again I explained it was my fault. He blamed\ntwo other people in the office. But each time I reiterated it was my\nfault. Finally, he looked at me and said, \u2018Okay, it was your fault. Now\nstraighten it out.\u2019 The error was corrected and nobody got into\ntrouble. I felt great because I was able to handle a tense situation\nand had the courage not to seek alibis. My boss has had more\nrespect for me ever since.\u201d\nAny fool can try to defend his or her mistakes\u2014and most fools do\n\u2014but it raises one above the herd and gives one a feeling of nobility\nand exultation to admit one\u2019s mistakes. For example, one of the most\nbeautiful things that history records about Robert E. Lee is the way\nhe blamed himself and only himself for the failure of Pickett\u2019s charge\nat Gettysburg.\nPickett\u2019s charge was undoubtedly the most brilliant and\npicturesque attack that ever occurred in the Western world. General\nGeorge E. Pickett himself was picturesque. He wore his hair so long\nthat his auburn locks almost touched his shoulders; and, like\nNapoleon in his Italian campaigns, he wrote ardent love-letters\nalmost daily while in the battlefield. His devoted troops cheered him\nthat tragic July afternoon as he rode off jauntily toward the Union\nlines, his cap set at a rakish angle over his right ear. They cheered\nand they followed him, man touching man, rank pressing rank, with\nbanners flying and bayonets gleaming in the sun. It was a gallant\nsight. Daring. Magnificent. A murmur of admiration ran through the\nUnion lines as they beheld it.\nPickett\u2019s troops swept forward at any easy trot, through orchard\nand cornfield, across a meadow and over a ravine. All the time, the\nenemy\u2019s cannon was tearing ghastly holes in their ranks. But on they\npressed, grim, irresistible.\nSuddenly the Union infantry rose from behind the stone wall on\nCemetery Ridge where they had been hiding and fired volley after\nvolley into Pickett\u2019s onrushing troops. The crest of the hill was a\nsheet of flame, a slaughterhouse, a blazing volcano. In a few\nminutes, all of Pickett\u2019s brigade commanders except one were down,\nand four-fifths of his five thousand men had fallen.\nGeneral Lewis A. Armistead, leading the troops in the final plunge,\nran forward, vaulted over the stone wall, and, waving his cap on the\ntop of his sword, shouted:\n\u201cGive \u2019em the steel, boys!\u201d\nThey did. They leaped over the wall, bayoneted their enemies,\nsmashed skulls with clubbed muskets, and planted the battleflags of\nthe South on Cemetery Ridge.\nThe banners waved there only for a moment. But that moment,\nbrief as it was, recorded the high-water mark of the Confederacy.\nPickett\u2019s charge\u2014brilliant, heroic\u2014was nevertheless the beginning\nof the end. Lee had failed. He could not penetrate the North. And he\nknew it.\nThe South was doomed.\nLee was so saddened, so shocked, that he sent in his resignation\nand asked Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy, to\nappoint \u201ca younger and abler man.\u201d If Lee had wanted to blame the\ndisastrous failure of Pickett\u2019s charge on someone else, he could\nhave found a score of alibis. Some of his division commanders had\nfailed him. The cavalry hadn\u2019t arrived in time to support the infantry\nattack. This had gone wrong and that had gone awry.\nBut Lee was far too noble to blame others. As Pickett\u2019s beaten and\nbloody troops struggled back to the Confederate lines, Robert E. Lee\nrode out to meet them all alone and greeted them with a self\x02condemnation that was little short of sublime. \u201cAll this has been my\nfault,\u201d he confessed. \u201cI and I alone have lost this battle.\u201d\nFew generals in all history have had the courage and character to\nadmit that.\nMichael Cheung, who teaches our course in Hong Kong, told of\nhow the Chinese culture presents some special problems and how\nsometimes it is necessary to recognize that the benefit of applying a\nprinciple may be more advantageous than maintaining an old\ntradition. He had one middle-aged class member who had been\nestranged from his son for many years. The father had been an\nopium addict, but was now cured. In Chinese tradition an older\nperson cannot take the first step. The father felt that it was up to his\nson to take the initiative toward a reconciliation. In an early session,\nhe told the class about the grandchildren he had never seen and\nhow much he desired to be reunited with his son. His classmates, all\nChinese, understood his conflict between his desire and long\x02established tradition. The father felt that young people should have\nrespect for their elders and that he was right in not giving in to his\ndesire, but to wait for his son to come to him.\nToward the end of the course the father again addressed his class.\n\u201cI have pondered this problem,\u201d he said. \u201cDale Carnegie says, \u2018If you\nare wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.\u2019 It is too late for me to\nadmit it quickly, but I can admit it emphatically. I wronged my son. He\nwas right in not wanting to see me and to expel me from his life. I\nmay lose face by asking a younger person\u2019s forgiveness, but I was at\nfault and it is my responsibility to admit this.\u201d The class applauded\nand gave him their full support. At the next class he told how he went\nto his son\u2019s house, asked for and received forgiveness and was now\nembarked on a new relationship with his son, his daughter-in-law\nand the grandchildren he had at last met.\nElbert Hubbard was one of the most original authors who ever\nstirred up a nation, and his stinging sentences often aroused fierce\nresentment. But Hubbard, with his rare skill for handling people,\nfrequently turned his enemies into friends.\nFor example, when some irritated reader wrote in to say that he\ndidn\u2019t agree with such and such an article and ended by calling\nHubbard this and that, Elbert Hubbard would answer like this:\nCome to think it over, I don\u2019t entirely agree with it myself. Not\neverything I wrote yesterday appeals to me today. I am glad to\nlearn what you think on the subject. The next time you are in the\nneighborhood you must visit us and we\u2019ll get this subject\nthreshed out for all time. So here is a handclasp over the miles,\nand I am,\nYours sincerely,\nWhat could you say to a man who treated you like that?\nWhen we are right, let\u2019s try to win people gently and tactfully to our\nway of thinking, and when we are wrong\u2014and that will be\nsurprisingly often, if we are honest with ourselves\u2014let\u2019s admit our\nmistakes quickly and with enthusiasm. Not only will that technique\nproduce astonishing results; but, believe it or not, it is a lot more fun,\nunder the circumstances, than trying to defend oneself.\nRemember the old proverb: \u201cBy fighting you never get enough, but\nby yielding you get more than you expected.\u201d\nPRINCIPLE 3\nIf you are wrong, admit it quickly and\nemphatically.\n4\nA Drop of Honey\nIf your temper is aroused and you tell \u2019em a thing or two, you will\nhave a fine time unloading your feelings. But what about the other\nperson? Will he share your pleasure? Will your belligerent tones,\nyour hostile attitude, make it easy for him to agree with you?\n\u201cIf you come at me with your fists doubled,\u201d said Woodrow Wilson,\n\u201cI think I can promise you that mine will double as fast as yours; but if\nyou come to me and say, \u2018Let us sit down and take counsel together,\nand, if we differ from each other, understand why it is that we differ,\njust what the points at issue are,\u2019 we will presently find that we are\nnot so far apart after all, that the points on which we differ are few\nand the points on which we agree are many, and that if we only have\nthe patience and the candor and the desire to get together, we will\nget together.\u201d\nNobody appreciated the truth of Woodrow Wilson\u2019s statement more\nthan John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Back in 1915, Rockefeller was the most\nfiercely despised man in Colorado. One of the bloodiest strikes in the\nhistory of American industry had been shocking the state for two\nterrible years. Irate, belligerent miners were demanding higher\nwages from the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company; Rockefeller\ncontrolled that company. Property had been destroyed, troops had\nbeen called out. Blood had been shed. Strikers had been shot, their\nbodies riddled with bullets.\nAt a time like that, with the air seething with hatred, Rockefeller\nwanted to win the strikers to his way of thinking. And he did it. How?\nHere\u2019s the story. After weeks spent in making friends, Rockefeller\naddressed the representatives of the strikers. This speech, in its\nentirety, is a masterpiece. It produced astonishing results. It calmed\nthe tempestuous waves of hate that threatened to engulf Rockefeller.\nIt won him a host of admirers. It presented facts in such a friendly\nmanner that the strikers went back to work without saying another\nword about the increase in wages for which they had fought so\nviolently.\nThe opening of that remarkable speech follows. Note how it fairly\nglows with friendliness. Rockefeller, remember, was talking to men\nwho, a few days previously, had wanted to hang him by the neck to a\nsour apple tree; yet he couldn\u2019t have been more gracious, more\nfriendly if he had addressed a group of medical missionaries. His\nspeech was radiant with such phrases as I am proud to be here,\nhaving visited in your homes, met many of your wives and children,\nwe meet here not as strangers, but as friends . . . spirit of mutual\nfriendship, our common interests, it is only by your courtesy that I am\nhere.\n\u201cThis is a red-letter day in my life,\u201d Rockefeller began. \u201cIt is the first\ntime I have ever had the good fortune to meet the representatives of\nthe employees of this great company, its officers and\nsuperintendents, together, and I can assure you that I am proud to\nbe here, and that I shall remember this gathering as long as I live.\nHad this meeting been held two weeks ago, I should have stood\nhere a stranger to most of you, recognizing a few faces. Having had\nthe opportunity last week of visiting all the camps in the southern\ncoal field and of talking individually with practically all of the\nrepresentatives, except those who were away; having visited in your\nhomes, met many of your wives and children, we meet here not as\nstrangers, but as friends, and it is in that spirit of mutual friendship\nthat I am glad to have this opportunity to discuss with you our\ncommon interests.\n\u201cSince this is a meeting of the officers of the company and the\nrepresentatives of the employees, it is only by your courtesy that I\nam here, for I am not so fortunate as to be either one or the other;\nand yet I feel that I am intimately associated with you men, for, in a\nsense, I represent both the stockholders and the directors.\u201d\nIsn\u2019t that a superb example of the fine art of making friends out of\nenemies?\nSuppose Rockefeller had taken a different tack. Suppose he had\nargued with those miners and hurled devastating facts in their faces.\nSuppose he had told them by his tones and insinuations that they\nwere wrong. Suppose that, by all the rules of logic, he had proved\nthat they were wrong. What would have happened? More anger\nwould have been stirred up, more hatred, more revolt.\nIf a man\u2019s heart is rankling with discord and ill feeling toward\nyou, you can\u2019t win him to your way of thinking with all the logic in\nChristendom. Scolding parents and domineering bosses and\nhusbands and nagging wives ought to realize that people don\u2019t\nwant to change their minds. They can\u2019t be forced or driven to\nagree with you or me. But they may possibly be led to, if we are\ngentle and friendly, ever so gentle and ever so friendly.\nLincoln said that, in effect, over a hundred years ago. Here are his\nwords:\nIt is an old and true maxim that \u201ca drop of honey catches more flies\nthan a gallon of gall.\u201d So with men, if you would win a man to your\ncause, first convince him that you are his sincere friend. Therein is a\ndrop of honey that catches his heart; which, say what you will, is the\ngreat high road to reason.\nBusiness executives have learned that it pays to be friendly to\nstrikers. For example, when 2,500 employees in the White Motor\nCompany\u2019s plant struck for higher wages and a union shop, Robert\nF. Black, then president of the company, didn\u2019t lose his temper and\ncondemn and threaten and talk of tyranny and Communists. He\nactually praised the strikers. He published an advertisement in the\nCleveland papers, complimenting them on \u201cthe peaceful way in\nwhich they laid down their tools.\u201d Finding the strike pickets idle, he\nbought them a couple of dozen baseball bats and gloves and invited\nthem to play ball on vacant lots. For those who preferred bowling, he\nrented a bowling alley.\nThis friendliness on Mr. Black\u2019s part did what friendliness always\ndoes: it begot friendliness. So the strikers borrowed brooms,\nshovels, and rubbish carts, and began picking up matches, papers,\ncigarette stubs, and cigar butts around the factory. Imagine it!\nImagine strikers tidying up the factory grounds while battling for\nhigher wages and recognition of the union. Such an event had never\nbeen heard of before in the long, tempestuous history of American\nlabor wars. That strike ended with a compromise settlement within a\nweek\u2014ended without any ill feeling or rancor.\nDaniel Webster, who looked like a god and talked like Jehovah,\nwas one of the most successful advocates who ever pleaded a case;\nyet he ushered in his most powerful arguments with such friendly\nremarks as: \u201cIt will be for the jury to consider,\u201d \u201cThis may, perhaps,\nbe worth thinking of,\u201d \u201cHere are some facts that I trust you will not\nlose sight of,\u201d or \u201cYou, with your knowledge of human nature, will\neasily see the significance of these facts.\u201d No bulldozing. No high\x02pressure methods. No attempt to force his opinions on others.\nWebster used the soft-spoken, quiet, friendly approach, and it helped\nto make him famous.\nYou may never be called upon to settle a strike or address a jury,\nbut you may want to get your rent reduced. Will the friendly approach\nhelp you then? Let\u2019s see.\nO. L. Straub, an engineer, wanted to get his rent reduced. And he\nknew his landlord was hard-boiled. \u201cI wrote him,\u201d Mr. Straub said in a\nspeech before the class, \u201cnotifying him that I was vacating my\napartment as soon as my lease expired. The truth was, I didn\u2019t want\nto move. I wanted to stay if I could get my rent reduced. But the\nsituation seemed hopeless. Other tenants had tried\u2014and failed.\nEveryone told me that the landlord was extremely difficult to deal\nwith. But I said to myself, \u2018I am studying a course in how to deal with\npeople, so I\u2019ll try it on him\u2014and see how it works.\u2019\n\u201cHe and his secretary came to see me as soon as he got my letter.\nI met him at the door with a friendly greeting. I fairly bubbled with\ngood will and enthusiasm. I didn\u2019t begin talking about how high the\nrent was. I began talking about how much I liked his apartment\nhouse. Believe me, I was \u2018hearty in my approbation and lavish in my\npraise.\u2019 I complimented him on the way he ran the building and told\nhim I should like so much to stay for another year but I couldn\u2019t\nafford it.\n\u201cHe had evidently never had such a reception from a tenant. He\nhardly knew what to make of it.\n\u201cThen he started to tell me his troubles. Complaining tenants. One\nhad written him fourteen letters, some of them positively insulting.\nAnother threatened to break his lease unless the landlord kept the\nman on the floor above from snoring. \u2018What a relief it is,\u2019 he said, \u2018to\nhave a satisfied tenant like you.\u2019 And then, without my even asking\nhim to do it, he offered to reduce my rent a little. I wanted more, so I\nnamed the figure I could afford to pay, and he accepted without a\nword.\n\u201cAs he was leaving, he turned to me and asked, \u2018What decorating\ncan I do for you?\u2019\n\u201cIf I had tried to get the rent reduced by the methods the other\ntenants were using, I am positive I should have met with the same\nfailure they encountered. It was the friendly, sympathetic,\nappreciative approach that won.\u201d\nDean Woodcock of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is the superintendent\nof a department of the local electric company. His staff was called\nupon to repair some equipment on top of a pole. This type of work\nhad formerly been performed by a different department and had only\nrecently been transferred to Woodcock\u2019s section. Although his\npeople had been trained in the work, this was the first time they had\never actually been called upon to do it. Everybody in the organization\nwas interested in seeing if and how they could handle it. Mr.\nWoodcock, several of his subordinate managers, and members of\nother departments of the utility went to see the operation. Many cars\nand trucks were there, and a number of people were standing\naround watching the two lone men on top of the pole.\nGlancing around, Woodcock noticed a man up the street getting\nout of his car with a camera. He began taking pictures of the scene.\nUtility people are extremely conscious of public relations, and\nsuddenly Woodcock realized what this setup looked like to the man\nwith the camera\u2014overkill, dozens of people being called out to do a\ntwo-person job. He strolled up the street to the photographer.\n\u201cI see you\u2019re interested in our operation.\u201d\n\u201cYes, and my mother will be more than interested. She owns stock\nin your company. This will be an eye-opener for her. She may even\ndecide her investment was unwise. I\u2019ve been telling her for years\nthere\u2019s a lot of waste motion in companies like yours. This proves it.\nThe newspapers might like these pictures, too.\u201d\n\u201cIt does look like it, doesn\u2019t it? I\u2019d think the same thing in your\nposition. But this is a unique situation. . . .\u201d And Dean Woodcock\nwent on to explain how this was the first job of this type for his\ndepartment and how everybody from executives down was\ninterested. He assured the man that under normal conditions two\npeople could handle the job. The photographer put away his camera,\nshook Woodcock\u2019s hand, and thanked him for taking the time to\nexplain the situation to him.\nDean Woodcock\u2019s friendly approach saved his company much\nembarrassment and bad publicity.\nAnother member of one of our classes, Gerald H. Winn of Littleton,\nNew Hampshire, reported how by using a friendly approach, he\nobtained a very satisfactory settlement on a damage claim.\n\u201cEarly in the spring,\u201d he reported, \u201cbefore the ground had thawed\nfrom the winter freezing, there was an unusually heavy rainstorm\nand the water, which normally would have run off to nearby ditches\nand storm drains along the road, took a new course onto a building\nlot where I had just built a new home.\n\u201cNot being able to run off, the water pressure built up around the\nfoundation of the house. The water forced itself under the concrete\nbasement floor, causing it to explode, and the basement filled with\nwater. This ruined the furnace and the hot-water heater. The cost to\nrepair this damage was in excess of two thousand dollars. I had no\ninsurance to cover this type of damage.\n\u201cHowever, I soon found out that the owner of the subdivision had\nneglected to put in a storm drain near the house which could have\nprevented this problem. I made an appointment to see him. During\nthe twenty-five-mile trip to his office, I carefully reviewed the situation\nand, remembering the principles I learned in this course, I decided\nthat showing my anger would not serve any worthwhile purpose.\nWhen I arrived, I kept very calm and started by talking about his\nrecent vacation to the West Indies; then, when I felt the timing was\nright, I mentioned the \u2018little\u2019 problem of water damage. He quickly\nagreed to do his share in helping to correct the problem.\n\u201cA few days later he called and said he would pay for the damage\nand also put in a storm drain to prevent the same thing from\nhappening in the future.\n\u201cEven though it was the fault of the owner of the subdivision, if I\nhad not begun in a friendly way, there would have been a great deal\nof difficulty in getting him to agree to the total liability.\u201d\nYears ago, when I was a barefoot boy walking through the woods to\na country school out in northwest Missouri, I read a fable about the\nsun and the wind. They quarreled about which was the stronger, and\nthe wind said, \u201cI\u2019ll prove I am. See the old man down there with a\ncoat? I bet I can get his coat off him quicker than you can.\u201d\nSo the sun went behind a cloud, and the wind blew until it was\nalmost a tornado, but the harder it blew, the tighter the old man\nclutched his coat to him.\nFinally, the wind calmed down and gave up, and then the sun\ncame out from behind the clouds and smiled kindly on the old man.\nPresently, he mopped his brow and pulled off his coat. The sun then\ntold the wind that gentleness and friendliness were always stronger\nthan fury and force.\nThe use of gentleness and friendliness is demonstrated day after\nday by people who have learned that a drop of honey catches more\nflies than a gallon of gall. F. Gale Connor of Lutherville, Maryland,\nproved this when he had to take his four-month-old car to the service\ndepartment of the car dealer for the third time. He told our class: \u201cIt\nwas apparent that talking to, reasoning with or shouting at the\nservice manager was not going to lead to a satisfactory resolution of\nmy problems.\n\u201cI walked over to the showroom and asked to see the agency\nowner, Mr. White. After a short wait, I was ushered into Mr. White\u2019s\noffice. I introduced myself and explained to him that I had bought my\ncar from his dealership because of the recommendations of friends\nwho had had previous dealings with him. I was told that his prices\nwere very competitive and his service was outstanding. He smiled\nwith satisfaction as he listened to me. I then explained the problem I\nwas having with the service department. \u2018I thought you might want to\nbe aware of any situation that might tarnish your fine reputation,\u2019 I\nadded. He thanked me for calling this to his attention and assured\nme that my problem would be taken care of. Not only did he\npersonally get involved, but he also lent me his car to use while mine\nwas being repaired.\u201d\nAesop was a Greek slave who lived at the court of Croesus and\nspun immortal fables six hundred years before Christ. Yet the truths\nhe taught about human nature are just as true in Boston and\nBirmingham now as they were twenty-six centuries ago in Athens.\nThe sun can make you take off your coat more quickly than the wind;\nand kindliness, the friendly approach and appreciation can make\npeople change their minds more readily than all the bluster and\nstorming in the world.\nRemember what Lincoln said: \u201cA drop of honey catches more flies\nthan a gallon of gall.\u201d\nPRINCIPLE 4\nBegin in a friendly way.\n5\nThe Secret of Socrates\nIn talking with people, don\u2019t begin by discussing the things on which\nyou differ. Begin by emphasizing\u2014and keep on emphasizing\u2014the\nthings on which you agree. Keep emphasizing, if possible, that you\nare both striving for the same end and that your only difference is\none of method and not of purpose.\nGet the other person saying \u201cYes, yes\u201d at the outset. Keep your\nopponent, if possible, from saying \u201cNo.\u201d\nA \u201cNo\u201d response, according to Professor Overstreet,* is a most\ndifficult handicap to overcome. When you have said \u201cNo,\u201d all your\npride of personality demands that you remain consistent with\nyourself. You may later feel that the \u201cNo\u201d was ill-advised;\nnevertheless, there is your precious pride to consider! Once having\nsaid a thing, you feel you must stick to it. Hence it is of the very\ngreatest importance that a person be started in the affirmative\ndirection.\nThe skillful speaker gets, at the outset, a number of \u201cYes\u201d\nresponses. This sets the psychological process of the listeners\nmoving in the affirmative direction. It is like the movement of a billiard\nball. Propel in one direction, and it takes some force to deflect it; far\nmore force to send it back in the opposite direction.\nThe psychological patterns here are quite clear. When a person\nsays \u201cNo\u201d and really means it, he or she is doing far more than\nsaying a word of two letters. The entire organism\u2014glandular,\nnervous, muscular\u2014gathers itself together into a condition of\nrejection. There is, usually in minute but sometimes in observable\ndegree, a physical withdrawal or readiness for withdrawal. The whole\nneuromuscular system, in short, sets itself on guard against\nacceptance. When, to the contrary, a person says \u201cYes,\u201d none of the\nwithdrawal activities takes place. The organism is in a forward\x02moving, accepting, open attitude. Hence the more \u201cYeses\u201d we can,\nat the very outset, induce, the more likely we are to succeed in\ncapturing the attention for our ultimate proposal.\nIt is a very simple technique\u2014this yes response. And yet, how\nmuch it is neglected! It often seems as if people get a sense of their\nown importance by antagonizing others at the outset.\nGet a student to say \u201cNo\u201d at the beginning, or a customer, child,\nhusband, or wife, and it takes the wisdom and the patience of angels\nto transform that bristling negative into an affirmative.\nThe use of this \u201cyes, yes\u201d technique enabled James Eberson, who\nwas a teller in the Greenwich Savings Bank, in New York City, to\nsecure a prospective customer who might otherwise have been lost.\n\u201cThis man came in to open an account,\u201d said Mr. Eberson, \u201cand I\ngave him our usual form to fill out. Some of the questions he\nanswered willingly, but there were others he flatly refused to answer.\n\u201cBefore I began the study of human relations, I would have told this\nprospective depositor that if he refused to give the bank this\ninformation, we should have to refuse to accept this account. I am\nashamed that I have been guilty of doing that very thing in the past.\nNaturally, an ultimatum like that made me feel good. I had shown\nwho was boss, that the bank\u2019s rules and regulations couldn\u2019t be\nflouted. But that sort of attitude certainly didn\u2019t give a feeling of\nwelcome and importance to the man who had walked in to give us\nhis patronage.\n\u201cI resolved this morning to use a little horse sense. I resolved not to\ntalk about what the bank wanted but about what the customer\nwanted. And above all else, I was determined to get him saying \u2018yes,\nyes\u2019 from the very start. So I agreed with him. I told him the\ninformation he refused to give was not absolutely necessary.\n\u201c\u2018However,\u2019 I said, \u2018suppose you have money in this bank at your\ndeath. Wouldn\u2019t you like to have the bank transfer it to your next of\nkin, who is entitled to it according to law?\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Yes, of course,\u2019 he replied.\n\u201c\u2018Don\u2019t you think,\u2019 I continued, \u2018that it would be a good idea to give\nus the name of your next of kin so that, in the event of your death,\nwe could carry out your wishes without error or delay?\u2019\n\u201cAgain he said, \u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u201cThe young man\u2019s attitude softened and changed when he realized\nthat we weren\u2019t asking for this information for our sake but for his\nsake. Before leaving the bank, this young man not only gave me\ncomplete information about himself but he opened, at my\nsuggestion, a trust account, naming his mother as the beneficiary for\nhis account, and he had gladly answered all the questions\nconcerning his mother also.\n\u201cI found that by getting him to say \u2018yes, yes\u2019 from the outset, he\nforgot the issue at stake and was happy to do all the things I\nsuggested.\u201d\nJoseph Allison, a sales representative for Westinghouse Electric\nCompany, had this story to tell: \u201cThere was a man in my territory that\nour company was most eager to sell to. My predecessor had called\non him for ten years without selling anything. When I took over the\nterritory, I called steadily for three years without getting an order.\nFinally, after thirteen years of calls and sales talk, we sold him a few\nmotors. If these proved to be all right, an order for several hundred\nmore would follow. Such was my expectation.\n\u201cRight? I knew they would be all right. So when I called three\nweeks later, I was in high spirits.\n\u201cThe chief engineer greeted me with this shocking announcement:\n\u2018Allison, I can\u2019t buy the remainder of the motors from you.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Why?\u2019 I asked in amazement. \u2018Why?\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Because your motors are too hot. I can\u2019t put my hand on them.\u2019\n\u201cI knew it wouldn\u2019t do any good to argue. I had tried that sort of\nthing too long. So I thought of getting the \u2018yes, yes,\u2019 response.\n\u201c\u2018Well, now look, Mr. Smith,\u2019 I said. \u2018I agree with you a hundred\npercent; if those motors are running too hot, you ought not to buy\nany more of them. You must have motors that won\u2019t run any hotter\nthan standards set by the National Electrical Manufacturers\nAssociation. Isn\u2019t that so?\u2019\n\u201cHe agreed it was. I had gotten my first \u2018yes.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018The Electrical Manufacturers Association regulations say that a\nproperly designed motor may have a temperature of 72 degrees\nFahrenheit above room temperature. Is that correct?\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Yes,\u2019 he agreed. \u2018That\u2019s quite correct. But your motors are much\nhotter.\u2019\n\u201cI didn\u2019t argue with him. I merely asked: \u2018How hot is the mill room?\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Oh,\u2019 he said, \u2018about 75 degrees Fahrenheit.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Well,\u2019 I replied, \u2018if the mill room is 75 degrees and you add 72 to\nthat, that makes a total of 147 degrees Fahrenheit. Wouldn\u2019t you\nscald your hand if you held it under a spigot of hot water at a\ntemperature of 147 degrees Fahrenheit?\u2019\n\u201cAgain he had to say \u2018yes.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Well,\u2019 I suggested, \u2018wouldn\u2019t it be a good idea to keep your hands\noff those motors?\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Well, I guess you\u2019re right,\u2019 he admitted. We continued to chat for a\nwhile. Then he called his secretary and lined up approximately\n$35,000 worth of business for the ensuing month.\n\u201cIt took me years and cost me countless thousands of dollars in\nlost business before I finally learned that it doesn\u2019t pay to argue, that\nit is much more profitable and much more interesting to look at\nthings from the other person\u2019s viewpoint and try to get that person\nsaying \u2018yes, yes.\u2019\u201d\nEddie Snow, who sponsors our courses in Oakland, California, tells\nhow he became a good customer of a shop because the proprietor\ngot him to say \u201cyes, yes.\u201d Eddie had become interested in bow\nhunting and had spent considerable money in purchasing equipment\nand supplies from a local bow store. When his brother was visiting\nhim he wanted to rent a bow for him from this store. The sales clerk\ntold him they didn\u2019t rent bows, so Eddie phoned another bow store.\nEddie described what happened:\n\u201cA very pleasant gentleman answered the phone. His response to\nmy question for a rental was completely different from the other\nplace. He said he was sorry but they no longer rented bows because\nthey couldn\u2019t afford to do so. He then asked me if I had rented\nbefore. I replied, \u2018Yes, several years ago.\u2019 He reminded me that I\nprobably paid $25 to $30 for the rental. I said \u2018yes\u2019 again. He then\nasked if I was the kind of person who liked to save money. Naturally,\nI answered \u2018yes.\u2019 He went on to explain that they had bow sets with\nall the necessary equipment on sale for $34.95. I could buy a\ncomplete set for only $4.95 more than I could rent one. He explained\nthat is why they had discontinued renting them. Did I think that was\nreasonable? My \u2018yes\u2019 response led to a purchase of the set, and\nwhen I picked it up I purchased several more items at this shop and\nhave since become a regular customer.\u201d\nSocrates, \u201cthe gadfly of Athens,\u201d was one of the greatest\nphilosophers the world has ever known. He did something that only a\nhandful of men in all history have been able to do: he sharply\nchanged the whole course of human thought; and now, twenty-four\ncenturies after his death, he is honored as one of the wisest\npersuaders who ever influenced this wrangling world.\nHis method? Did he tell people they were wrong? Oh, no, not\nSocrates. He was far too adroit for that. His whole technique, now\ncalled the \u201cSocratic method,\u201d was based upon getting a \u201cyes, yes\u201d\nresponse. He asked questions with which his opponent would have\nto agree. He kept on winning one admission after another until he\nhad an armful of yeses. He kept on asking questions until finally,\nalmost without realizing it, his opponents found themselves\nembracing a conclusion they would have bitterly denied a few\nminutes previously.\nThe next time we are tempted to tell someone he or she is wrong,\nlet\u2019s remember old Socrates and ask a gentle question\u2014a question\nthat will get the \u201cyes, yes\u201d response.\nThe Chinese have a proverb pregnant with the age-old wisdom of\nthe Orient: \u201cHe who treads softly goes far.\u201d\nThey have spent five thousand years studying human nature,\nthose cultured Chinese, and they have garnered a lot of perspicacity:\n\u201cHe who treads softly goes far.\u201d\nPRINCIPLE 5\nGet the other person saying \u201cyes, yes\u201d\nimmediately."),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},"Harry A. Overstreet, Influencing Human Behavior (New York:\nNorton, 1925).\n6\nThe Safety Valve in Handling Complaints\nMost people trying to win others to their way of thinking do too much\ntalking themselves. Let the other people talk themselves out. They\nknow more about their business and problems than you do. So ask\nthem questions. Let them tell you a few things.\nIf you disagree with them you may be tempted to interrupt. But\ndon\u2019t. It is dangerous. They won\u2019t pay attention to you while they still\nhave a lot of ideas of their own crying for expression. So listen\npatiently and with an open mind. Be sincere about it. Encourage\nthem to express their ideas fully.\nDoes this policy pay in business? Let\u2019s see. Here is the story of a\nsales representative who was forced to try it.\nOne of the largest automobile manufacturers in the United States\nwas negotiating for a year\u2019s requirements of upholstery fabrics.\nThree important manufacturers had worked up fabrics in sample\nbodies. These had all been inspected by the executives of the motor\ncompany, and notice had been sent to each manufacturer saying\nthat, on a certain day, a representative from each supplier would be\ngiven an opportunity to make a final plea for the contract.\nG.B.R., a representative of one manufacturer, arrived in town with\na severe attack of laryngitis. \u201cWhen it came my turn to meet the\nexecutives in conference,\u201d Mr. R\u2014\u2014 said as he related the story\nbefore one of my classes, \u201cI had lost my voice. I could hardly\nwhisper. I was ushered into a room and found myself face to face\nwith the textile engineer, the purchasing agent, the director of sales\nand the president of the company. I stood up and made a valiant\neffort to speak, but I couldn\u2019t do anything more than squeak.\n\u201cThey were all seated around a table, so I wrote on a pad of paper:\n\u2018Gentlemen, I have lost my voice. I am speechless.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018I\u2019ll do the talking for you,\u2019 the president said. He did. He exhibited\nmy samples and praised their good points. A lively discussion arose\nabout the merits of my goods. And the president, since he was\ntalking for me, took the position I would have had during the\ndiscussion. My sole participation consisted of smiles, nods and a few\ngestures.\n\u201cAs a result of this unique conference, I was awarded the contract,\nwhich called for over half a million yards of upholstery fabrics at an\naggregate value of $1,600,000\u2014the biggest order I had ever\nreceived.\n\u201cI know I would have lost the contract if I hadn\u2019t lost my voice,\nbecause I had the wrong idea about the whole proposition. I\ndiscovered, quite by accident, how richly it sometimes pays to let the\nother person do the talking.\u201d\nLetting the other person do the talking helps in family situations as\nwell as in business. Barbara Wilson\u2019s relationship with her daughter,\nLaurie, was deteriorating rapidly. Laurie, who had been a quiet,\ncomplacent child, had grown into an uncooperative, sometimes\nbelligerent teenager. Mrs. Wilson lectured her, threatened her and\npunished her, but all to no avail.\n\u201cOne day,\u201d Mrs. Wilson told one of our classes, \u201cI just gave up.\nLaurie had disobeyed me and had left the house to visit her girl\nfriend before she had completed her chores. When she returned I\nwas about to scream at her for the ten-thousandth time, but I just\ndidn\u2019t have the strength to do it. I just looked at her and said sadly,\n\u2018Why, Laurie, why?\u2019\n\u201cLaurie noted my condition and in a calm voice asked, \u2018Do you\nreally want to know?\u2019 I nodded and Laurie told me, first hesitantly,\nand then it all flowed out. I had never listened to her. I was always\ntelling her to do this or that. When she wanted to tell me her\nthoughts, feelings, ideas, I interrupted with more orders. I began to\nrealize that she needed me\u2014not as a bossy mother, but as a\nconfidante, an outlet for all her confusion about growing up. And all I\nhad been doing was talking when I should have been listening. I\nnever heard her.\n\u201cFrom that time on I let her do all the talking she wanted. She tells\nme what is on her mind, and our relationship has improved\nimmeasurably. She is again a cooperative person.\u201d\nA large advertisement appeared on the financial page of a New\nYork newspaper calling for a person with unusual ability and\nexperience. Charles T. Cubellis answered the advertisement,\nsending his reply to a box number. A few days later, he was invited\nby letter to call for an interview. Before he called, he spent hours in\nWall Street finding out everything possible about the person who had\nfounded the business. During the interview, he remarked: \u201cI should\nbe mighty proud to be associated with an organization with a record\nlike yours. I understand you started twenty-eight years ago with\nnothing but desk room and one stenographer. Is that true?\u201d\nAlmost every successful person likes to reminisce about his early\nstruggles. This man was no exception. He talked for a long time\nabout how he had started with $450 in cash and an original idea. He\ntold how he had fought against discouragement and battled against\nridicule, working Sundays and holidays, twelve to sixteen hours a\nday; how he had finally won against all odds until now the most\nimportant executives on Wall Street were coming to him for\ninformation and guidance. He was proud of such a record. He had a\nright to be, and he had a splendid time telling about it. Finally, he\nquestioned Mr. Cubellis briefly about his experience, then called in\none of his vice presidents and said: \u201cI think this is the person we are\nlooking for.\u201d\nMr. Cubellis had taken the trouble to find out about the\naccomplishments of his prospective employer. He showed an\ninterest in the other person and his problems. He encouraged the\nother person to do most of the talking\u2014and made a favorable\nimpression.\nRoy G. Bradley of Sacramento, California, had the opposite\nproblem. He listened as a good prospect for a sales position talked\nhimself into a job with Bradley\u2019s firm. Roy reported:\n\u201cBeing a small brokerage firm, we had no fringe benefits, such as\nhospitalization, medical insurance and pensions. Every\nrepresentative is an independent agent. We don\u2019t even provide leads\nfor prospects, as we cannot advertise for them as our larger\ncompetitors do.\n\u201cRichard Pryor had the type of experience we wanted for this\nposition, and he was interviewed first by my assistant, who told him\nabout all the negatives related to this job. He seemed slightly\ndiscouraged when he came into my office. I mentioned the one\nbenefit of being associated with my firm, that of being an\nindependent contractor and therefore virtually being self-employed.\n\u201cAs he talked about these advantages to me, he talked himself out\nof each negative thought he had when he came in for the interview.\nSeveral times it seemed as though he was half talking to himself as\nhe was thinking through each thought. At times I was tempted to add\nto his thoughts; however, as the interview came to a close I felt he\nhad convinced himself, very much on his own, that he would like to\nwork for my firm.\n\u201cBecause I had been a good listener and let Dick do most of the\ntalking, he was able to weigh both sides fairly in his mind, and he\ncame to the positive conclusion, which was a challenge he created\nfor himself. We hired him and he has been an outstanding\nrepresentative for our firm.\u201d\nEven our friends would much rather talk to us about their\nachievements than listen to us boast about ours.\nLa Rochefoucauld, the French philosopher, said: \u201cIf you want\nenemies, excel your friends; but if you want friends, let your friends\nexcel you.\u201d\nWhy is that true? Because when our friends excel us, they feel\nimportant; but when we excel them, they\u2014or at least some of them\n\u2014will feel inferior and envious.\nBy far the best-liked placement counselor in the Midtown\nPersonnel Agency in New York City was Henrietta G\u2014\u2014. It hadn\u2019t\nalways been that way. During the first few months of her association\nwith the agency, Henrietta didn\u2019t have a single friend among her\ncolleagues. Why? Because every day she would brag about the\nplacements she had made, the new accounts she had opened, and\nanything else she had accomplished.\n\u201cI was good at my work and proud of it,\u201d Henrietta told one of our\nclasses. \u201cBut instead of my colleagues sharing my triumphs, they\nseemed to resent them. I wanted to be liked by these people. I really\nwanted them to be my friends. After listening to some of the\nsuggestions made in this course, I started to talk about myself less\nand listen more to my associates. They also had things to boast\nabout and were more excited about telling me about their\naccomplishments than about listening to my boasting. Now, when we\nhave some time to chat, I ask them to share their joys with me, and I\nonly mention my achievements when they ask.\u201d\nPRINCIPLE 6\nLet the other person do a great deal of the\ntalking.\n7\nHow to Get Cooperation\nDon\u2019t you have much more faith in ideas that you discover for\nyourself than in ideas that are handed to you on a silver platter?

As they talked, he wrote their ideas on the\nblackboard. He then said: \u201cI\u2019ll give you all these qualities you expect\nfrom me. Now I want you to tell me what I have a right to expect from\nyou.\u201d The replies came quick and fast: loyalty, honesty, initiative,\noptimism, teamwork, eight hours a day of enthusiastic work. The\nmeeting ended with a new courage, a new inspiration\u2014one\nsalesperson volunteered to work fourteen hours a day\u2014and Mr.\nSeltz reported to me that the increase of sales was phenomenal.\n\u201cThe people had made a sort of moral bargain with me,\u201d said Mr.\nSeltz, \u201cand as long as I lived up to my part in it, they were\ndetermined to live up to theirs. Consulting them about their wishes\nand desires was just the shot in the arm they needed.\u201d\nNo one likes to feel that he or she is being sold something or told\nto do a thing. We much prefer to feel that we are buying of our own\naccord or acting on our own ideas. We like to be consulted about our\nwishes, our wants, our thoughts.\nTake the case of Eugene Wesson. He lost countless thousands of\ndollars in commissions before he learned this truth. Mr. Wesson sold\nsketches for a studio that created designs for stylists and textile\nmanufacturers. Mr. Wesson had called on one of the leading stylists\nin New York once a week, every week for three years. \u201cHe never\nrefused to see me,\u201d said Mr. Wesson, \u201cbut he never bought. He\nalways looked over my sketches very carefully and then said: \u2018No,\nWesson, I guess we don\u2019t get together today.\u2019\u201d\nAfter 150 failures, Wesson realized he must be in a mental rut, so\nhe resolved to devote one evening a week to the study of influencing\nhuman behavior, to help him develop new ideas and generate new\nenthusiasm.\nHe decided on this new approach. With half a dozen unfinished\nartists\u2019 sketches under his arm, he rushed over to the buyer\u2019s office.\n\u201cI want you to do me a little favor, if you will,\u201d he said. \u201cHere are\nsome uncompleted sketches. Won\u2019t you please tell me how we could\nfinish them up in such a way that you could use them?\u201d\nThe buyer looked at the sketches for a while without uttering a\nword. Finally he said: \u201cLeave these with me for a few days, Wesson,\nand then come back and see me.\u201d\nWesson returned three days later, got his suggestions, took the\nsketches back to the studio and had them finished according to the\nbuyer\u2019s ideas. The result? All accepted.\nAfter that, this buyer ordered scores of other sketches from\nWesson, all drawn according to the buyer\u2019s ideas. \u201cI realized why I\nhad failed for years to sell him,\u201d said Mr. Wesson. \u201cI had urged him to\nbuy what I thought he ought to have. Then I changed my approach\ncompletely. I urged him to give me his ideas. This made him feel that\nhe was creating the designs. And he was. I didn\u2019t have to sell him.\nHe bought.\u201d\nLetting the other person feel that the idea is his or hers not only\nworks in business and politics, it works in family life as well. Paul M.\nDavis of Tulsa, Oklahoma, told his class how he applied this\nprinciple:\n\u201cMy family and I enjoyed one of the most interesting sightseeing\nvacation trips we have ever taken. I had long dreamed of visiting\nsuch historic sites as the Civil War battlefield in Gettysburg,\nIndependence Hall in Philadelphia, and our nation\u2019s capital. Valley\nForge, Jamestown and the restored colonial village of Williamsburg\nwere high on the list of things I wanted to see.\n\u201cIn March my wife, Nancy, mentioned that she had ideas for our\nsummer vacation which included a tour of the western states, visiting\npoints of interest in New Mexico, Arizona, California and Nevada.\nShe had wanted to make this trip for several years. But we couldn\u2019t\nobviously make both trips.\n\u201cOur daughter, Anne, had just completed a course in U.S. history in\njunior high school and had become very interested in the events that\nhad shaped our country\u2019s growth. I asked her how she would like to\nvisit the places she had learned about on our next vacation. She said\nshe would love to.\n\u201cTwo evenings later as we sat around the dinner table, Nancy\nannounced that if we all agreed, the summer\u2019s vacation would be to\nthe eastern states, that it would be a great trip for Anne and thrilling\nfor all of us. We all concurred.\u201d\nThis same psychology was used by an X-ray manufacturer to sell\nhis equipment to one of the largest hospitals in Brooklyn. This\nhospital was building an addition and preparing to equip it with the\nfinest X-ray department in America. Dr. L\u2014\u2014, who was in charge of\nthe X-ray department, was overwhelmed with sales representatives,\neach caroling the praises of his own company\u2019s equipment.\nOne manufacturer, however, was more skillful. He knew far more\nabout handling human nature than the others did. He wrote a letter\nsomething like this:\nOur factory has recently completed a new line of X-ray\nequipment. The first shipment of these machines has just arrived\nat our office. They are not perfect. We know that, and we want to\nimprove them. So we should be deeply obligated to you if you\ncould find time to look them over and give us your ideas about\nhow they can be made more serviceable to your profession.\nKnowing how occupied you are, I shall be glad to send my car\nfor you at any hour you specify.\n\u201cI was surprised to get that letter,\u201d Dr. L\u2014\u2014 said as he related the\nincident before the class. \u201cI was both surprised and complimented. I\nhad never had an X-ray manufacturer seeking my advice before. It\nmade me feel important. I was busy every night that week, but I\ncanceled a dinner appointment in order to look over the equipment.\nThe more I studied it, the more I discovered for myself how much I\nliked it.\n\u201cNobody had tried to sell it to me. I felt that the idea of buying that\nequipment for the hospital was my own. I sold myself on its superior\nqualities and ordered it installed.\u201d\nRalph Waldo Emerson in his essay \u201cSelf-Reliance\u201d stated: \u201cIn\nevery work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts; they\ncome back to us with a certain alienated majesty.\u201d\nColonel Edward M. House wielded an enormous influence in\nnational and international affairs while Woodrow Wilson occupied the\nWhite House. Wilson leaned upon Colonel House for secret counsel\nand advice more than he did upon even members of his own\ncabinet.\nWhat method did the Colonel use in influencing the President?\nFortunately, we know, for House himself revealed it to Arthur D.\nHowden Smith, and Smith quoted House in an article in The\nSaturday Evening Post.\n\u201c\u2018After I got to know the President,\u2019 House said, \u2018I learned the best\nway to convert him to an idea was to plant it in his mind casually, but\nso as to interest him in it\u2014so as to get him thinking about it on his\nown account. The first time this worked it was an accident. I had\nbeen visiting him at the White House and urged a policy on him\nwhich he appeared to disapprove. But several days later, at the\ndinner table, I was amazed to hear him trot out my suggestion as his\nown.\u2019\u201d\nDid House interrupt him and say, \u201cThat\u2019s not your idea. That\u2019s\nmine\u201d? Oh, no. Not House. He was too adroit for that. He didn\u2019t care\nabout credit. He wanted results. So he let Wilson continue to feel\nthat the idea was his. House did even more than that. He gave\nWilson public credit for these ideas.\nLet\u2019s remember that everyone we come in contact with is just as\nhuman as Woodrow Wilson. So let\u2019s use Colonel House\u2019s technique.\nA man up in the beautiful Canadian province of New Brunswick\nused this technique on me and won my patronage. I was planning at\nthe time to do some fishing and canoeing in New Brunswick. So I\nwrote the tourist bureau for information. Evidently my name and\naddress were put on a mailing list, for I was immediately\noverwhelmed with scores of letters and booklets and printed\ntestimonials from camps and guides. I was bewildered. I didn\u2019t know\nwhich to choose. Then one camp owner did a clever thing. He sent\nme the names and telephone numbers of several New York people\nwho had stayed at his camp and he invited me to telephone them\nand discover for myself what he had to offer.\nI found to my surprise that I knew one of the men on his list. I\ntelephoned him, found out what his experience had been, and then\nwired the camp the date of my arrival.\nThe others had been trying to sell me on their service, but one let\nme sell myself. That organization won.\nTwenty-five centuries ago, Lao-tse, a Chinese sage, said some\nthings that readers of this book might use today:\n\u201cThe reason why rivers and seas receive the homage of a hundred\nmountain streams is that they keep below them. Thus they are able\nto reign over all the mountain streams. So the sage, wishing to be\nabove men, putteth himself below them; wishing to be before them,\nhe putteth himself behind them. Thus, though his place be above\nmen, they do not feel his weight; though his place be before them,\nthey do not count it an injury.\u201d\nPRINCIPLE 7\nLet the other person feel that the idea is his or\nhers.\n8\nA Formula That Will Work Wonders for You\nRemember that other people may be totally wrong. But they don\u2019t\nthink so. Don\u2019t condemn them. Any fool can do that. Try to\nunderstand them. Only wise, tolerant, exceptional people even try to\ndo that.\nThere is a reason why the other man thinks and acts as he does.\nFerret out that reason\u2014and you have the key to his actions, perhaps\nto his personality.\nTry honestly to put yourself in his place.\nIf you say to yourself, \u201cHow would I feel, how would I react if I were\nin his shoes?\u201d you will save yourself time and irritation, for \u201cby\nbecoming interested in the cause, we are less likely to dislike the\neffect.\u201d And, in addition, you will sharply increase your skill in human\nrelationships.\n\u201cStop a minute,\u201d says Kenneth M. Goode in his book How to Turn\nPeople Into Gold, \u201cstop a minute to contrast your keen interest in\nyour own affairs with your mild concern about anything else. Realize\nthen, that everybody else in the world feels exactly the same way!\nThen, along with Lincoln and Roosevelt, you will have grasped the\nonly solid foundation for interpersonal relationships; namely, that\nsuccess in dealing with people depends on a sympathetic grasp of\nthe other person\u2019s viewpoint.\u201d\nSam Douglas of Hempstead, New York, used to tell his wife that\nshe spent too much time working on their lawn, pulling weeds,\nfertilizing, cutting the grass twice a week when the lawn didn\u2019t look\nany better than it had when they moved into their home four years\nearlier. Naturally, she was distressed by his remarks, and each time\nhe made such remarks the balance of the evening was ruined.\nAfter taking our course, Mr. Douglas realized how foolish he had\nbeen all those years. It never occurred to him that she enjoyed doing\nthat work and she might really appreciate a compliment on her\ndiligence.\nOne evening after dinner, his wife said she wanted to pull some\nweeds and invited him to keep her company. He first declined, but\nthen thought better of it and went out after her and began to help her\npull weeds. She was visibly pleased, and together they spent an\nhour in hard work and pleasant conversation.\nAfter that he often helped her with the gardening and\ncomplimented her on how fine the lawn looked, what a fantastic job\nshe was doing with a yard where the soil was like concrete. Result: a\nhappier life for both because he had learned to look at things from\nher point of view\u2014even if the subject was only weeds.\nIn his book Getting Through to People, Dr. Gerald S. Nirenberg\ncommented: \u201cCooperativeness in conversation is achieved when you\nshow that you consider the other person\u2019s ideas and feelings as\nimportant as your own. Starting your conversation by giving the other\nperson the purpose or direction of your conversation, governing what\nyou say by what you would want to hear if you were the listener, and\naccepting his or her viewpoint will encourage the listener to have an\nopen mind to your ideas.\u201d*\nI have always enjoyed walking and riding in a park near my home.\nLike the Druids of ancient Gaul, I all but worship an oak tree, so I\nwas distressed season after season to see the young trees and\nshrubs killed off by needless fires. These fires weren\u2019t caused by\ncareless smokers. They were almost all caused by youngsters who\nwent out to the park to go native and cook a frankfurter or an egg\nunder the trees. Sometimes, these fires raged so fiercely that the fire\ndepartment had to be called out to fight the conflagration.\nThere was a sign on the edge of the park saying that anyone who\nstarted a fire was liable to fine and imprisonment, but the sign stood\nin an unfrequented part of the park, and few of the culprits ever saw\nit. A mounted policeman was supposed to look after the park; but he\ndidn\u2019t take his duties too seriously, and the fires continued to spread\nseason after season. On one occasion, I rushed up to a policeman\nand told him about a fire spreading rapidly through the park and\nwanted him to notify the fire department, and he nonchalantly replied\nthat it was none of his business because it wasn\u2019t in his precinct! I\nwas desperate, so after that when I went riding, I acted as a self\x02appointed committee of one to protect the public domain. In the\nbeginning, I am afraid I didn\u2019t even attempt to see the other people\u2019s\npoint of view. When I saw a fire blazing under the trees, I was so\nunhappy about it, so eager to do the right thing, that I did the wrong\nthing. I would ride up to the boys, warn them that they could be jailed\nfor starting a fire, order with a tone of authority that it be put out; and,\nif they refused, I would threaten to have them arrested. I was merely\nunloading my feelings without thinking of their point of view.\nThe result? They obeyed\u2014obeyed sullenly and with resentment.\nAfter I rode on over the hill, they probably rebuilt the fire and longed\nto burn up the whole park.\nWith the passing of the years, I acquired a trifle more knowledge of\nhuman relations, a little more tact, a somewhat greater tendency to\nsee things from the other person\u2019s standpoint. Then, instead of\ngiving orders, I would ride up to a blazing fire and begin something\nlike this:\n\u201cHaving a good time, boys? What are you going to cook for\nsupper? . . . I loved to build fires myself when I was a boy\u2014and I still\nlove to. But you know they are very dangerous here in the park. I\nknow you boys don\u2019t mean to do any harm, but other boys aren\u2019t so\ncareful. They come along and see that you have built a fire; so they\nbuild one and don\u2019t put it out when they go home and it spreads\namong the dry leaves and kills the trees. We won\u2019t have any trees\nhere at all if we aren\u2019t more careful. You could be put in jail for\nbuilding this fire. But I don\u2019t want to be bossy and interfere with your\npleasure. I like to see you enjoy yourselves; but won\u2019t you please\nrake all the leaves away from the fire right now\u2014and you\u2019ll be careful\nto cover it with dirt, a lot of dirt, before you leave, won\u2019t you? And the\nnext time you want to have some fun, won\u2019t you please build your\nfire over the hill there in the sandpit? It can\u2019t do any harm there. . . .\nThanks so much, boys. Have a good time.\u201d\nWhat a difference that kind of talk made! It made the boys want to\ncooperate. No sullenness, no resentment. They hadn\u2019t been forced\nto obey orders. They had saved their faces. They felt better and I felt\nbetter because I had handled the situation with consideration for\ntheir point of view.\nSeeing things through another person\u2019s eyes may ease tensions\nwhen personal problems become overwhelming. Elizabeth Novak of\nNew South Wales, Australia, was six weeks late with her car\npayment. \u201cOn a Friday,\u201d she reported, \u201cI received a nasty phone call\nfrom the man who was handling my account informing me if I did not\ncome up with $122 by Monday morning I could anticipate further\naction from the company. I had no way of raising the money over the\nweekend, so when I received his phone call first thing on Monday\nmorning I expected the worst. Instead of becoming upset I looked at\nthe situation from his point of view. I apologized most sincerely for\ncausing him so much inconvenience and remarked that I must be his\nmost troublesome customer as this was not the first time I was\nbehind in my payments. His tone of voice changed immediately, and\nhe reassured me that I was far from being one of his really\ntroublesome customers. He went on to tell me several examples of\nhow rude his customers sometimes were, how they lied to him and\noften tried to avoid talking to him at all. I said nothing. I listened and\nlet him pour out his troubles to me. Then, without any suggestion\nfrom me, he said it did not matter if I couldn\u2019t pay all the money\nimmediately. It would be all right if I paid him $20 by the end of the\nmonth and made up the balance whenever it was convenient for me\nto do so.\u201d\nTomorrow, before asking anyone to put out a fire or buy your\nproduct or contribute to your favorite charity, why not pause and\nclose your eyes and try to think the whole thing through from another\nperson\u2019s point of view? Ask yourself: \u201cWhy should he or she want to\ndo it?\u201d True, this will take time, but it will avoid making enemies and\nwill get better results\u2014and with less friction and less shoe leather.\n\u201cI would rather walk the sidewalk in front of a person\u2019s office for two\nhours before an interview,\u201d said Dean Donham of the Harvard\nBusiness School, \u201cthan step into that office without a perfectly clear\nidea of what I was going to say and what that person\u2014from my\nknowledge of his or her interests and motives\u2014was likely to answer.\u201d\nThat is so important that I am going to repeat it in italics for the\nsake of emphasis.\nI would rather walk the sidewalk in front of a person\u2019s office for two\nhours before an interview than step into that office without a perfectly\nclear idea of what I was going to say and what that person\u2014from my\nknowledge of his or her interests and motives\u2014was likely to answer.\nIf, as a result of reading this book, you get only one thing\u2014an\nincreased tendency to think always in terms of the other person\u2019s\npoint of view, and see things from that person\u2019s angle as well as your\nown\u2014if you get only that one thing from this book, it may easily\nprove to be one of the stepping-stones of your career.\nPRINCIPLE 8\nTry honestly to see things from the other\nperson\u2019s point of view."),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},"Dr. Gerald S. Nirenberg, Getting Through to People (Englewood\nCliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1963), p. 31.\n9\nWhat Everybody Wants\nWouldn\u2019t you like to have a magic phrase that would stop arguments,\neliminate ill feeling, create good will, and make the other person\nlisten attentively?\nYes? All right. Here it is: \u201cI don\u2019t blame you one iota for feeling as\nyou do. If I were you I would undoubtedly feel just as you do.\u201d\nAn answer like that will soften the most cantankerous old cuss\nalive. And you can say that and be 100 percent sincere, because if\nyou were the other person you, of course, would feel just as he does.\nTake Al Capone, for example. Suppose you had inherited the same\nbody and temperament and mind that Al Capone had. Suppose you\nhad had his environment and experiences. You would then be\nprecisely what he was\u2014and where he was. For it is those things\u2014\nand only those things\u2014that made him what he was. The only\nreason, for example, that you are not a rattlesnake is that your\nmother and father weren\u2019t rattlesnakes.\nYou deserve very little credit for being what you are\u2014and\nremember, the people who come to you irritated, bigoted,\nunreasoning, deserve very little discredit for being what they are.\nFeel sorry for the poor devils. Pity them. Sympathize with them. Say\nto yourself: \u201cThere, but for the grace of God, go I.\u201d\nThree-fourths of the people you will ever meet are hungering and\nthirsting for sympathy. Give it to them, and they will love you.\nI once gave a broadcast about the author of Little Women, Louisa\nMay Alcott. Naturally, I knew she had lived and written her immortal\nbooks in Concord, Massachusetts. But, without thinking what I was\nsaying, I spoke of visiting her old home in Concord, New Hampshire.\nIf I had said New Hampshire only once, it might have been forgiven.\nBut, alas and alack! I said it twice. I was deluged with letters and\ntelegrams, stinging messages that swirled around my defenseless\nhead like a swarm of hornets. Many were indignant. A few insulting.\nOne Colonial Dame, who had been reared in Concord,\nMassachusetts, and who was then living in Philadelphia, vented her\nscorching wrath upon me. She couldn\u2019t have been much more bitter\nif I had accused Miss Alcott of being a cannibal from New Guinea.\nAs I read the letter, I said to myself, \u201cThank God, I am not married to\nthat woman.\u201d I felt like writing and telling her that although I had\nmade a mistake in geography, she had made a far greater mistake in\ncommon courtesy. That was to be just my opening sentence. Then I\nwas going to roll up my sleeves and tell her what I really thought. But\nI didn\u2019t. I controlled myself. I realized that any hotheaded fool could\ndo that\u2014and that most fools would do just that.\nI wanted to be above fools. So I resolved to try to turn her hostility\ninto friendliness. It would be a challenge, a sort of game I could play.\nI said to myself, \u201cAfter all, if I were she, I would probably feel just as\nshe does.\u201d So, I determined to sympathize with her viewpoint. The\nnext time I was in Philadelphia, I called her on the telephone. The\nconversation went something like this:\nME: Mrs. So-and-So, you wrote me a letter a few weeks ago,\nand I want to thank you for it.\nSHE: (in incisive, cultured, well-bred tones): To whom have I the\nhonor of speaking?\nME: I am a stranger to you. My name is Dale Carnegie. You\nlistened to a broadcast I gave about Louisa May Alcott a few\nSundays ago, and I made the unforgivable blunder of saying\nthat she had lived in Concord, New Hampshire. It was a\nstupid blunder, and I want to apologize for it. It was so nice of\nyou to take the time to write me.\nSHE: I am sorry, Mr. Carnegie, that I wrote as I did. I lost my\ntemper. I must apologize.\nME: No! No! You are not the one to apologize; I am. Any school\nchild would have known better than to have said what I said.\nI apologized over the air the following Sunday, and I want to\napologize to you personally now.\nSHE: I was born in Concord, Massachusetts. My family has been\nprominent in Massachusetts affairs for two centuries, and I\nam very proud of my native state. I was really quite\ndistressed to hear you say that Miss Alcott had lived in New\nHampshire. But I am really ashamed of that letter.\nME: I assure you that you were not one-tenth as distressed as I\nam. My error didn\u2019t hurt Massachusetts, but it did hurt me. It\nis so seldom that people of your standing and culture take\nthe time to write people who speak on the radio, and I do\nhope you will write me again if you detect an error in my\ntalks.\nSHE: You know, I really like very much the way you have\naccepted my criticism. You must be a very nice person. I\nshould like to know you better.\nSo, because I had apologized and sympathized with her point of\nview, she began apologizing and sympathizing with my point of view.\nI had the satisfaction of controlling my temper, the satisfaction of\nreturning kindness for an insult. I got infinitely more real fun out of\nmaking her like me than I could ever have gotten out of telling her to\ngo and take a jump in the Schuylkill River.\nEvery man who occupies the White House is faced almost daily\nwith thorny problems in human relations. President Taft was no\nexception, and he learned from experience the enormous chemical\nvalue of sympathy in neutralizing the acid of hard feelings. In his\nbook Ethics in Service, Taft gives rather an amusing illustration of\nhow he softened the ire of a disappointed and ambitious mother.\n\u201cA lady in Washington,\u201d wrote Taft, \u201cwhose husband had some\npolitical influence, came and labored with me for six weeks or more\nto appoint her son to a position. She secured the aid of Senators and\nCongressmen in formidable number and came with them to see that\nthey spoke with emphasis. The place was one requiring technical\nqualification, and following the recommendation of the head of the\nBureau, I appointed somebody else. I then received a letter from the\nmother, saying that I was most ungrateful, since I declined to make\nher a happy woman as I could have done by a turn of my hand. She\ncomplained further that she had labored with her state delegation\nand got all the votes for an administration bill in which I was\nespecially interested and this was the way I had rewarded her.\n\u201cWhen you get a letter like that, the first thing you do is to think how\nyou can be severe with a person who has committed an impropriety,\nor even been a little impertinent. Then you may compose an answer.\nThen if you are wise, you will put the letter in a drawer and lock the\ndrawer. Take it out in the course of two days\u2014such communications\nwill always bear two days\u2019 delay in answering\u2014and when you take it\nout after that interval, you will not send it. That is just the course I\ntook. After that, I sat down and wrote her just as polite a letter as I\ncould, telling her I realized a mother\u2019s disappointment under such\ncircumstances, but that really the appointment was not left to my\nmere personal preference, that I had to select a man with technical\nqualifications, and had, therefore, to follow the recommendations of\nthe head of the Bureau. I expressed the hope that her son would go\non to accomplish what she had hoped for him in the position which\nhe then had. That mollified her and she wrote me a note saying she\nwas sorry she had written as she had.\n\u201cBut the appointment I sent in was not confirmed at once, and after\nan interval I received a letter which purported to come from her\nhusband, though it was in the same handwriting as all the others. I\nwas therein advised that, due to the nervous prostration that had\nfollowed her disappointment in this case, she had to take to her bed\nand had developed a most serious case of cancer of the stomach.\nWould I not restore her to health by withdrawing the first name and\nreplacing it by her son\u2019s? I had to write another letter, this one to the\nhusband, to say that I hoped the diagnosis would prove to be\ninaccurate, that I sympathized with him in the sorrow he must have\nin the serious illness of his wife, but that it was impossible to\nwithdraw the name sent in. The man whom I appointed was\nconfirmed, and within two days after I received that letter, we gave a\nmusicale at the White House. The first two people to greet Mrs. Taft\nand me were this husband and wife, though the wife had so recently\nbeen in articulo mortis.\u201d\nJay Mangum represented an elevator-escalator maintenance\ncompany in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which had the maintenance contract\nfor the escalators in one of Tulsa\u2019s leading hotels. The hotel\nmanager did not want to shut down the escalator for more than two\nhours at a time because he did not want to inconvenience the hotel\u2019s\nguests. The repair that had to be made would take at least eight\nhours, and his company did not always have a specially qualified\nmechanic available at the convenience of the hotel.\nWhen Mr. Mangum was able to schedule a top-flight mechanic for\nthis job, he telephoned the hotel manager and instead of arguing\nwith him to give him the necessary time, he said:\n\u201cRick, I know your hotel is quite busy and you would like to keep\nthe escalator shutdown time to a minimum. I understand your\nconcern about this, and we want to do everything possible to\naccommodate you. However, our diagnosis of the situation shows\nthat if we do not do a complete job now, your escalator may suffer\nmore serious damage and that would cause a much longer\nshutdown. I know you would not want to inconvenience your guests\nfor several days.\u201d\nThe manager had to agree that an eight-hour shutdown was more\ndesirable than several days\u2019. By sympathizing with the manager\u2019s\ndesire to keep his patrons happy, Mr. Mangum was able to win the\nhotel manager to his way of thinking easily and without rancor.\nJoyce Norris, a piano teacher in St. Louis, Missouri, told of how\nshe had handled a problem piano teachers often have with teenage\ngirls. Babette had exceptionally long fingernails. This is a serious\nhandicap to anyone who wants to develop proper piano-playing\nhabits.\nMrs. Norris reported: \u201cI knew her long fingernails would be a barrier\nfor her in her desire to play well. During our discussions prior to her\nstarting her lessons with me, I did not mention anything to her about\nher nails. I didn\u2019t want to discourage her from taking lessons, and I\nalso knew she would not want to lose that which she took so much\npride in and such great care to make attractive.\n\u201cAfter her first lesson, when I felt the time was right, I said:\n\u2018Babette, you have attractive hands and beautiful fingernails. If you\nwant to play the piano as well as you are capable of and as well as\nyou would like to, you would be surprised how much quicker and\neasier it would be for you, if you would trim your nails shorter. Just\nthink about it, okay?\u2019 She made a face which was definitely negative.\nI also talked to her mother about this situation, again mentioning how\nlovely her nails were. Another negative reaction. It was obvious that\nBabette\u2019s beautifully manicured nails were important to her.\n\u201cThe following week Babette returned for her second lesson. Much\nto my surprise, the fingernails had been trimmed. I complimented her\nand praised her for making such a sacrifice. I also thanked her\nmother for influencing Babette to cut her nails. Her reply was \u2018Oh, I\nhad nothing to do with it. Babette decided to do it on her own, and\nthis is the first time she has ever trimmed her nails for anyone.\u2019\u201d\nDid Mrs. Norris threaten Babette? Did she say she would refuse to\nteach a student with long fingernails? No, she did not. She let\nBabette know that her fingernails were a thing of beauty and it would\nbe a sacrifice to cut them. She implied, \u201cI sympathize with you\u2014I\nknow it won\u2019t be easy, but it will pay off in your better musical\ndevelopment.\u201d\nSol Hurok was probably America\u2019s number one impresario. For\nalmost half a century he handled artists\u2014such world-famous artists\nas Chaliapin, Isadora Duncan, and Pavlova. Mr. Hurok told me that\none of the first lessons he had learned in dealing with his\ntemperamental stars was the necessity for sympathy, sympathy and\nmore sympathy with their idiosyncrasies.\nFor three years, he was impresario for Feodor Chaliapin\u2014one of\nthe greatest bassos who ever thrilled the ritzy boxholders at the\nMetropolitan. Yet Chaliapin was a constant problem. He carried on\nlike a spoiled child. To put it in Mr. Hurok\u2019s own inimitable phrase:\n\u201cHe was a hell of a fellow in every way.\u201d\nFor example, Chaliapin would call up Mr. Hurok about noon of the\nday he was going to sing and say, \u201cSol, I feel terrible. My throat is\nlike raw hamburger. It is impossible for me to sing tonight.\u201d Did Mr.\nHurok argue with him? Oh, no. He knew that an entrepreneur\ncouldn\u2019t handle artists that way. So he would rush over to Chaliapin\u2019s\nhotel, dripping with sympathy. \u201cWhat a pity,\u201d he would mourn. \u201cWhat\na pity! My poor fellow. Of course, you cannot sing. I will cancel the\nengagement at once. It will only cost you a couple of thousand\ndollars, but that is nothing in comparison to your reputation.\u201d\nThen Chaliapin would sigh and say, \u201cPerhaps you had better come\nover later in the day. Come at five and see how I feel then.\u201d\nAt five o\u2019clock, Mr. Hurok would again rush to his hotel, dripping\nwith sympathy. Again he would insist on canceling the engagement\nand again Chaliapin would sigh and say, \u201cWell, maybe you had\nbetter come to see me later. I may be better then.\u201d\nAt seven-thirty the great basso would consent to sing, only with the\nunderstanding that Mr. Hurok would walk out on the stage of the\nMetropolitan and announce that Chaliapin had a very bad cold and\nwas not in good voice. Mr. Hurok would lie and say he would do it,\nfor he knew that was the only way to get the basso out on the stage.\nDr. Arthur I. Gates said in his splendid book Educational\nPsychology: \u201cSympathy the human species universally craves. The\nchild eagerly displays his injury; or even inflicts a cut or bruise in\norder to reap abundant sympathy. For the same purpose adults . . .\nshow their bruises, relate their accidents, illness, especially details of\nsurgical operations. \u2018Self-pity\u2019 for misfortunes real or imaginary is, in\nsome measure, practically a universal practice.\u201d\nSo, if you want to win people to your way of thinking, put in practice\n. . .\nPRINCIPLE 9\nBe sympathetic with the other person\u2019s ideas\nand desires.\n10\nAn Appeal That Everybody Likes\nI was reared on the edge of the Jesse James country out in Missouri,\nand I visited the James farm at Kearney, Missouri, where the son of\nJesse James was then living.\nHis wife told me stories of how Jesse robbed trains and held up\nbanks and then gave money to the neighboring farmers to pay off\ntheir mortgages.\nJesse James probably regarded himself as an idealist at heart, just\nas Dutch Schultz, \u201cTwo Gun\u201d Crowley, Al Capone and many other\norganized crime \u201cgodfathers\u201d did generations later. The fact is that all\npeople you meet have a high regard for themselves and like to be\nfine and unselfish in their own estimation.\nJ. Pierpont Morgan observed, in one of his analytical interludes,\nthat a person usually has two reasons for doing a thing: one that\nsounds good and a real one.\nThe person himself will think of the real reason. You don\u2019t need to\nemphasize that. But all of us, being idealists at heart, like to think of\nmotives that sound good. So, in order to change people, appeal to\nthe nobler motives.\nIs that too idealistic to work in business? Let\u2019s see. Let\u2019s take the\ncase of Hamilton J. Farrell of the Farrell-Mitchell Company of\nGlenolden, Pennsylvania. Mr. Farrell had a disgruntled tenant who\nthreatened to move. The tenant\u2019s lease still had four months to run;\nnevertheless, he served notice that he was vacating immediately,\nregardless of lease.\n\u201cThese people had lived in my house all winter\u2014the most\nexpensive part of the year,\u201d Mr. Farrell said as he told the story to the\nclass, \u201cand I knew it would be difficult to rent the apartment again\nbefore fall. I could see all that rent income going over the hill and\nbelieve me, I saw red.\n\u201cNow, ordinarily, I would have waded into that tenant and advised\nhim to read his lease again. I would have pointed out that if he\nmoved, the full balance of his rent would fall due at once\u2014and that I\ncould, and would, move to collect.\n\u201cHowever, instead of flying off the handle and making a scene, I\ndecided to try other tactics. So I started like this: \u2018Mr. Doe,\u2019 I said, \u201cI\nhave listened to your story, and I still don\u2019t believe you intend to\nmove. Years in the renting business have taught me something\nabout human nature, and I sized you up in the first place as being a\nman of your word. In fact, I\u2019m so sure of it that I\u2019m willing to take a\ngamble.\n\u201c\u2018Now, here\u2019s my proposition. Lay your decision on the table for a\nfew days and think it over. If you come back to me between now and\nthe first of the month, when your rent is due, and tell me you still\nintend to move, I give you my word I will accept your decision as\nfinal. I will privilege you to move and admit to myself I\u2019ve been wrong\nin my judgment. But I still believe you\u2019re a man of your word and will\nlive up to your contract. For after all, we are either men or monkeys\n\u2014and the choice usually lies with ourselves!\u2019\n\u201cWell, when the new month came around, this gentleman came to\nsee me and paid his rent in person. He and his wife had talked it\nover, he said\u2014and decided to stay. They had concluded that the\nonly honorable thing to do was to live up to their lease.\u201d\nWhen the late Lord Northcliffe found a newspaper using a picture\nof him which he didn\u2019t want published, he wrote the editor a letter.\nBut did he say, \u201cPlease do not publish that picture of me any more; I\ndon\u2019t like it\u201d? No, he appealed to a nobler motive. He appealed to the\nrespect and love that all of us have for motherhood. He wrote,\n\u201cPlease do not publish that picture of me any more. My mother\ndoesn\u2019t like it.\u201d\nWhen John D. Rockefeller, Jr., wished to stop newspaper\nphotographers from snapping pictures of his children, he too\nappealed to the nobler motives. He didn\u2019t say: \u201cI don\u2019t want their\npictures published.\u201d No, he appealed to the desire, deep in all of us,\nto refrain from harming children. He said: \u201cYou know how it is, boys.\nYou\u2019ve got children yourselves, some of you. And you know it\u2019s not\ngood for youngsters to get too much publicity.\u201d\nWhen Cyrus H. K. Curtis, the poor boy from Maine, was starting on\nhis meteoric career, which was destined to make him millions as\nowner of The Saturday Evening Post and the Ladies\u2019 Home Journal,\nhe couldn\u2019t afford to pay his contributors the prices that other\nmagazines paid. He couldn\u2019t afford to hire first-class authors to write\nfor money alone. So he appealed to their nobler motives. For\nexample, he persuaded even Louisa May Alcott, the immortal author\nof Little Women, to write for him when she was at the flood tide of\nher fame; and he did it by offering to send a check for a hundred\ndollars, not to her, but to her favorite charity.\nRight here the skeptic may say: \u201cOh, that stuff is all right for\nNorthcliffe and Rockefeller or a sentimental novelist. But, I\u2019d like to\nsee you make it work with the tough babies I have to collect bills\nfrom!\u201d\nYou may be right. Nothing will work in all cases\u2014and nothing will\nwork with all people. If you are satisfied with the results you are now\ngetting, why change? If you are not satisfied, why not experiment?\nAt any rate, I think you will enjoy reading this true story told by\nJames L. Thomas, a former student of mine:\nSix customers of a certain automobile company refused to pay\ntheir bills for servicing. None of the customers protested the entire\nbill, but each claimed that some one charge was wrong. In each\ncase, the customer had signed for the work done, so the company\nknew it was right\u2014and said so. That was the first mistake.\nHere are the steps the men in the credit department took to collect\nthese overdue bills. Do you suppose they succeeded?")),(0,o.kt)("ol",null,(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"They called on each customer and told him bluntly that they had\ncome to collect a bill that was long past due."),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"They made it very plain that the company was absolutely and\nunconditionally right; therefore he, the customer, was absolutely\nand unconditionally wrong."),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"They intimated that they, the company, knew more about\nautomobiles than he could ever hope to know. So what was the\nargument about?"),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Result: They argued.\nDid any of these methods reconcile the customer and settle the\naccount? You can answer that one yourself.\nAt this stage of affairs, the credit manager was about to open fire\nwith a battery of legal talent, when fortunately the matter came to the\nattention of the general manager. The manager investigated these\ndefaulting clients and discovered that they all had the reputation of\npaying their bills promptly. Something was wrong here\u2014something\nwas drastically wrong about the method of collection. So he called in\nJames L. Thomas and told him to collect these \u201cuncollectible\u201d\naccounts.\nHere, in his words, are the steps Mr. Thomas took:"),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"My visit to each customer was likewise to collect a bill long past\ndue\u2014a bill that we knew was absolutely right. But I didn\u2019t say a\nword about that. I explained I had called to find out what it was\nthe company had done, or failed to do."),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"I made it clear that, until I had heard the customer\u2019s story, I had\nno opinion to offer. I told him the company made no claims to\nbeing infallible."),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"I told him I was interested only in his car, and that he knew more\nabout his car than anyone else in the world; that he was the\nauthority on the subject."),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"I let him talk, and I listened to him with all the interest and\nsympathy that he wanted\u2014and had expected."),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Finally, when the customer was in a reasonable mood, I put the\nwhole thing up to his sense of fair play. I appealed to the nobler\nmotives. \u201cFirst,\u201d I said, \u201cI want you to know I also feel this matter\nhas been badly mishandled. You\u2019ve been inconvenienced and\nannoyed and irritated by one of our representatives. That should\nnever have happened. I\u2019m sorry and, as a representative of the\ncompany, I apologize. As I sat here and listened to your side of\nthe story, I could not help being impressed by your fairness and\npatience. And now, because you are fair-minded and patient, I\nam going to ask you to do something for me. It\u2019s something that\nyou can do better than anyone else, something you know more\nabout than anyone else. Here is your bill; I know it is safe for me\nto ask you to adjust it, just as you would do if you were the\npresident of my company. I am going to leave it all up to you.\nWhatever you say goes.\u201d\nDid he adjust the bill? He certainly did, and got quite a kick out\nof it. The bills ranged from $150 to $400\u2014but did the customer\ngive himself the best of it? Yes, one of them did! One of them\nrefused to pay a penny of the disputed charge; but the other five\nall gave the company the best of it! And here\u2019s the cream of the\nwhole thing: we delivered new cars to all six of these customers\nwithin the next two years!\n\u201cExperience has taught me,\u201d says Mr. Thomas, \u201cthat when no\ninformation can be secured about the customer, the only sound basis\non which to proceed is to assume that he or she is sincere, honest,\ntruthful and willing and anxious to pay the charges, once convinced\nthey are correct. To put it differently and perhaps more clearly,\npeople are honest and want to discharge their obligations. The\nexceptions to that rule are comparatively few, and I am convinced\nthat the individuals who are inclined to chisel will in most cases react\nfavorably if you make them feel that you consider them honest,\nupright and fair.\u201d\nPRINCIPLE 10\nAppeal to the nobler motives.\n11\nThe Movies Do It. TV Does It. Why Don\u2019t You Do\nIt?\nMany years ago, the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin was being\nmaligned by a dangerous whispering campaign. A malicious rumor\nwas being circulated. Advertisers were being told that the newspaper\nwas no longer attractive to readers because it carried too much\nadvertising and too little news. Immediate action was necessary. The\ngossip had to be squelched.\nBut how?\nThis is the way it was done.\nThe Bulletin clipped from its regular edition all reading matter of all\nkinds on one average day, classified it, and published it as a book.\nThe book was called One Day. It contained 307 pages\u2014as many as\na hardcover book; yet the Bulletin had printed all this news and\nfeature material on one day and sold it, not for several dollars, but for\na few cents.\nThe printing of that book dramatized the fact that the Bulletin\ncarried an enormous amount of interesting reading matter. It\nconveyed the facts more vividly, more interestingly, more\nimpressively, than pages of figures and mere talk could have done.\nThis is the day of dramatization. Merely stating a truth isn\u2019t enough.\nThe truth has to be made vivid, interesting, dramatic. You have to\nuse showmanship. The movies do it. Television does it. And you will\nhave to do it if you want attention.\nExperts in window display know the power of dramatization. For\nexample, the manufacturers of a new rat poison gave dealers a\nwindow display that included two live rats. The week the rats were\nshown, sales zoomed to five times their normal rate.\nTelevision commercials abound with examples of the use of\ndramatic techniques in selling products. Sit down one evening in\nfront of your television set and analyze what the advertisers do in\neach of their presentations. You will note how an antacid medicine\nchanges the color of the acid in a test tube while its competitor\ndoesn\u2019t, how one brand of soap or detergent gets a greasy shirt\nclean while the other brand leaves it gray. You\u2019ll see a car maneuver\naround a series of turns and curves\u2014far better than just being told\nabout it. Happy faces will show contentment with a variety of\nproducts. All of these dramatize for the viewer the advantages\noffered by whatever is being sold\u2014and they do get people to buy\nthem.\nYou can dramatize your ideas in business or in any other aspect of\nyour life. It\u2019s easy. Jim Yeamans, who sells for the NCR company\n(National Cash Register) in Richmond, Virginia, told how he made a\nsale by dramatic demonstration.\n\u201cLast week I called on a neighborhood grocer and saw that the\ncash registers he was using at his check-out counters were very old\x02fashioned. I approached the owner and told him: \u2018You are literally\nthrowing away pennies every time a customer goes through your\nline.\u2019 With that I threw a handful of pennies on the floor. He quickly\nbecame more attentive. The mere words should have been of\ninterest to him, but the sound of pennies hitting the floor really\nstopped him. I was able to get an order from him to replace all of his\nold machines.\u201d\nIt works in home life as well. When the old-time lover proposed to\nhis sweetheart, did he just use words of love? No! He went down on\nhis knees. That really showed he meant what he said. We don\u2019t\npropose on our knees any more, but many suitors still set up a\nromantic atmosphere before they pop the question.\nDramatizing what you want works with children as well. Joe B.\nFant, Jr., of Birmingham, Alabama, was having difficulty getting his\nfive-year-old boy and three-year-old daughter to pick up their toys,\nso he invented a \u201ctrain.\u201d Joey was the engineer (Captain Casey\nJones) on his tricycle. Janet\u2019s wagon was attached, and in the\nevening she loaded all the \u201ccoal\u201d on the caboose (her wagon) and\nthen jumped in while her brother drove her around the room. In this\nway the room was cleaned up\u2014without lectures, arguments or\nthreats.\nMary Catherine Wolf of Mishawaka, Indiana, was having some\nproblems at work and decided that she had to discuss them with the\nboss. On Monday morning she requested an appointment with him\nbut was told he was very busy and she should arrange with his\nsecretary for an appointment later in the week. The secretary\nindicated that his schedule was very tight, but she would try to fit her\nin.\nMs. Wolf described what happened:\n\u201cI did not get a reply from her all week long. Whenever I questioned\nher, she would give me a reason why the boss could not see me.\nFriday morning came and I had heard nothing definite. I really\nwanted to see him and discuss my problems before the weekend, so\nI asked myself how I could get him to see me.\n\u201cWhat I finally did was this. I wrote him a formal letter. I indicated in\nthe letter that I fully understood how extremely busy he was all week,\nbut it was important that I speak with him. I enclosed a form letter\nand a self-addressed envelope and asked him to please fill it out or\nask his secretary to do it and return it to me. The form letter read as\nfollows:\nMs. Wolf\u2014I will be able to see you on ",(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"li"},"_")," at ",(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"li"},"_"),"\na.m./p.m. I will give you ",(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"li"},"_")," minutes of my time.\n\u201cI put this letter in his in-basket at 11 A.M. At 2 P.M. I checked my\nmailbox. There was my self-addressed envelope. He had answered\nmy form letter himself and indicated he could see me that afternoon\nand could give me ten minutes of his time. I met with him, and we\ntalked for over an hour and resolved my problems.\n\u201cIf I had not dramatized to him the fact that I really wanted to see\nhim, I would probably be still waiting for an appointment.\u201d\nJames B. Boynton had to present a lengthy market report. His firm\nhad just finished an exhaustive study for a leading brand of cold\ncream. Data were needed immediately about the competition in this\nmarket; the prospective customer was one of the biggest\u2014and most\nformidable\u2014men in the advertising business.\nAnd his first approach failed almost before he began.\n\u201cThe first time I went in,\u201d Mr. Boynton explains, \u201cI found myself\nsidetracked into a futile discussion of the methods used in the\ninvestigation. He argued and I argued. He told me I was wrong, and I\ntried to prove that I was right.\n\u201cI finally won my point, to my own satisfaction\u2014but my time was\nup, the interview was over, and I still hadn\u2019t produced results.\n\u201cThe second time, I didn\u2019t bother with tabulations of figures and\ndata. I went to see this man, I dramatized my facts.\n\u201cAs I entered his office, he was busy on the phone. While he\nfinished his conversation, I opened a suitcase and dumped thirty-two\njars of cold cream on top of his desk\u2014all products he knew\u2014all\ncompetitors of his cream.\n\u201cOn each jar, I had a tag itemizing the results of the trade\ninvestigation. And each tag told its story briefly, dramatically.\n\u201cWhat happened?\n\u201cThere was no longer an argument. Here was something new,\nsomething different. He picked up first one and then another of the\njars of cold cream and read the information on the tag. A friendly\nconversation developed. He asked additional questions. He was\nintensely interested. He had originally given me only ten minutes to\npresent my facts, but ten minutes passed, twenty minutes, forty\nminutes, and at the end of an hour we were still talking.\n\u201cI was presenting the same facts this time that I had presented\npreviously. But this time I was using dramatization, showmanship\u2014\nand what a difference it made.\u201d\nPRINCIPLE 11\nDramatize your ideas.\n12\nWhen Nothing Else Works, Try This\nCharles Schwab had a mill manager whose people weren\u2019t\nproducing their quota of work.\n\u201cHow is it,\u201d Schwab asked him, \u201cthat a manager as capable as you\ncan\u2019t make this mill turn out what it should?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d the manager replied. \u201cI\u2019ve coaxed the men, I\u2019ve\npushed them, I\u2019ve sworn and cussed, I\u2019ve threatened them with\ndamnation and being fired. But nothing works. They just won\u2019t\nproduce.\u201d\nThis conversation took place at the end of the day, just before the\nnight shift came on. Schwab asked the manager for a piece of chalk,\nthen, turning to the nearest man, asked: \u201cHow many heats did your\nshift make today?\u201d\n\u201cSix.\u201d\nWithout another word, Schwab chalked a big figure six on the floor,\nand walked away.\nWhen the night shift came in, they saw the \u201c6\u201d and asked what it\nmeant.\n\u201cThe big boss was in here today,\u201d the day people said. \u201cHe asked\nus how many heats we made, and we told him six. He chalked it\ndown on the floor.\u201d\nThe next morning Schwab walked through the mill again. The night\nshift had rubbed out \u201c6\u201d and replaced it with a big \u201c7.\u201d\nWhen the day shift reported for work the next morning, they saw a\nbig \u201c7\u201d chalked on the floor. So the night shift thought they were\nbetter than the day shift, did they? Well, they would show the night\nshift a thing or two. The crew pitched in with enthusiasm, and when\nthey quit that night, they left behind them an enormous, swaggering\n\u201c10.\u201d Things were stepping up.\nShortly this mill, which had been lagging way behind in production,\nwas turning out more work than any other mill in the plant.\nThe principle?\nLet Charles Schwab say it in his own words: \u201cThe way to get things\ndone,\u201d says Schwab, \u201cis to stimulate competition. I do not mean in a\nsordid, money-getting way, but in the desire to excel.\u201d\nThe desire to excel! The challenge! Throwing down the gauntlet!\nAn infallible way of appealing to people of spirit.\nWithout a challenge, Theodore Roosevelt would never have been\nPresident of the United States. The Rough Rider, just back from\nCuba, was picked for governor of New York State. The opposition\ndiscovered he was no longer a legal resident of the state, and\nRoosevelt, frightened, wished to withdraw. Then Thomas Collier\nPlatt, then U.S. Senator from New York, threw down the challenge.\nTurning suddenly on Theodore Roosevelt, he cried in a ringing voice:\n\u201cIs the hero of San Juan Hill a coward?\u201d\nRoosevelt stayed in the fight\u2014and the rest is history. A challenge\nnot only changed his life; it had a real effect upon the future of his\nnation.\n\u201cAll men have fears, but the brave put down their fears and go\nforward, sometimes to death, but always to victory\u201d was the motto of\nthe King\u2019s Guard in ancient Greece. What greater challenge can be\noffered than the opportunity to overcome those fears?\nWhen Al Smith was governor of New York, he was up against it.\nSing Sing, at the time the most notorious penitentiary west of Devil\u2019s\nIsland, was without a warden. Scandals had been sweeping through\nthe prison walls, scandals and ugly rumors. Smith needed a strong\nman to rule Sing Sing\u2014an iron man. But who? He sent for Lewis E.\nLawes of New Hampton.\n\u201cHow about going up to take charge of Sing Sing?\u201d he said jovially\nwhen Lawes stood before him. \u201cThey need a man up there with\nexperience.\u201d\nLawes was flabbergasted. He knew the dangers of Sing Sing. It\nwas a political appointment, subject to the vagaries of political\nwhims. Wardens had come and gone\u2014one had lasted only three\nweeks. He had a career to consider. Was it worth the risk?\nThen Smith, who saw his hesitation, leaned back in his chair and\nsmiled. \u201cYoung fellow,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t blame you for being scared.\nIt\u2019s a tough spot. It\u2019ll take a big person to go up there and stay.\u201d\nSo Smith was throwing down a challenge, was he? Lawes liked the\nidea of attempting a job that called for someone \u201cbig.\u201d\nSo he went. And he stayed. He stayed, to become the most\nfamous warden of his time. His book 20,000 Years in Sing Sing sold\ninto the hundreds of thousands of copies. His broadcasts on the air\nand his stories of prison life have inspired dozens of movies. His\n\u201chumanizing\u201d of criminals wrought miracles in the way of prison\nreform.\n\u201cI have never found,\u201d said Harvey S. Firestone, founder of the great\nFirestone Tire and Rubber Company, \u201cthat pay and pay alone would\neither bring together or hold good people. I think it was the game\nitself.\u201d\nFrederic Herzberg, one of the great behavorial scientists,\nconcurred. He studied in depth the work attitudes of thousands of\npeople ranging from factory workers to senior executives.

Drifting into the\nPresident\u2019s private office, he heard Coolidge say to one of his\nsecretaries, \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty dress you are wearing this morning, and\nyou are a very attractive young woman.\u201d\nThat was probably the most effusive praise Silent Cal had ever\nbestowed upon a secretary in his life. It was so unusual, so\nunexpected, that the secretary blushed in confusion. Then Coolidge\nsaid, \u201cNow, don\u2019t get stuck up. I just said that to make you feel good.\nFrom now on, I wish you would be a little bit more careful with your\npunctuation.\u201d\nHis method was probably a bit obvious, but the psychology was\nsuperb. It is always easier to listen to unpleasant things after we\nhave heard some praise of our good points.\nA barber lathers a man before he shaves him; and that is precisely\nwhat McKinley did back in 1896, when he was running for President.\nOne of the prominent Republicans of that day had written a\ncampaign speech that he felt was just a trifle better than Cicero and\nPatrick Henry and Daniel Webster all rolled into one. With great glee,\nthis chap read his immortal speech aloud to McKinley. The speech\nhad its fine points, but it just wouldn\u2019t do. It would have raised a\ntornado of criticism. McKinley didn\u2019t want to hurt the man\u2019s feelings.\nHe must not kill the man\u2019s splendid enthusiasm, and yet he had to\nsay \u201cno.\u201d Note how adroitly he did it.\n\u201cMy friend, that is a splendid speech, a magnificent speech,\u201d\nMcKinley said. \u201cNo one could have prepared a better one. There are\nmany occasions on which it would be precisely the right thing to say,\nbut is it quite suitable to this particular occasion? Sound and sober\nas it is from your standpoint, I must consider its effect from the\nparty\u2019s standpoint. Now you go home and write a speech along the\nlines I indicate, and send me a copy of it.\u201d\nHe did just that. McKinley blue-penciled and helped him rewrite his\nsecond speech, and he became one of the effective speakers of the\ncampaign.\nHere is the second most famous letter that Abraham Lincoln ever\nwrote. (His most famous one was written to Mrs. Bixby, expressing\nhis sorrow for the death of the five sons she had lost in battle.)\nLincoln probably dashed this letter off in five minutes; yet it sold at\npublic auction in 1926 for twelve thousand dollars, and that, by the\nway, was more money than Lincoln was able to save during half a\ncentury of hard work. The letter was written to General Joseph\nHooker on April 26, 1863, during the darkest period of the Civil War.\nFor eighteen months, Lincoln\u2019s generals had been leading the Union\nArmy from one tragic defeat to another. Nothing but futile, stupid\nhuman butchery. The nation was appalled. Thousands of soldiers\nhad deserted from the army, and even the Republican members of\nthe Senate had revolted and wanted to force Lincoln out of the White\nHouse. \u201cWe are now on the brink of destruction,\u201d Lincoln said. \u201cIt\nappears to me that even the Almighty is against us. I can hardly see\na ray of hope.\u201d Such was the period of black sorrow and chaos out of\nwhich this letter came.\nI am printing the letter here because it shows how Lincoln tried to\nchange an obstreperous general when the very fate of the nation\ncould have depended upon the general\u2019s action.\nThis is perhaps the sharpest letter Abe Lincoln wrote after he\nbecame President; yet you will note that he praised General Hooker\nbefore he spoke of his grave faults.\nYes, they were grave faults, but Lincoln didn\u2019t call them that.\nLincoln was more conservative, more diplomatic. Lincoln wrote:\n\u201cThere are some things in regard to which I am not quite satisfied\nwith you.\u201d Talk about tact! And diplomacy!\nHere is the letter addressed to General Hooker:\nI have placed you at the head of the Army of the Potomac. Of\ncourse, I have done this upon what appears to me to be\nsufficient reasons, and yet I think it best for you to know that\nthere are some things in regard to which I am not quite satisfied\nwith you.\nI believe you to be a brave and skillful soldier, which, of course,\nI like. I also believe you do not mix politics with your profession,\nin which you are right. You have confidence in yourself, which is\na valuable if not an indispensable quality.\nYou are ambitious, which, within reasonable bounds, does\ngood rather than harm. But I think that during General Burnside\u2019s\ncommand of the army you have taken counsel of your ambition\nand thwarted him as much as you could, in which you did a great\nwrong to the country and to a most meritorious and honorable\nbrother officer.\nI have heard, in such a way as to believe it, of your recently\nsaying that both the army and the Government needed a\ndictator. Of course, it was not for this, but in spite of it, that I have\ngiven you command.\nOnly those generals who gain successes can set up as\ndictators. What I now ask of you is military success and I will risk\nthe dictatorship.\nThe Government will support you to the utmost of its ability,\nwhich is neither more nor less than it has done and will do for all\ncommanders. I much fear that the spirit which you have aided to\ninfuse into the army, of criticizing their commander and\nwithholding confidence from him, will now turn upon you. I shall\nassist you, as far as I can, to put it down.\nNeither you nor Napoleon, if he were alive again, could get any\ngood out of an army while such spirit prevails in it, and now\nbeware of rashness. Beware of rashness, but with energy and\nsleepless vigilance go forward and give us victories.\nYou are not a Coolidge, a McKinley or a Lincoln. You want to know\nwhether this philosophy will operate for you in everyday business\ncontacts. Will it? Let\u2019s see. Let\u2019s take the case of W.P. Gaw of the\nWark Company, Philadelphia.\nThe Wark Company had contracted to build and complete a large\noffice building in Philadelphia by a certain specified date. Everything\nwas going along well; the building was almost finished, when\nsuddenly the subcontractor making the ornamental bronze work to\ngo on the exterior of this building declared that he couldn\u2019t make\ndelivery on schedule. What! An entire building held up! Heavy\npenalties! Distressing losses! All because of one man!\nLong-distance telephone calls. Arguments! Heated conversations!\nAll in vain. Then Mr. Gaw was sent to New York to beard the bronze\nlion in his den.\n\u201cDo you know you are the only person in Brooklyn with your\nname?\u201d Mr. Gaw asked the president of the subcontracting firm\nshortly after they were introduced. The president was surprised. \u201cNo,\nI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Mr. Gaw, \u201cwhen I got off the train this morning, I looked\nin the telephone book to get your address, and you\u2019re the only\nperson in the Brooklyn phone book with your name.\u201d\n\u201cI never knew that,\u201d the subcontractor said. He checked the phone\nbook with interest. \u201cWell, it\u2019s an unusual name,\u201d he said proudly. \u201cMy\nfamily came from Holland and settled in New York almost two\nhundred years ago.\u201d He continued to talk about his family and his\nancestors for several minutes. When he finished that, Mr. Gaw\ncomplimented him on how large a plant he had and compared it\nfavorably with a number of similar plants he had visited. \u201cIt is one of\nthe cleanest and neatest bronze factories I ever saw,\u201d said Gaw.\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent a lifetime building up this business,\u201d the subcontractor\nsaid, \u201cand I am rather proud of it. Would you like to take a look\naround the factory?\u201d\nDuring this tour of inspection, Mr. Gaw complimented the other\nman on his system of fabrication and told him how and why it\nseemed superior to those of some of his competitors. Gaw\ncommented on some unusual machines and the subcontractor\nannounced that he himself had invented those machines. He spent\nconsiderable time showing Gaw how they operated and the superior\nwork they turned out. He insisted on taking his visitor to lunch. So\nfar, mind you, not a word had been said about the real purpose of\nGaw\u2019s visit.\nAfter lunch, the subcontractor said, \u201cNow, to get down to business.\nNaturally, I know why you\u2019re here. I didn\u2019t expect that our meeting\nwould be so enjoyable. You can go back to Philadelphia with my\npromise that your material will be fabricated and shipped, even if\nother orders have to be delayed.\u201d\nMr. Gaw got everything that he wanted without even asking for it.\nThe material arrived on time, and the building was completed on the\nday the completion contract specified.\nWould this have happened had Mr. Gaw used the hammer-and\x02dynamite method generally employed on such occasions?\nDorothy Wrublewski, a branch manager of the Fort Monmouth,\nNew Jersey, Federal Credit Union, reported to one of our classes\nhow she was able to help one of her employees become more\nproductive.\n\u201cWe recently hired a young lady as a teller trainee. Her contact with\nour customers was very good. She was accurate and efficient in\nhandling individual transactions. The problem developed at the end\nof the day when it was time to balance out.\n\u201cThe head teller came to me and strongly suggested that I fire this\nwoman. \u2018She is holding up everyone else because she is so slow in\nbalancing out. I\u2019ve shown her over and over, but she can\u2019t get it.\nShe\u2019s got to go.\u2019\n\u201cThe next day I observed her working quickly and accurately when\nhandling the normal everyday transactions, and she was very\npleasant with our customers.\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t take long to discover why she had trouble balancing out.\nAfter the office closed, I went over to talk with her. She was\nobviously nervous and upset. I praised her for being so friendly and\noutgoing with the customers and complimented her for the accuracy\nand speed used in that work. I then suggested we review the\nprocedure we used in balancing the cash drawer. Once she realized\nI had confidence in her, she easily followed my suggestions and\nsoon mastered this function. We have had no problems with her\nsince then.\u201d\nBeginning with praise is like the dentist who begins his work with\nNovocain. The patient still gets a drilling, but the Novocain is pain\x02killing. A leader will use . . .\nPRINCIPLE 1\nBegin with praise and honest appreciation.\n2\nHow to Criticize\u2014and Not Be Hated for It\nCharles Schwab was passing though one of his steel mills one day\nat noon when he came across some of his employees smoking.\nImmediately above their heads was a sign that said \u201cNo Smoking.\u201d\nDid Schwab point to the sign and say, \u201cCan\u2019t you read?\u201d Oh, no not\nSchwab. He walked over to the men, handed each one a cigar, and\nsaid, \u201cI\u2019ll appreciate it, boys, if you will smoke these on the outside.\u201d\nThey knew that he knew that they had broken a rule\u2014and they\nadmired him because he said nothing about it and gave them a little\npresent and made them feel important. Couldn\u2019t keep from loving a\nman like that, could you?\nJohn Wanamaker used the same technique. Wanamaker used to\nmake a tour of his great store in Philadelphia every day. Once he\nsaw a customer waiting at a counter. No one was paying the\nslightest attention to her. The salespeople? Oh, they were in a\nhuddle at the far end of the counter laughing and talking among\nthemselves. Wanamaker didn\u2019t say a word. Quietly slipping behind\nthe counter, he waited on the woman himself and then handed the\npurchase to the salespeople to be wrapped as he went on his way.\nPublic officials are often criticized for not being accessible to their\nconstituents. They are busy people, and the fault sometimes lies in\noverprotective assistants who don\u2019t want to overburden their bosses\nwith too many visitors. Carl Langford, who has been mayor of\nOrlando, Florida, the home of Disney World, for many years,\nfrequently admonished his staff to allow people to see him. He\nclaimed he had an \u201copen-door\u201d policy; yet the citizens of his\ncommunity were blocked by secretaries and administrators when\nthey called.\nFinally the mayor found the solution. He removed the door from his\noffice! His aides got the message, and the mayor has had a truly\nopen administration since the day his door was symbolically thrown\naway.\nSimply changing one three-letter word can often spell the\ndifference between failure and success in changing people without\ngiving offense or arousing resentment.\nMany people begin their criticism with sincere praise followed by\nthe word \u201cbut\u201d and ending with a critical statement. For example, in\ntrying to change a child\u2019s careless attitude toward studies, we might\nsay, \u201cWe\u2019re really proud of you, Johnnie, for raising your grades this\nterm. But if you had worked harder on your algebra, the results\nwould have been better.\u201d\nIn this case, Johnnie might feel encouraged until he heard the word\n\u201cbut.\u201d He might then question the sincerity of the original praise. To\nhim, the praise seemed only to be a contrived lead-in to a critical\ninference of failure. Credibility would be strained, and we probably\nwould not achieve our objectives of changing Johnnie\u2019s attitude\ntoward his studies.\nThis could be easily overcome by changing the word \u201cbut\u201d to \u201cand.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re really proud of you, Johnnie, for raising your grades this term,\nand by continuing the same conscientious efforts next term, your\nalgebra grade can be up with all the others.\u201d\nNow, Johnnie would accept the praise because there was no\nfollow-up of an inference of failure. We have called his attention to\nthe behavior we wished to change indirectly, and the chances are he\nwill try to live up to our expectations.\nCalling attention to one\u2019s mistakes indirectly works wonders with\nsensitive people who may resent bitterly any direct criticism. Marge\nJacob of Woonsocket, Rhode Island, told one of our classes how\nshe convinced some sloppy construction workers to clean up after\nthemselves when they were building additions to her house.\nFor the first few days of the work, when Mrs. Jacob returned from\nher job, she noticed that the yard was strewn with the cut ends of\nlumber. She didn\u2019t want to antagonize the builders, because they did\nexcellent work. So after the workers had gone home, she and her\nchildren picked up and neatly piled all the lumber debris in a corner.\nThe following morning she called the foreman to one side and said,\n\u201cI\u2019m really pleased with the way the front lawn was left last night; it is\nnice and clean and does not offend the neighbors.\u201d From that day\nforward the workers picked up and piled the debris to one side, and\nthe foreman came in each day seeking approval of the condition the\nlawn was left in after a day\u2019s work.\nOne of the major areas of controversy between members of the\narmy reserves and their regular army trainers is haircuts. The\nreservists consider themselves civilians (which they are most of the\ntime) and resent having to cut their hair short.\nMaster Sergeant Harley Kaiser of the 542nd USAR School\naddressed himself to this problem when he was working with a group\nof reserve noncommissioned officers. As an old-time regular-army\nmaster sergeant, he might have been expected to yell at his troops\nand threaten them. Instead he chose to make his point indirectly.\n\u201cGentlemen,\u201d he started, \u201cyou are leaders. You will be most\neffective when you lead by example. You must be the example for\nyour men to follow. You know what the army regulations say about\nhaircuts. I am going to get my hair cut today, although it is still much\nshorter than some of yours. You look at yourself in the mirror, and if\nyou feel you need a haircut to be a good example, we\u2019ll arrange time\nfor you to visit the post barbershop.\u201d\nThe result was predictable. Several of the candidates did look in\nthe mirror and went to the barbershop that afternoon and received\n\u201cregulation\u201d haircuts. Sergeant Kaiser commented the next morning\nthat he already could see the development of leadership qualities in\nsome of the members of the squad.\nOn March 8, 1887, the eloquent Henry Ward Beecher died. The\nfollowing Sunday, Lyman Abbott was invited to speak in the pulpit left\nsilent by Beecher\u2019s passing. Eager to do his best, he wrote, rewrote\nand polished his sermon with the meticulous care of a Flaubert.\nThen he read it to his wife. It was poor\u2014as most written speeches\nare. She might have said, if she had had less judgment, \u201cLyman, that\nis terrible. That\u2019ll never do. You\u2019ll put people to sleep. It reads like an\nencyclopedia. You ought to know better than that after all the years\nyou have been preaching. For heaven\u2019s sake, why don\u2019t you talk like\na human being? Why don\u2019t you act natural? You\u2019ll disgrace yourself\nif you ever read that stuff.\u201d\nThat\u2019s what she might have said. And, if she had, you know what\nwould have happened. And she knew too. So, she merely remarked\nthat it would make an excellent article for the North American\nReview. In other words, she praised it and at the same time subtly\nsuggested that it wouldn\u2019t do as a speech. Lyman Abbott saw the\npoint, tore up his carefully prepared manuscript and preached\nwithout even using notes.\nAn effective way to correct others\u2019 mistakes is . . .\nPRINCIPLE 2\nCall attention to people\u2019s mistakes indirectly.\n3\nTalk About Your Own Mistakes First\nMy niece, Josephine Carnegie, had come to New York to be my\nsecretary. She was nineteen, had graduated from high school three\nyears previously, and her business experience was a trifle more than\nzero. She became one of the most proficient secretaries west of\nSuez, but in the beginning, she was\u2014well, susceptible to\nimprovement. One day when I started to criticize her, I said to\nmyself: \u201cJust a minute, Dale Carnegie; just a minute. You are twice\nas old as Josephine. You have had ten thousand times as much\nbusiness experience. How can you possibly expect her to have your\nviewpoint, your judgment, your initiative\u2014mediocre though they may\nbe? And just a minute, Dale, what were you doing at nineteen?\nRemember the asinine mistakes and blunders you made?\nRemember the time you did this . . . and that . . . ?\u201d\nAfter thinking the matter over, honestly and impartially, I concluded\nthat Josephine\u2019s batting average at nineteen was better than mine\nhad been\u2014and that, I\u2019m sorry to confess, isn\u2019t paying Josephine\nmuch of a compliment.\nSo after that, when I wanted to call Josephine\u2019s attention to a\nmistake, I used to begin by saying, \u201cYou have made a mistake,\nJosephine, but the Lord knows, it\u2019s no worse than many I have\nmade. You were not born with judgment. That comes only with\nexperience, and you are better than I was at your age. I have been\nguilty of so many stupid, silly things myself, I have very little\ninclination to criticize you or anyone. But don\u2019t you think it would\nhave been wiser if you had done so and so?\u201d\nIt isn\u2019t nearly so difficult to listen to a recital of your faults if the\nperson criticizing begins by humbly admitting that he, too, is far from\nimpeccable.\nE. G. Dillistone, an engineer in Brandon, Manitoba, Canada, was\nhaving problems with his new secretary. Letters he dictated were\ncoming to his desk for signature with two or three spelling mistakes\nper page. Mr. Dillistone reported how he handled this:\n\u201cLike many engineers, I have not been noted for my excellent\nEnglish or spelling. For years I have kept a little black thumb-index\nbook for words I had trouble spelling. When it became apparent that\nmerely pointing out the errors was not going to cause my secretary\nto do more proofreading and dictionary work, I resolved to take\nanother approach. When the next letter came to my attention that\nhad errors in it, I sat down with the typist and said:\n\u201c\u2018Somehow this word doesn\u2019t look right. It\u2019s one of the words I\nalways have had trouble with. That\u2019s the reason I started this spelling\nbook of mine. ","[I opened the book to the appropriate page.]"," Yes, here\nit is. I\u2019m very conscious of my spelling now because people do judge\nus by our letters and misspellings make us look less professional.\u2019\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether she copied my system or not, but since that\nconversation, her frequency of spelling errors has been significantly\nreduced.\u201d\nThe polished Prince Bernhard von B\xfclow learned the sharp\nnecessity of doing this back in 1909. Von B\xfclow was then the\nImperial Chancellor of Germany, and on the throne set Wilhelm II\u2014\nWilhelm, the haughty; Wilhelm, the arrogant; Wilhelm, the last of the\nGerman kaisers, building an army and navy that he boasted could\nwhip their weight in wildcats.\nThen an astonishing thing happened. The Kaiser said things,\nincredible things, things that rocked the continent and started a\nseries of explosions heard around the world. To make matters\ninfinitely worse, the Kaiser made silly, egotistical, absurd\nannouncements in public, he made them while he was a guest in\nEngland, and he gave his royal permission to have them printed in\nthe Daily Telegraph. For example, he declared that he was the only\nGerman who felt friendly toward the English; that he was\nconstructing a navy against the menace of Japan; that he, and he\nalone, had saved England from being humbled in the dust by Russia\nand France; that it had been his campaign plan that enabled\nEngland\u2019s Lord Roberts to defeat the Boers in South Africa; and so\non and on.\nNo other such amazing words had ever fallen from the lips of a\nEuropean king in peacetime within a hundred years. The entire\ncontinent buzzed with the fury of a hornet\u2019s nest. England was\nincensed. German statesmen were aghast. And in the midst of all\nthis consternation, the Kaiser became panicky and suggested to\nPrince von B\xfclow, the Imperial Chancellor, that he take the blame.\nYes, he wanted von B\xfclow to announce that it was all his\nresponsibility, that he had advised his monarch to say these\nincredible things.\n\u201cBut Your Majesty,\u201d von B\xfclow protested, \u201cit seems to me utterly\nimpossible that anybody either in Germany or England could\nsuppose me capable of having advised Your Majesty to say any\nsuch thing.\u201d\nThe moment those words were out of von B\xfclow\u2019s mouth, he\nrealized he had made a grave mistake. The Kaiser blew up.\n\u201cYou consider me a donkey,\u201d he shouted, \u201ccapable of blunders you\nyourself could never have committed!\u201d\nVon B\xfclow knew that he ought to have praised before he\ncondemned; but since that was too late, he did the next best thing.\nHe praised after he had criticized. And it worked a miracle.\n\u201cI\u2019m far from suggesting that,\u201d he answered respectfully. \u201cYour\nMajesty surpasses me in many respects; not only, of course, in naval\nand military knowledge but, above all, in natural science. I have often\nlistened in admiration when Your Majesty explained the barometer,\nor wireless telegraphy, or the Roentgen rays. I am shamefully\nignorant of all branches of natural science, have no notion of\nchemistry or physics, and am quite incapable of explaining the\nsimplest of natural phenomena. But,\u201d von B\xfclow continued, \u201cin\ncompensation, I possess some historical knowledge and perhaps\ncertain qualities useful in politics, especially in diplomacy.\u201d\nThe Kaiser beamed. Von B\xfclow had praised him. Von B\xfclow had\nexalted him and humbled himself. The Kaiser could forgive anything\nafter that. \u201cHaven\u2019t I always told you,\u201d he exclaimed with enthusiasm,\n\u201cthat we complete one another famously? We should stick together,\nand we will!\u201d\nHe shook hands with von B\xfclow, not once, but several times. And\nlater in the day he waxed so enthusiastic that he exclaimed with\ndoubled fists, \u201cIf anyone says anything to me against Prince von\nB\xfclow, I shall punch him in the nose.\u201d\nVon B\xfclow saved himself in time\u2014but, canny diplomat that he was,\nhe nevertheless had made one error: he should have begun by\ntalking about his own shortcomings and Wilhelm\u2019s superiority\u2014not\nby intimating that the Kaiser was a half-wit in need of a guardian.\nIf a few sentences humbling oneself and praising the other party\ncan turn a haughty, insulted Kaiser into a staunch friend, imagine\nwhat humility and praise can do for you and me in our daily contacts.\nRightfully used, they will work veritable miracles in human relations.\nAdmitting one\u2019s own mistakes\u2014even when one hasn\u2019t corrected\nthem\u2014can help convince somebody to change his behavior. This\nwas illustrated more recently by Clarence Zerhusen of Timonium,\nMaryland, when he discovered his fifteen-year-old son was\nexperimenting with cigarettes.\n\u201cNaturally, I didn\u2019t want David to smoke,\u201d Mr. Zerhusen told us, \u201cbut\nhis mother and I smoked cigarettes; we were giving him a bad\nexample all the time. I explained to Dave how I started smoking at\nabout his age and how the nicotine had gotten the best of me and\nnow it was nearly impossible for me to stop. I reminded him how\nirritating my cough was and how he had been after me to give up\ncigarettes not many years before.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t exhort him to stop or make threats or warn him about their\ndangers. All I did was point out how I was hooked on cigarettes and\nwhat it had meant to me.\n\u201cHe thought about it for a while and decided he wouldn\u2019t smoke\nuntil he had graduated from high school. As the years went by David\nnever did start smoking and has no intention of ever doing so.\n\u201cAs a result of that conversation I made the decision to stop\nsmoking cigarettes myself, and with the support of my family, I have\nsucceeded.\u201d\nA good leader follows this principle:\nPRINCIPLE 3\nTalk about your own mistakes before\ncriticizing the other person.")),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"4\nNo One Likes to Take Orders\nI once had the pleasure of dining with Miss Ida Tarbell, the dean of\nAmerican biographers. When I told her I was writing this book, we\nbegan discussing this all-important subject of getting along with\npeople, and she told me that while she was writing her biography of\nOwen D.

Young\nnever said, for example, \u201cDo this or do that,\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t do this or don\u2019t\ndo that.\u201d He would say, \u201cYou might consider this,\u201d or \u201cDo you think\nthat would work?\u201d Frequently he would say, after he had dictated a\nletter, \u201cWhat do you think of this?\u201d In looking over a letter of one of\nhis assistants, he would say, \u201cMaybe if we were to phrase it this way\nit would be better.\u201d He always gave people the opportunity to do\nthings themselves; he never told his assistants to do things; he let\nthem do them, let them learn from their mistakes.\nA technique like that makes it easy for a person to correct errors. A\ntechnique like that saves a person\u2019s pride and gives him or her a\nfeeling of importance. It encourages cooperation instead of rebellion.\nResentment caused by a brash order may last a long time\u2014even if\nthe order was given to correct an obviously bad situation. Dan\nSantarelli, a teacher at a vocational school in Wyoming,\nPennsylvania, told one of our classes how one of his students had\nblocked the entrance way to one of the school\u2019s shops by illegally\nparking his car in it. One of the other instructors stormed into the\nclassroom and asked in an arrogant tone, \u201cWhose car is blocking the\ndriveway?\u201d When the student who owned the car responded, the\ninstructor screamed: \u201cMove that car and move it right now, or I\u2019ll\nwrap a chain around it and drag it out of there.\u201d\nNow that student was wrong. The car should not have been parked\nthere. But from that day on, not only did that student resent the\ninstructor\u2019s action, but all the students in the class did everything\nthey could to give the instructor a hard time and make his job\nunpleasant.\nHow could he have handled it differently? If he had asked in a\nfriendly way, \u201cWhose car is in the driveway?\u201d and then suggested\nthat if it were moved, other cars could get in and out, the student\nwould have gladly moved it and neither he nor his classmates would\nhave been upset and resentful.\nAsking questions not only makes an order more palatable; it often\nstimulates the creativity of the persons whom you ask. People are\nmore likely to accept an order if they have had a part in the decision\nthat caused the order to be issued.\nWhen Ian Macdonald of Johannesburg, South Africa, the general\nmanager of a small manufacturing plant specializing in precision\nmachine parts, had the opportunity to accept a very large order, he\nwas convinced that he would not meet the promised delivery date.\nThe work already scheduled in the shop and the short completion\ntime needed for this order made it seem impossible for him to accept\nthe order.\nInstead of pushing his people to accelerate their work and rush the\norder through, he called everybody together, explained the situation\nto them, and told them how much it would mean to the company and\nto them if they could make it possible to produce the order on time.\nThen he started asking questions:\n\u201cIs there anything we can do to handle this order?\u201d\n\u201cCan anyone think of different ways to process it through the shop\nthat will make it possible to take the order?\u201d\n\u201cIs there any way to adjust our hours or personnel assignments\nthat would help?\u201d\nThe employees came up with many ideas and insisted that he take\nthe order. They approached it with a \u201cWe can do it\u201d attitude, and the\norder was accepted, produced and delivered on time.\nAn effective leader will use . . .\nPRINCIPLE 4\nAsk questions instead of giving direct orders.\n5\nLet the Other Person Save Face\nYears ago the General Electric Company was faced with the delicate\ntask of removing Charles Steinmetz from the head of a department.\nSteinmetz, a genius of the first magnitude when it came to electricity,\nwas a failure as the head of the calculating department. Yet the\ncompany didn\u2019t dare offend the man. He was indispensable\u2014and\nhighly sensitive. So they gave him a new title. They made him\nConsulting Engineer of the General Electric Company\u2014a new title\nfor work he was already doing\u2014and let someone else head up the\ndepartment.\nSteinmetz was happy.\nSo were the officers of G.E. They had gently maneuvered their\nmost temperamental star, and they had done it without a storm\u2014by\nletting him save face.\nLetting one save face! How important, how vitally important that is!\nAnd how few of us ever stop to think of it! We ride roughshod over\nthe feelings of others, getting our own way, finding fault, issuing\nthreats, criticizing a child or an employee in front of others, without\neven considering the hurt to the other person\u2019s pride. Whereas a few\nminutes\u2019 thought, a considerate word or two, a genuine\nunderstanding of the other person\u2019s attitude, would go so far toward\nalleviating the sting!\nLet\u2019s remember that the next time we are faced with the distasteful\nnecessity of discharging or reprimanding an employee.\n\u201cFiring employees is not much fun. Getting fired is even less fun.\u201d\n(I\u2019m quoting now from a letter written me by Marshall A. Granger, a\ncertified public accountant.) \u201cOur business is mostly seasonal.\nTherefore we have to let a lot of people go after the income tax rush\nis over.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a byword in our profession that no one enjoys wielding the ax.\nConsequently, the custom has developed of getting it over as soon\nas possible, and usually in the following way: \u2018Sit down, Mr. Smith.\nThe season\u2019s over, and we don\u2019t seem to see any more assignments\nfor you. Of course, you understood you were only employed for the\nbusy season anyhow, etc., etc.\u2019\n\u201cThe effect on these people is one of disappointment and a feeling\nof being \u2018let down.\u2019 Most of them are in the accounting field for life,\nand they retain no particular love for the firm that, drops them so\ncasually.\n\u201cI recently decided to let our seasonal personnel go with a little\nmore tact and consideration. So I call each one in only after carefully\nthinking over his or her work during the winter. And I\u2019ve said\nsomething like this: \u2018Mr. Smith, you\u2019ve done a fine job (if he has).\nThat time we sent you to Newark, you had a tough assignment. You\nwere on the spot, but you came through with flying colors, and we\nwant you to know the firm is proud of you. You\u2019ve got the stuff\u2014\nyou\u2019re going a long way, wherever you\u2019re working. This firm believes\nin you, and is rooting for you, and we don\u2019t want you to forget it.\u2019\n\u201cEffect? The people go away feeling a lot better about being fired.\nThey don\u2019t feel \u2018let down.\u2019 They know if we had work for them, we\u2019d\nkeep them on. And when we need them again, they come to us with\na keen personal affection.\u201d\nAt one session of our course, two class members discussed the\nnegative effects of faultfinding versus the positive effects of letting\nthe other person save face.\nFred Clark of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, told of an incident that\noccurred in his company: \u201cAt one of our production meetings, a vice\npresident was asking very pointed questions of one of our production\nsupervisors regarding a production process. His tone of voice was\naggressive and aimed at pointing out faulty performance on the part\nof the supervisor. Not wanting to be embarrassed in front of his\npeers, the supervisor was evasive in his responses. This caused the\nvice president to lose his temper, berate the supervisor and accuse\nhim of lying.\n\u201cAny working relationship that might have existed prior to this\nencounter was destroyed in a few brief moments. This supervisor,\nwho was basically a good worker, was useless to our company from\nthat time on. A few months later he left our firm and went to work for\na competitor, where I understand he is doing a fine job.\u201d\nAnother class member, Anna Mazzone, related how a similar\nincident had occurred at her job\u2014but what a difference in approach\nand results! Ms. Mazzone, a marketing specialist for a food packer,\nwas given her first major assignment\u2014the test-marketing of a new\nproduct. She told the class: \u201cWhen the results of the test came in, I\nwas devastated. I had made a serious error in my planning, and the\nentire test had to be done all over again. To make this worse, I had\nno time to discuss it with my boss before the meeting in which I was\nto make my report on the project.\n\u201cWhen I was called on to give the report, I was shaking with fright. I\nhad all I could do to keep from breaking down, but I resolved I would\nnot cry and have all those men make remarks about women not\nbeing able to handle a management job because they are too\nemotional. I made my report briefly and stated that due to an error I\nwould repeat the study before the next meeting. I sat down,\nexpecting my boss to blow up.\n\u201cInstead, he thanked me for my work and remarked that it was not\nunusual for a person to make an error on a new project and that he\nhad confidence that the repeat survey would be accurate and\nmeaningful to the company. He assured me, in front of all my\ncolleagues, that he had faith in me and knew I had done my best,\nand that my lack of experience, not my lack of ability, was the reason\nfor the failure.\n\u201cI left that meeting with my head up in the air and with the\ndetermination that I would never let that boss of mine down again.\u201d\nEven if we are right and the other person is definitely wrong, we\nonly destroy ego by causing someone to lose face. The legendary\nFrench aviation pioneer and author Antoine de Saint-Exup\xe9ry wrote:\n\u201cI have no right to say or do anything that diminishes a man in his\nown eyes. What matters is not what I think of him, but what he thinks\nof himself. Hurting a man in his dignity is a crime.\u201d\nA real leader will always follow . . .\nPRINCIPLE 5\nLet the other person save face.\n6\nHow to Spur People On to Success\nPete Barlow was an old friend of mine. He had a dog-and-pony act\nand spent his life traveling with circuses and vaudeville shows. I\nloved to watch Pete train new dogs for his act. I noticed that the\nmoment a dog showed the slightest improvement, Pete patted and\npraised him and gave him meat and made a great to-do about it.\nThat\u2019s nothing new. Animal trainers have been using that same\ntechnique for centuries.\nWhy, I wonder, don\u2019t we use the same common sense when trying\nto change people that we use when trying to change dogs? Why\ndon\u2019t we use meat instead of a whip? Why don\u2019t we use praise\ninstead of condemnation? Let us praise even the slightest\nimprovement. That inspires the other person to keep on improving.\nIn his book I Ain\u2019t Much, Baby\u2014But I\u2019m All I Got, the psychologist\nJess Lair comments: \u201cPraise is like sunlight to the warm human\nspirit; we cannot flower and grow without it. And yet, while most of us\nare only too ready to apply to others the cold wind of criticism, we\nare somehow reluctant to give our fellow the warm sunshine of\npraise.\u201d*\nI can look back at my own life and see where a few words of praise\nhave sharply changed my entire future. Can\u2019t you say the same thing\nabout your life? History is replete with striking illustrations of the\nsheer witchery of praise.\nFor example, many years ago a boy of ten was working in a factory\nin Naples. He longed to be a singer, but his first teacher discouraged\nhim. \u201cYou can\u2019t sing,\u201d he said. \u201cYou haven\u2019t any voice at all. It sounds\nlike the wind in the shutters.\u201d\nBut his mother, a poor peasant woman, put her arms about him\nand praised him and told him she knew he could sing, she could\nalready see an improvement, and she went barefoot in order to save\nmoney to pay for his music lessons. That peasant mother\u2019s praise\nand encouragement changed that boy\u2019s life. His name was Enrico\nCaruso, and he became the greatest and most famous opera singer\nof his age.\nIn the early nineteenth century, a young man in London aspired to\nbe a writer. But everything seemed to be against him. He had never\nbeen able to attend school more than four years. His father had been\nflung in jail because he couldn\u2019t pay his debts, and this young man\noften knew the pangs of hunger. Finally, he got a job pasting labels\non bottles of blacking in a rat-infested warehouse, and he slept at\nnight in a dismal attic room with two other boys\u2014guttersnipes from\nthe slums of London. He had so little confidence in his ability to write\nthat he sneaked out and mailed his first manuscript in the dead of\nnight so nobody would laugh at him. Story after story was refused.\nFinally the great day came when one was accepted. True, he wasn\u2019t\npaid a shilling for it, but one editor had praised him. One editor had\ngiven him recognition. He was so thrilled that he wandered aimlessly\naround the streets with tears rolling down his cheeks.\nThe praise, the recognition, that he received through getting one\nstory in print, changed his whole life, for if it hadn\u2019t been for that\nencouragement, he might have spent his entire life working in rat\x02infested factories. You may have heard of that boy. His name was\nCharles Dickens.\nAnother boy in London made his living as a clerk in a dry-goods\nstore. He had to get up at five o\u2019clock, sweep out the store, and\nslave for fourteen hours a day. It was sheer drudgery and he\ndespised it. After two years, he could stand it no longer, so he got up\none morning and, without waiting for breakfast, tramped fifteen miles\nto talk to his mother, who was working as a housekeeper.\nHe was frantic. He pleaded with her. He wept. He swore he would\nkill himself if he had to remain in the shop any longer. Then he wrote\na long, pathetic letter to his old schoolmaster, declaring that he was\nheartbroken, that he no longer wanted to live. His old schoolmaster\ngave him a little praise and assured him that he really was very\nintelligent and fitted for finer things and offered him a job as a\nteacher.\nThat praise changed the future of that boy and made a lasting\nimpression on the history of English literature. For that boy went on\nto write innumerable bestselling books and made over a million\ndollars with his pen. You\u2019ve probably heard of him. His name: H. G.\nWells.\nUse of praise instead of criticism is the basic concept of B. F.\nSkinner\u2019s teachings. This great contemporary psychologist has\nshown by experiments with animals and with humans that when\ncriticism is minimized and praise emphasized, the good things\npeople do will be reinforced and the poorer things will atrophy for\nlack of attention.\nJohn Ringelspaugh of Rocky Mount, North Carolina, used this in\ndealing with his children. It seemed that, as in so many families,\nmother and dad\u2019s chief form of communication with the children was\nyelling at them. And, as in so many cases, the children became a\nlittle worse rather than better after each such session\u2014and so did\nthe parents. There seemed to be no end in sight for this problem.\nMr. Ringelspaugh determined to use some of the principles he was\nlearning in our course to solve this situation. He reported: \u201cWe\ndecided to try praise instead of harping on their faults. It wasn\u2019t easy\nwhen all we could see were the negative things they were doing; it\nwas really tough to find things to praise. We managed to find\nsomething, and within the first day or two some of the really\nupsetting things they were doing quit happening. Then some of their\nother faults began to disappear. They began capitalizing on the\npraise we were giving them. They even began going out of their way\nto do things right. Neither of us could believe it. Of course, it didn\u2019t\nlast forever, but the norm reached after things leveled off was so\nmuch better. It was no longer necessary to react the way we used to.\nThe children were doing far more right things than wrong ones.\u201d All\nof this was a result of praising the slightest improvement in the\nchildren rather than condemning everything they did wrong.\nThis works on the job too. Keith Roper of Woodland Hills,\nCalifornia, applied this principle to a situation in his company. Some\nmaterial came to him in his print shop which was of exceptionally\nhigh quality. The printer who had done this job was a new employee\nwho had been having difficulty adjusting to the job. His supervisor\nwas upset about what he considered a negative attitude and was\nseriously thinking of terminating his services.\nWhen Mr. Roper was informed of this situation, he personally went\nover to the print shop and had a talk with the young man. He told him\nhow pleased he was with the work he had just received and pointed\nout it was the best work he had seen produced in that shop for some\ntime. He pointed out exactly why it was superior and how important\nthe young man\u2019s contribution was to the company.\nDo you think this affected that young printer\u2019s attitude toward the\ncompany? Within days there was a complete turnabout. He told\nseveral of his co-workers about the conversation and how someone\nin the company really appreciated good work. And from that day on,\nhe was a loyal and dedicated worker.\nWhat Mr. Roper did was not just flatter the young printer and say\n\u201cYou\u2019re good.\u201d He specifically pointed out how his work was superior.\nBecause he had singled out a specific accomplishment, rather than\njust making general flattering remarks, his praise became much\nmore meaningful to the person to whom it was given. Everybody\nlikes to be praised, but when praise is specific, it comes across as\nsincere\u2014not something the other person may be saying just to make\none feel good.\nRemember, we all crave appreciation and recognition, and will do\nalmost anything to get it. But nobody wants insincerity. Nobody\nwants flattery.\nLet me repeat: The principles taught in this book will work only\nwhen they come from the heart. I am not advocating a bag of tricks. I\nam talking about a new way of life.\nTalk about changing people. If you and I will inspire the people with\nwhom we come in contact to a realization of the hidden treasures\nthey possess, we can do far more than change people. We can\nliterally transform them.\nExaggeration? Then listen to these sage words from William\nJames, one of the most distinguished psychologists and\nphilosophers America has ever produced:\nCompared with what we ought to be, we are only half awake. We\nare making use of only a small part of our physical and mental\nresources. Stating the thing broadly, the human individual thus lives\nfar within his limits. He possesses powers of various sorts which he\nhabitually fails to use.\nYes, you who are reading these lines possess powers of various\nsorts which you habitually fail to use; and one of these powers you\nare probably not using to the fullest extent is your magic ability to\npraise people and inspire them with a realization of their latent\npossibilities.\nAbilities wither under criticism; they blossom under\nencouragement. To become a more effective leader of people, apply\n. . .\nPRINCIPLE 6\nPraise the slightest improvement and praise\nevery improvement.

You can fire him or her, but that really\ndoesn\u2019t solve anything. You can berate the worker, but this usually\ncauses resentment. Henry Henke, a service manager for a large\ntruck dealership in Lowell, Indiana, had a mechanic whose work had\nbecome less than satisfactory. Instead of bawling him out or\nthreatening him, Mr. Henke called him into his office and had a heart\x02to-heart talk with him.\n\u201cBill,\u201d he said, \u201cyou are a fine mechanic. You have been in this line\nof work for a good number of years. You have repaired many\nvehicles to the customers\u2019 satisfaction. In fact, we\u2019ve had a number\nof compliments about the good work you have done. Yet, of late, the\ntime you take to complete each job has been increasing and your\nwork has not been up to your own old standards. Because you have\nbeen such an outstanding mechanic in the past, I felt sure you would\nwant to know that I am not happy with this situation, and perhaps\njointly we could find some way to correct the problem.\u201d\nBill responded that he hadn\u2019t realized he had been falling down in\nhis duties and assured his boss that the work he was getting was not\nout of his range of expertise and he would try to improve in the\nfuture.\nDid he do it? You can be sure he did. He once again became a fast\nand thorough mechanic. With that reputation Mr. Henke had given\nhim to live up to, how could he do anything else but turn out work\ncomparable to that which he had done in the past.\n\u201cThe average person,\u201d said Samuel Vauclain, then president of the\nBaldwin Locomotive Works, \u201ccan be led readily if you have his or her\nrespect and if you show that you respect that person for some kind\nof ability.\u201d\nIn short, if you want to improve a person in a certain respect, act as\nthough that particular trait were already one of his or her outstanding\ncharacteristics. Shakespeare said, \u201cAssume a virtue, if you have it\nnot.\u201d And it might be well to assume and state openly that other\npeople have the virtue you want them to develop. Give them a fine\nreputation to live up to, and they will make prodigious efforts rather\nthan see you disillusioned.\nGeorgette Leblanc, in her book Souvenirs, My Life with\nMaeterlinck, describes the startling transformation of a humble\nBelgian Cinderella.\n\u201cA servant girl from a neighboring hotel brought my meals,\u201d she\nwrote. \u201cShe was called \u2018Marie the Dishwasher\u2019 because she had\nstarted her career as a scullery assistant. She was a kind of monster,\ncross-eyed, bandy-legged, poor in flesh and spirit.\n\u201cOne day, while she was holding my plate of macaroni in her red\nhand, I said to her point-blank, \u2018Marie, you do not know what\ntreasures are within you.\u2019\n\u201cAccustomed to holding back her emotion, Marie waited a few\nmoments, not daring to risk the slightest gesture for fear of a\ncatastrophe. Then she put the dish on the table, sighed and said\ningenuously, \u2018Madame, I would never have believed it.\u2019 She did not\ndoubt, she did not ask a question. She simply went back to the\nkitchen and repeated what I had said, and such is the force of faith\nthat no one made fun of her. From that day on, she was even given a\ncertain consideration. But the most curious change of all occurred in\nthe humble Marie herself. Believing she was the tabernacle of\nunseen marvels, she began taking care of her face and body so\ncarefully that her starved youth seemed to bloom and modestly hide\nher plainness.\n\u201cTwo months later, she announced her coming marriage with the\nnephew of the chef. \u2018I\u2019m going to be a lady,\u2019 she said, and thanked\nme. A small phrase had changed her entire life.\u201d\nGeorgette Leblanc had given \u201cMarie the Dishwasher\u201d a reputation\nto live up to\u2014and that reputation had transformed her.\nBill Parker, a sales representative for a food company in Daytona\nBeach, Florida, was very excited about the new line of products his\ncompany was introducing and was upset when the manager of a\nlarge independent food market turned down the opportunity to carry\nit in his store. Bill brooded all day over this rejection and decided to\nreturn to the store before he went home that evening and try again.\n\u201cJack,\u201d he said, \u201csince I left this morning I realized I hadn\u2019t given\nyou the entire picture of our new line, and I would appreciate some\nof your time to tell you about the points I omitted. I have respected\nthe fact that you are always willing to listen and are big enough to\nchange your mind when the facts warrant a change.\u201d\nCould Jack refuse to give him another hearing? Not with that\nreputation to live up to.\nOne morning Dr. Martin Fitzhugh, a dentist in Dublin, Ireland, was\nshocked when one of his patients pointed out to him that the metal\ncup holder which she was using to rinse her mouth was not very\nclean. True, the patient drank from the paper cup, not the holder, but\nit certainly was not professional to use tarnished equipment.\nWhen the patient left, Dr. Fitzhugh retreated to his private office to\nwrite a note to Bridgit, the charwoman, who came twice a week to\nclean his office. He wrote:\nMy dear Bridgit,\nI see you so seldom, I thought I\u2019d take the time to thank you for\nthe fine job of cleaning you\u2019ve been doing. By the way, I thought\nI\u2019d mention that since two hours, twice a week, is a very limited\namount of time, please feel free to work an extra half hour from\ntime to time if you feel you need to do those \u201conce-in-a-while\u201d\nthings like polishing the cup holders and the like. I, of course, will\npay you for the extra time.\n\u201cThe next day, when I walked into my office,\u201d Dr. Fitzhugh reported,\n\u201cmy desk had been polished to a mirror-like finish, as had my chair,\nwhich I nearly slid out of. When I went into the treatment room I\nfound the shiniest, cleanest chrome-plated cup holder I had ever\nseen nestled in its receptacle. I had given my charwoman a fine\nreputation to live up to, and because of this small gesture she\noutperformed all her past efforts. How much additional time did she\nspend on this? That\u2019s right\u2014none at all.\u201d\nThere is an old saying: \u201cGive a dog a bad name and you may as\nwell hang him.\u201d But give him a good name\u2014and see what happens!\nWhen Mrs. Ruth Hopkins, a fourth-grade teacher in Brooklyn, New\nYork, looked at her class roster the first day of school, her excitement\nand joy of starting a new term was tinged with anxiety. In her class\nthis year she would have Tommy T., the school\u2019s most notorious \u201cbad\nboy.\u201d His third-grade teacher had constantly complained about\nTommy to colleagues, the principal and anyone else who would\nlisten. He was not just mischievous; he caused serious discipline\nproblems in the class, picked fights with the boys, teased the girls,\nwas fresh to the teacher, and seemed to get worse as he grew older.\nHis only redeeming feature was his ability to learn rapidly and master\nthe school work easily.\nMrs. Hopkins decided to face the \u201cTommy problem\u201d immediately.\nWhen she greeted her new students, she made little comments to\neach of them: \u201cRose, that\u2019s a pretty dress you are wearing,\u201d \u201cAlicia, I\nhear you draw beautifully.\u201d When she came to Tommy, she looked\nhim straight in the eyes and said, \u201cTommy, I understand you are a\nnatural leader. I\u2019m going to depend on you to help me make this\nclass the best class in the fourth grade this year.\u201d She reinforced this\nover the first few days by complimenting Tommy on everything he\ndid and commenting on how this showed what a good student he\nwas. With that reputation to live up to, even a nine-year-old couldn\u2019t\nlet her down\u2014and he didn\u2019t.\nIf you want to excel in that difficult leadership role of changing the\nattitude or behavior of others, use . . .\nPRINCIPLE 7\nGive the other person a fine reputation to live\nup to.\n8\nMake the Fault Seem Easy to Correct\nA bachelor friend of mine, about forty years old, became engaged,\nand his fianc\xe9e persuaded him to take some belated dancing\nlessons. \u201cThe Lord knows I needed dancing lessons,\u201d he confessed\nas he told me the story, \u201cfor I danced just as I did when I first started\ntwenty years ago. The first teacher I engaged probably told me the\ntruth. She said I was all wrong; I would just have to forget everything\nand begin all over again. But that took the heart out of me. I had no\nincentive to go on. So I quit her.\n\u201cThe next teacher may have been lying, but I liked it. She said\nnonchalantly that my dancing was a bit old-fashioned perhaps, but\nthe fundamentals were all right, and she assured me I wouldn\u2019t have\nany trouble learning a few new steps. The first teacher had\ndiscouraged me by emphasizing my mistakes. This new teacher did\nthe opposite. She kept praising the things I did right and minimizing\nmy errors. \u2018You have a natural sense of rhythm,\u2019 she assured me.\n\u2018You really are a natural-born dancer.\u2019 Now my common sense tells\nme that I always have been and always will be a fourth-rate dancer;\nyet, deep in my heart, I still like to think that maybe she meant it. To\nbe sure, I was paying her to say it; but why bring that up?\n\u201cAt any rate, I know I am a better dancer than I would have been if\nshe hadn\u2019t told me I had a natural sense of rhythm. That encouraged\nme. That gave me hope. That made me want to improve.\u201d\nTell your child, your spouse, or your employee that he or she is\nstupid or dumb at a certain thing, has no gift for it, and is doing it all\nwrong, and you have destroyed almost every incentive to try to\nimprove. But use the opposite technique\u2014be liberal with your\nencouragement, make the thing seem easy to do, let the other\nperson know that you have faith in his ability to do it, that he has an\nundeveloped flair for it\u2014and he will practice until the dawn comes in\nthe window in order to excel.\nLowell Thomas, a superb artist in human relations, used this\ntechnique. He gave you confidence, inspired you with courage and\nfaith. For example, I spent a weekend with Mr. and Mrs. Thomas;\nand on Saturday night, I was asked to sit in on a friendly bridge\ngame before a roaring fire. Bridge? Oh, no! No! No! Not me. I knew\nnothing about it. The game had always been a black mystery to me.\nNo! No! Impossible!\n\u201cWhy, Dale, it is no trick at all,\u201d Lowell replied. \u201cThere is nothing to\nbridge except memory and judgment. You\u2019ve written articles on\nmemory. Bridge will be a cinch for you. It\u2019s right up your alley.\u201d\nAnd presto, almost before I realized what I was doing, I found\nmyself for the first time at a bridge table. All because I was told I had\na natural flair for it and the game was made to seem easy.\nSpeaking of bridge reminds me of Ely Culbertson, whose books on\nbridge have been translated into a dozen languages and have sold\nmore than a million copies. Yet he told me he never would have\nmade a profession out of the game if a certain young woman hadn\u2019t\nassured him he had a flair for it.\nWhen he came to America in 1922, he tried to get a job teaching in\nphilosophy and sociology, but he couldn\u2019t.\nThen he tried selling coal, and he failed at that.\nThen he tried selling coffee, and he failed at that, too.\nHe had played some bridge, but it had never occurred to him in\nthose days that someday he would teach it. He was not only a poor\ncard player, but he was also very stubborn. He asked so many\nquestions and held so many post-mortem examinations that no one\nwanted to play with him.\nThen he met a pretty bridge teacher, Josephine Dillon, fell in love\nand married her. She noticed how carefully he analyzed his cards\nand persuaded him that he was a potential genius at the card table.\nIt was that encouragement and that alone, Culbertson told me, that\ncaused him to make a profession of bridge.\nClarence M. Jones, one of the instructors of our course in\nCincinnati, Ohio, told how encouragement and making faults seem\neasy to correct completely changed the life of his son.\n\u201cIn 1970 my son David, who was then fifteen years old, came to\nlive with me in Cincinnati. He had led a rough life. In 1958 his head\nwas cut open in a car accident, leaving a very bad scar on his\nforehead. In 1960 his mother and I were divorced and he moved to\nDallas, Texas, with his mother. Until he was fifteen he had spent\nmost of his school years in special classes for slow learners in the\nDallas school system. Possibly because of the scar, school\nadministrators had decided he was brain-injured and could not\nfunction at a normal level. He was two years behind his age group,\nso he was only in the seventh grade. Yet he did not know his\nmultiplication tables, added on his fingers and could barely read.\n\u201cThere was one positive point. He loved to work on radio and TV\nsets. He wanted to become a TV technician. I encouraged this and\npointed out that he needed math to qualify for the training. I decided\nto help him become proficient in this subject. We obtained four sets\nof flash cards: multiplication, division, addition and subtraction. As\nwe went through the cards, we put the correct answers in a discard\nstack. When David missed one, I gave him the correct answer and\nthen put the card in the repeat stack until there were no cards left. I\nmade a big deal out of each card he got right, particularly if he had\nmissed it previously. Each night we would go through the repeat\nstack until there were no cards left. Each night we timed the exercise\nwith a stop watch. I promised him that when he could get all the\ncards correct in eight minutes with no incorrect answers, we would\nquit doing it every night. This seemed an impossible goal to David.\nThe first night it took 52 minutes, the second night, 48, then 45, 44,\n41, then under 40 minutes. We celebrated each reduction. I\u2019d call in\nmy wife, and we would both hug him and we\u2019d all dance a jig. At the\nend of the month he was doing all the cards perfectly in less than\neight minutes. When he made a small improvement he would ask to\ndo it again. He had made the fantastic discovery that learning was\neasy and fun.\n\u201cNaturally his grades in algebra took a jump. It is amazing how\nmuch easier algebra is when you can multiply. He astonished himself\nby bringing home a B in math. That had never happened before.\nOther changes came with almost unbelievable rapidity. His reading\nimproved rapidly, and he began to use his natural talents in drawing.\nLater in the school year his science teacher assigned him to develop\nan exhibit. He chose to develop a highly complex series of models to\ndemonstrate the effect of levers. It required skill not only in drawing\nand model making but in applied mathematics. The exhibit took first\nprize in his school\u2019s science fair and was entered in the city\ncompetition and won third prize for the entire city of Cincinnati.\n\u201cThat did it. Here was a kid who had flunked two grades, who had\nbeen told he was \u2018brain-damaged,\u2019 who had been called\n\u2018Frankenstein\u2019 by his classmates and told his brains must have\nleaked out of the cut on his head. Suddenly he discovered he could\nreally learn and accomplish things. The result? From the last quarter\nof the eighth grade all the way through high school, he never failed\nto make the honor roll; in high school he was elected to the national\nhonor society. Once he found learning was easy, his whole life\nchanged.\u201d\nIf you want to help others to improve, remember . . .\nPRINCIPLE 8\nUse encouragement. Make the fault seem\neasy to correct.\n9\nMaking People Glad to Do What You Want\nBack in 1915, America was aghast. For more than a year, the\nnations of Europe had been slaughtering one another on a scale\nnever before dreamed of in all the bloody annals of mankind. Could\npeace be brought about? No one knew. But Woodrow Wilson was\ndetermined to try. He would send a personal representative, a peace\nemissary, to counsel with the warlords of Europe.\nWilliam Jennings Bryan, Secretary of State, Bryan, the peace\nadvocate, longed to go. He saw a chance to perform a great service\nand make his name immortal. But Wilson appointed another man,\nhis intimate friend and advisor Colonel Edward M. House; and it was\nHouse\u2019s thorny task to break the unwelcome news to Bryan without\ngiving him offense.\n\u201cBryan was distinctly disappointed when he heard I was to go to\nEurope as the peace emissary,\u201d Colonel House records in his diary.\n\u201cHe said he had planned to do this himself . . .\n\u201cI replied that the President thought it would be unwise for anyone\nto do this officially, and that his going would attract a great deal of\nattention and people would wonder why he was there. . . .\u201d\nYou see the intimation? House practically told Bryan that he was\ntoo important for the job\u2014and Bryan was satisfied.\nColonel House, adroit, experienced in the ways of the world, was\nfollowing one of the important rules of human relations: Always make\nthe other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.\nWoodrow Wilson followed that policy even when inviting William\nGibbs McAdoo to become a member of his cabinet. That was the\nhighest honor he could confer upon anyone, and yet Wilson\nextended the invitation in such a way as to make McAdoo feel\ndoubly important. Here is the story in McAdoo\u2019s own words: \u201cHe\n","[Wilson]"," said that he was making up his cabinet and that he would\nbe very glad if I would accept a place in it as Secretary of the\nTreasury. He had a delightful way of putting things; he created the\nimpression that by accepting this great honor I would be doing him a\nfavor.\u201d\nUnfortunately, Wilson didn\u2019t always employ such tact. If he had,\nhistory might have been different. For example, Wilson didn\u2019t make\nthe Senate and the Republican Party happy by entering the United\nStates in the League of Nations. Wilson refused to take such\nprominent Republican leaders as Elihu Root or Charles Evans\nHughes or Henry Cabot Lodge to the peace conference with him.\nInstead, he took along unknown men from his own party. He\nsnubbed the Republicans, refused to let them feel that the League\nwas their idea as well as his, refused to let them have a finger in the\npie; and, as a result of this crude handling of human relations,\nwrecked his own career, ruined his health, shortened his life, caused\nAmerica to stay out of the League, and altered the history of the\nworld.\nStatesmen and diplomats aren\u2019t the only ones who use this make\x02a-person-happy-to-do-things-you-want-them-to-do approach. Dale\nO. Ferrier of Fort Wayne, Indiana, told how he encouraged one of his\nyoung children to willingly do the chore he was assigned.\n\u201cOne of Jeff\u2019s chores was to pick up pears from under the pear tree\nso the person who was mowing underneath wouldn\u2019t have to stop to\npick them up. He didn\u2019t like this chore, and frequently it was either\nnot done at all or it was done so poorly that the mower had to stop\nand pick up several pears that he had missed. Rather than have an\neyeball-to-eyeball confrontation about it, one day I said to him: \u2018Jeff,\nI\u2019ll make a deal with you. For every bushel basket full of pears you\npick up, I\u2019ll pay you one dollar. But after you are finished, for every\npear I find left in the yard, I\u2019ll take away a dollar. How does that\nsound?\u2019 As you would expect, he not only picked up all of the pears,\nbut I had to keep an eye on him to see that he didn\u2019t pull a few off\nthe trees to fill up some of the baskets.\u201d\nI knew a man who had to refuse many invitations to speak,\ninvitations extended by friends, invitations coming from people to\nwhom he was obligated; and yet he did it so adroitly that the other\nperson was at least contended with his refusal. How did he do it?\nNot by merely talking about the fact that he was too busy and too-\nthis and too-that. No, after expressing his appreciation of the\ninvitation and regretting his inability to accept it, he suggested a\nsubstitute speaker. In other words, he didn\u2019t give the other person\nany time to feel unhappy about the refusal. He immediately changed\nthe other person\u2019s thoughts to some other speaker who could accept\nthe invitation.\nGunter Schmidt, who took our course in West Germany, told of an\nemployee in the food store he managed who was negligent about\nputting the proper price tags on the shelves where the items were\ndisplayed. This caused confusion and customer complaints.\nReminders, admonitions, confrontations with her about this did not\ndo much good. Finally, Mr. Schmidt called her into his office and told\nher he was appointing her Supervisor of Price Tag Posting for the\nentire store and she would be responsible for keeping all of the\nshelves properly tagged. This new responsibility and title changed\nher attitude completely, and she fulfilled her duties satisfactorily from\nthen on.\nChildish? Perhaps. But that is what they said to Napoleon when he\ncreated the Legion of Honor and distributed 15,000 crosses to his\nsoldiers and made eighteen of his generals \u201cMarshals of France\u201d and\ncalled his troops the \u201cGrand Army.\u201d Napoleon was criticized for\ngiving \u201ctoys\u201d to war-hardened veterans, and Napoleon replied, \u201cMen\nare ruled by toys.\u201d\nThis technique of giving titles and authority worked for Napoleon\nand it will work for you. For example, a friend of mine, Mrs. Ernest\nGent of Scarsdale, New York, was troubled by boys running across\nand destroying her lawn. She tried criticism. She tried coaxing.\nNeither worked. Then she tried giving the worst sinner in the gang a\ntitle and a feeling of authority. She made him her \u201cdetective\u201d and put\nhim in charge of keeping all trespassers off her lawn. That solved her\nproblem. Her \u201cdetective\u201d built a bonfire in the backyard, heated an\niron red hot, and threatened to brand any boy who stepped on the\nlawn.\nThe effective leader should keep the following guidelines in mind\nwhen it is necessary to change attitudes or behavior:")),(0,o.kt)("ol",null,(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Be sincere.

It is reprinted in this edition to give the readers\nadditional background on Dale Carnegie.\nIt was a cold January night in 1935, but the weather couldn\u2019t keep\nthem away. Two thousand five hundred men and women thronged\ninto the grand ballroom of the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York. Every\navailable seat was filled by half-past seven. At eight o\u2019clock, the\neager crowd was still pouring in. The spacious balcony was soon\njammed. Presently even standing space was at a premium, and\nhundreds of people, tired after navigating a day in business, stood\nup for an hour and a half that night to witness\u2014what?\nA fashion show?\nA six-day bicycle race or a personal appearance by Clark Gable?\nNo. These people had been lured there by a newspaper ad. Two\nevenings previously, they had seen this full-page announcement in\nthe New York Sun staring them in the face:\nLearn to speak effectively Prepare for leadership\nOld stuff? Yes, but believe it or not, in the most sophisticated town\non earth, during a depression with 20 percent of the population on\nrelief, twenty-five hundred people had left their homes and hustled to\nthe hotel in response to that ad.\nThe people who responded were of the upper economic strata\u2014\nexecutives, employers and professionals.\nThese men and women had come to hear the opening gun of an\nultramodern, ultrapractical course in \u201cEffective Speaking and\nInfluencing Men in Business\u201d\u2014a course given by the Dale Carnegie\nInstitute of Effective Speaking and Human Relations.\nWhy were they there, these twenty-five hundred business men and\nwomen?\nBecause of a sudden hunger for more education because of the\ndepression?\nApparently not, for this same course had been playing to packed\nhouses in New York City every season for the preceding twenty-four\nyears. During that time, more than fifteen thousand business and\nprofessional people had been trained by Dale Carnegie. Even large,\nskeptical, conservative organizations such as the Westinghouse\nElectric Company, the McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, the\nBrooklyn Union Gas Company, the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce,\nthe American Institute of Electrical Engineers and the New York\nTelephone Company have had this training conducted in their own\noffices for the benefit of their members and executives.\nThe fact that these people, ten or twenty years after leaving grade\nschool, high school or college, come and take this training is a\nglaring commentary on the shocking deficiencies of our educational\nsystem.\nWhat do adults really want to study? That is an important question;\nand, in order to answer it, the University of Chicago, the American\nAssociation for Adult Education, and the United Y.M.C.A. Schools\nmade a survey over a two-year period.\nThat survey revealed that the prime interest of adults is health. It\nalso revealed that their second interest is in developing skill in\nhuman relationships\u2014they want to learn the technique of getting\nalong with and influencing other people. They don\u2019t want to become\npublic speakers, and they don\u2019t want to listen to a lot of high\x02sounding talk about psychology; they want suggestions they can use\nimmediately in business, in social contacts and in the home.\nSo that was what adults wanted to study, was it?\n\u201cAll right,\u201d said the people making the survey. \u201cFine. If that is what\nthey want, we\u2019ll give it to them.\u201d\nLooking around for a textbook, they discovered that no working\nmanual had ever been written to help people solve their daily\nproblems in human relationships.\nHere was a fine kettle of fish! For hundreds of years, learned\nvolumes had been written on Greek and Latin and higher\nmathematics\u2014topics about which the average adult doesn\u2019t give two\nhoots. But on the one subject on which he has a thirst for knowledge,\na veritable passion for guidance and help\u2014nothing!\nThis explained the presence of twenty-five hundred eager adults\ncrowding into the grand ballroom of the Hotel Pennsylvania in\nresponse to a newspaper advertisement. Here, apparently, at last\nwas the thing for which they had long been seeking.\nBack in high school and college, they had pored over books,\nbelieving that knowledge alone was the open sesame to financial\nand professional rewards.\nBut a few years in the rough-and-tumble of business and\nprofessional life had brought sharp disillusionment. They had seen\nsome of the most important business successes won by men who\npossessed, in addition to their knowledge, the ability to talk well, to\nwin people to their way of thinking, and to \u201csell\u201d themselves and their\nideas.\nThey soon discovered that if one aspired to wear the captain\u2019s cap\nand navigate the ship of business, personality and the ability to talk\nare more important than a knowledge of Latin verbs or a sheepskin\nfrom Harvard.\nThe advertisement in the New York Sun promised that the meeting\nwould be highly entertaining. It was.\nEighteen people who had taken the course were marshaled in front\nof the loudspeaker\u2014and fifteen of them were given precisely\nseventy-five seconds each to tell his or her story. Only seventy-five\nseconds of talk, then \u201cbang\u201d went the gavel, and the chairman\nshouted, \u201cTime! Next speaker!\u201d\nThe affair moved with the speed of a herd of buffalo thundering\nacross the plains. Spectators stood for an hour and a half to watch\nthe performance.\nThe speakers were a cross section of life: several sales\nrepresentatives, a chain store executive, a baker, the president of a\ntrade association, two bankers, an insurance agent, an accountant, a\ndentist, an architect, a druggist who had come from Indianapolis to\nNew York to take the course, a lawyer who had come from Havana\nin order to prepare himself to give one important three-minute\nspeech.\nThe first speaker bore the Gaelic name Patrick J. O\u2019Haire. Born in\nIreland, he attended school for only four years, drifted to America,\nworked as a mechanic, then as a chauffeur.\nNow, however, he was forty, he had a growing family and needed\nmore money, so he tried selling trucks. Suffering from an inferiority\ncomplex that, as he put it, was eating his heart out, he had to walk\nup and down in front of an office half a dozen times before he could\nsummon up enough courage to open the door. He was so\ndiscouraged as a salesman that he was thinking of going back to\nworking with his hands in a machine shop, when one day he\nreceived a letter inviting him to an organization meeting of the Dale\nCarnegie Course in Effective Speaking.\nHe didn\u2019t want to attend. He feared he would have to associate\nwith a lot of college graduates, that he would be out of place.\nHis despairing wife insisted that he go, saying, \u201cIt may do you\nsome good, Pat. God knows you need it.\u201d He went down to the place\nwhere the meeting was to be held and stood on the sidewalk for five\nminutes before he could generate enough self-confidence to enter\nthe room.\nThe first few times he tried to speak in front of the others, he was\ndizzy with fear. But as the weeks drifted by, he lost all fear of\naudiences and soon found that he loved to talk\u2014the bigger the\ncrowd, the better. And he also lost his fear of individuals and of his\nsuperiors. He presented his ideas to them, and soon he had been\nadvanced into the sales department. He had become a valued and\nmuch liked member of his company. This night, in the Hotel\nPennsylvania, Patrick O\u2019Haire stood in front of twenty-five hundred\npeople and told a gay, rollicking story of his achievements. Wave\nafter wave of laughter swept over the audience. Few professional\nspeakers could have equaled his performance.\nThe next speaker, Godfrey Meyer, was a gray-headed banker, the\nfather of eleven children. The first time he had attempted to speak in\nclass, he was literally struck dumb. His mind refused to function. His\nstory is a vivid illustration of how leadership gravitates to the person\nwho can talk.\nHe worked on Wall Street, and for twenty-five years he had been\nliving in Clifton, New Jersey. During that time, he had taken no active\npart in community affairs and knew perhaps five hundred people.\nShortly after he had enrolled in the Carnegie course, he received\nhis tax bill and was infuriated by what he considered unjust charges.\nOrdinarily, he would have sat at home and fumed, or he would have\ntaken it out in grousing to his neighbors. But instead, he put on his\nhat that night, walked into the town meeting, and blew off steam in\npublic.\nAs a result of that talk of indignation, the citizens of Clifton, New\nJersey, urged him to run for the town council. So for weeks he went\nfrom one meeting to another, denouncing waste and municipal\nextravagance.\nThere were ninety-six candidates in the field. When the ballots\nwere counted, lo, Godfrey Meyer\u2019s name led all the rest. Almost\novernight, he had become a public figure among the forty thousand\npeople in his community. As a result of his talks, he made eighty\ntimes more friends in six weeks than he had been able to previously\nin twenty-five years.\nAnd his salary as councilman meant that he got a return of 1,000\npercent a year on his investment in the Carnegie course.\nThe third speaker, the head of a large national association of food\nmanufacturers, told how he had been unable to stand up and\nexpress his ideas at meetings of a board of directors.\nAs a result of learning to think on his feet, two astonishing things\nhappened. He was soon made president of his association, and in\nthat capacity, he was obliged to address meetings all over the United\nStates. Excerpts from his talks were put on the Associated Press\nwires and printed in newspapers and trade magazines throughout\nthe country.\nIn two years, after learning to speak more effectively, he received\nmore free publicity for his company and its products than he had\nbeen able to get previously with a quarter of a million dollars spent in\ndirect advertising. This speaker admitted that he had formerly\nhesitated to telephone some of the more important business\nexecutives in Manhattan and invite them to lunch with him. But as a\nresult of the prestige he had acquired by his talks, these same\npeople telephoned him and invited him to lunch and apologized to\nhim for encroaching on his time.\nThe ability to speak is a shortcut to distinction. It puts a person in\nthe limelight, raises one head and shoulders above the crowd. And\nthe person who can speak acceptably is usually given credit for an\nability out of all proportion to what he or she really possesses.\nA movement for adult education has been sweeping over the\nnation; and the most spectacular force in that movement was Dale\nCarnegie, a man who listened to and critiqued more talks by adults\nthan has any other man in captivity. According to a cartoon by\n\u201cBelieve-It-or-Not\u201d Ripley, he had criticized 150,000 speeches. If that\ngrand total doesn\u2019t impress you, remember that it meant one talk for\nalmost every day that has passed since Columbus discovered\nAmerica. Or, to put it in other words, if all the people who had spoken\nbefore him had used only three minutes and had appeared before\nhim in succession, it would have taken ten months, listening day and\nnight, to hear them all.\nDale Carnegie\u2019s own career, filled with sharp contrasts, was a\nstriking example of what a person can accomplish when obsessed\nwith an original idea and afire with enthusiasm.\nBorn on a Missouri farm ten miles from a railway, he never saw a\nstreetcar until he was twelve years old; yet by the time he was forty\x02six, he was familiar with the far-flung corners of the earth,\neverywhere from Hong Kong to Hammerfest; and, at one time, he\napproached closer to the North Pole than Admiral Byrd\u2019s\nheadquarters at Little America was to the South Pole.\nThis Missouri lad who had once picked strawberries and cut\ncockleburs for five cents an hour became the highly paid trainer of\nthe executives of large corporations in the art of self-expression.\nThis erstwhile cowboy who had once punched cattle and branded\ncalves and ridden fences out in western South Dakota later went to\nLondon to put on shows under the patronage of the royal family.\nThis chap who was a total failure the first half-dozen times he tried\nto speak in public later became my personal manager. Much of my\nsuccess has been due to training under Dale Carnegie.\nYoung Carnegie had to struggle for an education, for hard luck was\nalways battering away at the old farm in northwest Missouri with a\nflying tackle and a body slam. Year after year, the \u201c102\u201d River rose\nand drowned the corn and swept away the hay. Season after\nseason, the fat hogs sickened and died from cholera, the bottom fell\nout of the market for cattle and mules, and the bank threatened to\nforeclose the mortgage.\nSick with discouragement, the family sold out and bought another\nfarm near the State Teachers\u2019 College at Warrensburg, Missouri.\nBoard and room could be had in town for a dollar a day, but young\nCarnegie couldn\u2019t afford it. So he stayed on the farm and commuted\non horseback three miles to college each day. At home, he milked\nthe cows, cut the wood, fed the hogs, and studied his Latin verbs by\nthe light of a coal-oil lamp until his eyes blurred and he began to nod.\nEven when he got to bed at midnight, he set the alarm for three\no\u2019clock. His father bred pedigreed Duroc-Jersey hogs\u2014and there\nwas danger, during the bitter cold nights, that the young pigs would\nfreeze to death; so they were put in a basket, covered with a gunny\nsack, and set behind the kitchen stove. True to their nature, the pigs\ndemanded a hot meal at 3 A.M. So when the alarm went off, Dale\nCarnegie crawled out of the blankets, took the basket of pigs out to\ntheir mother, waited for them to nurse, and then brought them back\nto the warmth of the kitchen stove.\nThere were six hundred students in State Teachers\u2019 College, and\nDale Carnegie was one of the isolated half-dozen who couldn\u2019t afford\nto board in town. He was ashamed of the poverty that made it\nnecessary for him to ride back to the farm and milk the cows every\nnight. He was ashamed of his coat, which was too tight, and his\ntrousers, which were too short. Rapidly developing an inferiority\ncomplex, he looked about for some shortcut to distinction. He soon\nsaw that there were certain groups in college that enjoyed influence\nand prestige\u2014the football and baseball players and the chaps who\nwon the debating and public-speaking contests.\nRealizing that he had no flair for athletics, he decided to win one of\nthe speaking contests. He spent months preparing his talks. He\npracticed as he sat in the saddle galloping to college and back; he\npracticed his speeches as he milked the cows; and then he mounted\na bale of hay in the barn and with great gusto and gestures\nharangued the frightened pigeons about the issues of the day.\nBut in spite of all his earnestness and preparation, he met with\ndefeat after defeat. He was eighteen at the time\u2014sensitive and\nproud. He became so discouraged, so depressed, that he even\nthought of suicide. And then suddenly he began to win, not one\ncontest, but every speaking contest in college.\nOther students pleaded with him to train them; and they won also.\nAfter graduating from college, he started selling correspondence\ncourses to the ranchers among the sand hills of western Nebraska\nand eastern Wyoming. In spite of all his boundless energy and\nenthusiasm, he couldn\u2019t make the grade. He became so discouraged\nthat he went to his hotel room in Alliance, Nebraska, in the middle of\nthe day, threw himself across the bed, and wept in despair. He\nlonged to go back to college, he longed to retreat from the harsh\nbattle of life; but he couldn\u2019t. So he resolved to go to Omaha and get\nanother job. He didn\u2019t have the money for a railroad ticket, so he\ntraveled on a freight train, feeding and watering two carloads of wild\nhorses in return for his passage. After landing in south Omaha, he\ngot a job selling bacon and soap and lard for Armour and Company.\nHis territory was up among the Badlands and the cow and Indian\ncountry of western South Dakota. He covered his territory by freight\ntrain and stage coach and horseback and slept in pioneer hotels\nwhere the only partition between the rooms was a sheet of muslin.\nHe studied books on salesmanship, rode bucking broncos, played\npoker with the Indians, and learned how to collect money. And when,\nfor example, an inland storekeeper couldn\u2019t pay cash for the bacon\nand hams he had ordered, Dale Carnegie would take a dozen pairs\nof shoes off his shelf, sell the shoes to the railroad men, and forward\nthe receipts to Armour and Company.\nHe would often ride a freight train a hundred miles a day. When the\ntrain stopped to unload freight, he would dash uptown, see three or\nfour merchants, get his orders; and when the whistle blew, he would\ndash down the street again lickety-split and swing onto the train\nwhile it was moving.\nWithin two years, he had taken an unproductive territory that had\nstood in the twenty-fifth place and had boosted it to first place among\nall the twenty-nine car routes leading out of South Omaha. Armour\nand Company offered to promote him, saying: \u201cYou have achieved\nwhat seemed impossible.\u201d But he refused the promotion and\nresigned, went to New York, studied at the American Academy of\nDramatic Arts, and toured the country, playing the role of Dr. Hartley\nin Polly of the Circus.\nHe would never be a Booth or a Barrymore. He had the good\nsense to recognize that. So back he went to sales work, selling\nautomobiles and trucks for the Packard Motor Car Company.\nHe knew nothing about machinery and cared nothing about it.\nDreadfully unhappy, he had to scourge himself to his task each day.\nHe longed to have time to study, to write the books he had dreamed\nabout writing back in college. So he resigned. He was going to\nspend his days writing stories and novels and support himself by\nteaching in a night school.\nTeaching what? As he looked back and evaluated his college work,\nhe saw that his training in public speaking had done more to give\nhim confidence, courage, poise and the ability to meet and deal with\npeople in business than had all the rest of his college courses put\ntogether. So he urged the Y.M.C.A. schools in New York to give him\na chance to conduct courses in public speaking for people in\nbusiness.\nWhat? Make orators out of business people? Absurd. The Y.M.C.A.\npeople knew. They had tried such courses\u2014and they had always\nfailed. When they refused to pay him a salary of two dollars a night,\nhe agreed to teach on a commission basis and take a percentage of\nthe net profits\u2014if there were any profits to take. And inside of three\nyears they were paying him thirty dollars a night on that basis\u2014\ninstead of two.\nThe course grew. Other \u201cYs\u201d heard of it, then other cities. Dale\nCarnegie soon became a glorified circuit rider covering New York,\nPhiladelphia, Baltimore and later London and Paris. All the textbooks\nwere too academic and impractical for the business people who\nflocked to his courses. Because of this he wrote his own book\nentitled Public Speaking and Influencing Men in Business. It became\nthe official text of all the Y.M.C.A.s as well as of the American\nBankers\u2019 Association and the National Credit Men\u2019s Association.\nDale Carnegie claimed that all people can talk when they get mad.\nHe said that if you hit the most ignorant man in town on the jaw and\nknock him down, he would get on his feet and talk with an\neloquence, heat and emphasis that would have rivaled that world\nfamous orator William Jennings Bryan at the height of his career. He\nclaimed that almost any person can speak acceptably in public if he\nor she has self-confidence and an idea that is boiling and stewing\nwithin.\nThe way to develop self-confidence, he said, is to do the thing you\nfear to do and get a record of successful experiences behind you. So\nhe forced each class member to talk at every session of the course.\nThe audience is sympathetic. They are all in the same boat; and, by\nconstant practice, they develop a courage, confidence and\nenthusiasm that carry over into their private speaking.\nDale Carnegie would tell you that he made a living all these years,\nnot by teaching public speaking\u2014that was incidental. His main job\nwas to help people conquer their fears and develop courage.\nHe started out at first to conduct merely a course in public\nspeaking, but the students who came were business men and\nwomen. Many of them hadn\u2019t seen the inside of a classroom in thirty\nyears. Most of them were paying their tuition on the installment plan.\nThey wanted results and they wanted them quick\u2014results that they\ncould use the next day in business interviews and in speaking before\ngroups.\nSo he was forced to be swift and practical. Consequently, he\ndeveloped a system of training that is unique\u2014a striking combination\nof public speaking, salesmanship, human relations and applied\npsychology.\nA slave to no hard-and-fast rules, he developed a course that is as\nreal as the measles and twice as much fun.\nWhen the classes terminated, the graduates formed clubs of their\nown and continued to meet fortnightly for years afterward. One group\nof nineteen in Philadelphia met twice a month during the winter\nseason for seventeen years. Class members frequently travel fifty or\na hundred miles to attend classes. One student used to commute\neach week from Chicago to New York.\nProfessor William James of Harvard used to say that the average\nperson develops only 10 percent of his latent mental ability. Dale\nCarnegie, by helping business men and women to develop their\nlatent possibilities, created one of the most significant movements in\nadult education.\nLowell Thomas\n1936\nRecord Your Triumphs Here\nIndex\nAbbott, Lyman, 228\u201329\nAdamson, James, 113\u201316\nAdler, Alfred, 57\nAesop, 161\nAkhtoi, King of Egypt, 140\nAlcott, Louisa May, 188\u201389, 199\nAllison, Joseph, 165\u201367\nAllred, Katherine A., 136\u201337\nAltman, Benjamin, 84\nAmerican Academy of Dramatic Arts, 281\nAmerican Association for Adult Education, 213\nAmos, James E., 59\u201360\nAmos, Mrs. James E., 59\u201360\nAnderson, Barbara, 44\u201345, 47\nArmistead, Gen.
