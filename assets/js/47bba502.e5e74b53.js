A VC once gave me a term sheet as I was walking out of the meeting and pushed me to sign it on the spot. I asked if this was a used car dealership and told him I\u2019d only sign after I read the terms.\nGreedy VCs who will invest only if they can take an outsized piece of your company. Typically a VC needs between 18 and 22 percent to make their model work\u2014step carefully if they begin asking for more. And don\u2019t assume they\u2019re the only game in town\u2014if your gut is telling you to keep looking, then keep looking.\nSome VCs court very inexperienced startups with the intention of pushing them around and telling them what to do rather than allowing the founder and CEO to run the company. Mentorship and advice is one thing; orders that must be obeyed are another.\nSometimes a potential investor sees something interesting in your company\u2014maybe you haven\u2019t received money from the right VCs, or you\u2019re tight on cash, or you have an incredible breakout success. So they\u2019ll propose a really sweet deal, but their terms will screw the other investors who have gotten you this far. We see lots of big and small VCs trying to gain an edge by not playing fair\u2014they may overdilute previous investors or put terms in your deal that scare off new ones. And if things aren\u2019t going well a couple of years down the road, they\u2019ll have no qualms about screwing you, too. So be careful when the terms aren\u2019t standard or seem too good to be true\u2014sometimes it may appear that you\u2019re only giving away a small thing, but if it doesn\u2019t feel right in your gut, it may be that they\u2019re trying to get a foot in the door to start turning the tables against everyone else. They want to control your company sooner or later.\nOne thing that many founders worry about but which isn\u2019t usually a warning sign is if a VC has fired CEOs or founders in the past. Do your research\u2014look at their track record. There are some well-known firms who are so focused on the company that they cut off founders\u2019 heads without giving them a second chance, but most VCs are generally hesitant to remove founders.

Your job will be to create value for investors and ensure you\u2019re hitting major milestones to raise the valuation of the business. That way the next time you raise money you won\u2019t dilute existing investors, employees, or yourself.\nEntrepreneurs think their valuation should always increase, even when they don\u2019t hit the milestones they set out for themselves. But investors are running a business\u2014if you don\u2019t deliver, you don\u2019t get a valuation increase and your own stock position dwindles. You may also need to dilute more because you\u2019ll need to give extra stock to employees to retain them through the hard times.\nDon\u2019t assume you\u2019ll get a valuation like other companies around you. Every investment stands on its own.\nInvestors don\u2019t like to see when founders or executives are \u201cfully vested\u201d\u2014they want to make sure you have skin in the game. You may have to \u201cre-vest\u201d some of the shares you have already to demonstrate your commitment to new investors.\nRemember that investors are going to want references\u2014they\u2019ll want to talk to your customers as part of their due-diligence process. So have a data room with a collection of files that will make it easy for them.\nIn subsequent meetings, be up front with your risks and ways to mitigate them, who you need to hire, and the major challenges ahead.\nTry to get two similarly influential investors to balance each other out. All VCs know each other, all VCs talk\u2014and nobody wants to piss off their potential partners. So if one of your investors starts playing games, the other can tell them to cut the crap. Your business may not matter all that much to them in the long run, but typically nobody wants to ruin their reputation among other VCs and especially the LP community.\nFinally, remember that even if you have an incredible meeting\u2014everyone loves the pitch, you love the investors, the room is practically vibrating with good energy\u2014even then the people you met with will have to go back and convince the investment committee to give you money."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"For every VC that process is different, so keep asking the question: What\u2019s the next step to get us to a yes?

The investors worry that if they challenge the CEO, they won\u2019t get to invest in the next funding round or they\u2019ll get a reputation for firing founders and new startups won\u2019t want to work with them.\nTypically companies with inexperienced boards are always running out of money.

","[See also: Chapter 4.2: Are You Ready?: Seed crystals.]"," A seed crystal points out what your board is missing and tells you who to call, or just calls them for you. Our seed crystal for the Nest board was Randy Komisar\u2014he\u2019s the one who first suggested bringing in Bill Campbell. And he\u2019s the one we\u2019d come to if we needed help with recruiting or landing a perfect candidate.\nA chairperson: This isn\u2019t a must, but it can be helpful. A chairperson sets the agenda, leads the meetings, herds the cats. Sometimes the CEO is the chairperson, sometimes another board member is, sometimes there\u2019s no formal chairperson at all. I\u2019ve seen all three versions work. But what worked best for the Nest board was having Randy Komisar as our unofficial chairman. Instead of me having to do all the 1:1s with board members myself, Randy would go talk to each one, pre-negotiate, and come up with the opinion of the group. He also interviewed execs for Nest and helped fill out the executive roster. A chairperson is the CEO\u2019s closest relationship on the board, a mentor and a partner. They help the CEO through issues they have with other board members, or they step in when the business gets hairy and the team gets scared. They\u2019ll attend employee meetings and give them the board\u2019s perspective on how the company is doing\u2014they\u2019ll say, \u201cThe CEO\u2019s not going anywhere, she\u2019s doing a great job.\u201d Or \u201cThe board\u2019s not worried about the recent sales, and you shouldn\u2019t be, either. We can\u2019t wait to invest again.\u201d Or sometimes, \u201cYes this person has left, but the company will be okay. Here\u2019s the plan that the board supports.\u201d\nThe right investors: When you\u2019re picking investors, you\u2019re also picking one or two of them to be board members. So you don\u2019t want investors who think only in numbers and dollar signs and don\u2019t understand the slog and grind of creation. ","[See also: Chapter 4.3: Marrying for Money.]"," Find investors who are experienced in the work you do and empathetic to how difficult it is to get right. Find human beings who you\u2019d love to have dinner with. If you have an interesting enough company, you can talk to your investors in advance and select the person the firm will put on your board. Sometimes CEOs don\u2019t take the top-dollar investment deal, to ensure that they get a better board member.\nOperators: These are people who have been in your position before and know the roller coaster of company building. When the investor board members start hammering you for not hitting your numbers, the operator board members can step in and explain the realities of the situation. They can talk about how nothing ever goes according to plan. Then they can help you forge a new plan with new techniques and new tools.\nExpertise: Sometimes you\u2019ll need someone who deeply understands something very specific\u2014patents, B2B sales, aluminum manufacturing, whatever\u2014but they\u2019re too experienced or too entrenched in their current project to take a job at your company. So the only way to get them is through a spot on your board. When Apple was thinking about getting into retail for the first time, neither Steve Jobs nor anybody else on the board knew how to do it. So they brought on Mickey Drexler, the CEO of GAP. Mickey\u2019s the one who told them to get an airplane hangar and fully prototype a few different store designs, then walk through them in person like a real customer would before deciding which to take to the public.

I should have remembered that. Larry, with Bill Campbell\u2019s prodding, wanted Nest to come in and shift Google\u2019s entire way of thinking, to give it a burst of startup mojo. But culture doesn\u2019t work that way\u2014you can\u2019t repaint an old factory and show the workers a training video and think you\u2019ve made any kind of difference. You have to tear the whole thing down and rebuild it again."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"Most people and companies need a near-death experience before they can really change."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"You can\u2019t assume acquisition will mean acculturation. That\u2019s why Apple doesn\u2019t really buy companies with large teams. They only acquire specific teams or technologies, usually very early in their life cycle when they\u2019re pre-revenue. That way they can easily be absorbed and Apple never has to worry about culture. They can also skip the inevitable duplication of functions between existing teams like finance, legal, and sales, or the painful process of integrating one large team into another. With the notable exception of the Beats acquisition, Apple has been laser focused on filling small, specialized technology gaps in their evolving products rather than acquiring whole new lines of business."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"All acquisitions come down to what you\u2019re trying to do when you\u2019re buying a company\u2014do you want to buy a team? Technology? Patents? Product? Customer base? Business (that is, revenue)? A brand? Some other strategic assets?"),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"When you\u2019re selling, the same questions apply. What are you looking for? Some hope to use a larger company\u2019s resources to accelerate their vision. Others are looking for financial gain. Then there are the companies who are having problems and are trying to sell off the business to someone who believes in it. Bill Campbell liked to say, \u201cGreat companies are bought, not sold.\u201d If you\u2019re being acquired, you want the buyer to be desperate to buy rather than you being a seller desperate to sell. If you\u2019re considering an acquisition, you want to be wary of anyone throwing themselves at you, pitching you too hard."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"However, there\u2019s no manual for a good acquisition. There are a million things to watch out for, but they change with every company, every deal. Just don\u2019t ignore the hard stuff simply because it\u2019s hard. Don\u2019t forget to talk about culture just because nobody quite knows how to talk about culture."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"Unfortunately, you can\u2019t truly know a culture until you\u2019re in it. It\u2019s like dating\u2014when two people are interested in each other, they put their best foot forward, keep up appearances. Things get much more real when they move in together and get married. That\u2019s when you learn your wife leaves dishes in the sink to \u201csoak\u201d for a few days. It\u2019s when you realize your husband always forgets to clean up his toenail trimmings."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"So the dating phase of any potential acquisition is crucial. You have to check the sink for dirty dishes. You have to spot the toenail on the dining table. Look at the reporting structure and the way they hire and fire employees. Dig into what perks everyone gets. Talk about management philosophy. Make concrete plans for exactly what\u2019s going to happen post-sale. Are you going to integrate or keep your cultures separate? What will you do about overlap? Where will this team go? Who will work on this product?"),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"But always know that you won\u2019t be able to predict the future.
