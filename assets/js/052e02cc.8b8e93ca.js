O\u2019Haire joined one of my classes.\nHe had had little education, and how he loved a scrap!\nHe had once been a chauffeur, and he came to me because\nhe had been trying, without much success, to sell\ntrucks. A little questioning brought out the fact that he\nwas continually scrapping with and antagonizing the\nvery people he was trying to do business with, If a prospect\nsaid anything derogatory about the trucks he was\nselling, Pat saw red and was right at the customer\u2019s\nthroat. Pat won a lot of arguments in those days. As he\nsaid to me afterward, "I often walked out of an office\nsaving: \u2018I told that bird something.\u2019 Sure I had told him\nsomething, but I hadn\u2019t sold him anything.\u201d\nMv first problem was not to teach Patrick J. O\u2019Haire to\ntalk. My immediate task was to train him to refrain from\ntalking and to avoid verbal fights.\nMr. O\u2019Haire became one of the star salesmen for the\nWhite Motor Company in New York. How did he do it?\nHere is his story in his own words: \u201cIf I walk into a\nbuyer\u2019s office now and he says: \u2018What? A White truck?\nThey\u2019re no good! I wouldn\u2019t take one if you gave it to\nme. I\u2019m going to buy the Whose-It truck,\u2019 I say, \u2018The\nWhose-It is a good truck. If you buy the Whose-It, you\u2019ll\nnever make a mistake. The Whose-Its are made by a fine\ncompany and sold by good people.\u2019\n\u201cHe is speechless then. There is no room for an argument.\nIf he says the Whose-It is best and I say sure it is,\nhe has to stop. He can\u2019t keep on all afternoon saying,\n\u2018It\u2019s the best\u2019 when I\u2019m agreeing with him. We then get\noff the subject of Whose-It and I begin to talk about the\ngood points of the White truck.\n\u201cThere was a time when a remark like his first one\nwould have made me see scarlet and red and orange. I\nwould start arguing against the Whose-It; and the more\nI argued against it, the more my prospect argued in favor\nof it; and the more he argued, the more he sold himself\non my competitor\u2019s product.\n\u201cAs I look back now I wonder how I was ever able to\nsell anything. I lost years of my life in scrapping and\narguing. I keep my mouth shut now. It pays.\u201d\nAs wise old Ben Franklin used to say:\nIf you argue and rankle and contradict, you may achieve\na victory sometimes; but it will be an empty victory because\nyou will never get your opponent\u2019s good will.\nSo figure it out for yourself. Which would you rather\nhave, an academic, theatrical victory or a person\u2019s good\nwill? You can seldom have both.\nThe Boston Transcript once printed this bit of significant\ndoggerel:\nHere lies the body of William Jay, .\nWho died maintaining his right of way-\nHe was right, dead right, as he sped along,\nBut he\u2019s just as dead as if he were wrong.\nYou may be right, dead right, as you speed along in\nyour argument; but as far as changing another\u2019s mind is\nconcerned, you will probably be just as futile as if you\nwere wrong.\nFrederick S. Parsons, an income tax consultant, had\nbeen disputing and wrangling for an hour with a gover-ment\ntax inspector. An item of nine thousand dollars was\nat stake. Mr. Parsons claimed that this nine thousand\ndollars was in reality a bad debt, that it would never be\ncollected, that it ought not to be taxed. \u201cBad debt, my\neye !" retorted the inspector. \u201cIt must be taxed.\u201d\n\u201cThis inspector was cold, arrogant and stubborn,\u201d Mr.\nParsons said as he told the story to the class. \u201cReason\nwas wasted and so were facts. . . The longer we argued,\nthe more stubborn he became. So I decided to avoid\nargument, change the subject, and give him appreciation.\n"I said, \u2018I suppose this is a very petty matter in comparison\nwith the really important and difficult decisions\nyou\u2019re required to make. I\u2019ve made a study of taxation\nmyself. But I\u2019ve had to get my knowledge from books.\nYou are getting yours from the firing line of experience.\nI sometime wish I had a job like yours. It would teach\nme a lot.\u2019 I meant every word I said.\n\u201cWell.\u201d The inspector straightened up in his chair,\nleaned back, and talked for a long time about his work,\ntelling me of the clever frauds he had uncovered. His\ntone gradually became friendly, and presently he was\ntelling me about his children. As he left, he advised me\nthat he would consider my problem further and give me\nhis decision in a few days.\n\u201cHe called at my office three days later and informed\nme that he had decided to leave the tax return exactly as\nit was filed.\u201d\nThis tax inspector was demonstrating one of the most\ncommon of human frailties. He wanted a feeling of importance; and as long as Mr. Parsons argued with him,\nhe got his feeling of importance by loudly asserting his\nauthority. But as soon as his importance was admitted\nand the argument stopped and he was permitted to expand\nhis ego, he became a sympathetic and kindly\nhuman being.\nBuddha said: \u201cHatred is never ended by hatred but by\nlove," and a misunderstanding is never ended by an argument\nbut by tact, diplomacy, conciliation and a sympathetic\ndesire to see the other person\u2019s viewpoint.\nLincoln once reprimanded a young army officer for\nindulging in a violent controversy with an associate. \u201cNo\nman who is resolved to make the most of himself,\u201d said\nLincoln, "can spare time for personal contention. Still\nless can he afford to take the consequences, including\nthe vitiation of his temper and the loss of self-control.\nYield larger things to which you show no more than\nequal rights; and yield lesser ones though clearly your\nown. Better give your path to a dog than be bitten by\nhim in contesting for the right. Even killing the dog\nwould not cure the bite.\u201d\nIn an article in Bits and Pieces,* some suggestions are\nmade on how to keep a disagreement from becoming an\nargument:\nWelcome the disagreement. Remember the slogan, \u201cWhen\ntwo partners always agree, one of them is not necessary.\u201d If\nthere is some point you haven\u2019t thought about, be thankful\nif it is brought to your attention. Perhaps this disagreement\nis your opportunity to be corrected before you make a serious\nmistake.\nDistrust your first instinctive impression. Our first natural\nreaction in a disagreeable situation is to be defensive. Be\ncareful. Keep calm and watch out for your first reaction. It\nmay be you at your worst, not your best.\nControl your temper. Remember, you can measure the size\nof a person by what makes him or her angry.\nListen first.Give your opponents a chance to talk. Let them\nfinish. Do not resist, defend or debate. This only raises barriers.\nTry to build bridges of understanding. Don\u2019t build\nhigher barriers of misunderstanding.\nLook for areas of agreement.When you have heard your\nopponents out, dwell first on the points and areas on which\nyou agree.\nBe honest, Look for areas where you can admit error and\nsay so. Apologize for your mistakes. It will help disarm your\nopponents and reduce defensiveness.\nPromise to think over your opponents\u2019 ideas and study\nthem carefully. And mean it. Your opponents may be right.\nIt is a lot easier at this stage to agree to think about their\npoints than to move rapidly ahead and find yourself in a\nposition where your opponents can say: \u201cWe tried to tell\nyou, but you wouldn\u2019t listen.\u201d\nThank your opponents sincerely for their interest. Anyone\nwho takes the time to disagree with you is interested in the\nsame things you are. Think of them as people who really\nwant to help you, and you may turn your opponents into\nfriends.\nPostpone action to give both sides time to think through\nthe problem. Suggest that a new meeting be held later that\nday or the next day, when all the facts may be brought to bear. In preparation for this meeting, ask yourself some hard questions:\nCould my opponents be right? Partly right? Is there truth\nor merit in their position or argument? Is my reaction one\nthat will relieve the problem, or will it just relieve any frustration?\nWill my reaction drive my opponents further away\nor draw them closer to me? Will my reaction elevate the\nestimation good people have of me? Will I win or lose?\nWhat price will I have to pay if I win? If I am quiet about it,\nwill the disagreement blow over?

Let me illustrate.\nMr. S---- a young New York attorney, once argued\na rather important case before the United States\nSupreme Court (Lustgarten v. Fleet Corporation 280\nU.S. 320). The case involved a considerable sum of\nmoney and an important question of law.

I made the\nenormous blunder of telling a very learned and famous\nman that he was wrong.\u201d\nFew people are logical. Most of us are prejudiced and\nbiased. Most of us are blighted with preconceived notions,\nwith jealousy, suspicion, fear, envy and pride.

So, if you are inclined to tell people\nthey are wrong, please read the following paragraph\nevery morning before breakfast. It is from James Harvey\nRobinson\u2019s enlightening book The Mind in the Making.\nWe sometimes find ourselves changing our minds without\nany resistance or heavy emotion, but if we are told we\nare wrong, we resent the imputation and harden our hearts.\nWe are incredibly heedless in the formation of our beliefs,\nbut find ourselves filled with an illicit passion for them\nwhen anyone proposes to rob us of their companionship. It\nis obviously not the ideas themselves that are dear to us,\nbut our self-esteem which is threatened. . . . The little word\n\u201cmy\u201d is the most important one in human affairs, and properly\nto reckon with it is the beginning of wisdom. It has the\nsame force whether it is \u201cmy\u201d dinner, \u201cmy\u201d dog, and "my"\nhouse, or \u201cmy\u201d father, \u201cmy\u201d country, and \u201cmy\u201d God. We\nnot only resent the imputation that our watch is wrong, or\nour car shabby, but that our conception of the canals of\nMars, of the pronunciation of \u201cEpictetus,\u201d of the medicinal\nvalue of salicin, or of the date of Sargon I is subject to revision.\nWe like to continue to believe what we have been\naccustomed to accept as true, and the resentment aroused\nwhen doubt is cast upon any of our assumptions leads us to\nseek every manner of excuse for clinging to it. The result is\nthat most of our so-called reasoning consists in finding arguments\nfor going on believing as we already do.\nCarl Rogers, the eminent psychologist, wrote in his\nbook On Becoming a Person:\nI have found it of enormous value when I can permit\nmyself to understand the other person. The way in which I\nhave worded this statement may seem strange to you, Is it\nnecessary to permit oneself to understand another? I think\nit is. Our first reaction to most of the statements (which we\nhear from other people) is an evaluation or judgment, rather\nthan an understanding of it. When someone expresses some\nfeeling, attitude or belief, our tendency is almost immediately\nto feel \u201cthat\u2019s right,\u201d or \u201cthat\u2019s stupid,\u201d \u201cthat\u2019s abnormal,\u201d\n\u201cthat\u2019s unreasonable,\u201d \u201cthat\u2019s incorrect,\u201d \u201cthat\u2019s not\nnice ."

So,\nbeing human, I tried to defend myself.

My reaction was totally different. \u201cWell, to\ntell the truth,\u201d I said, "I can\u2019t afford them myself. I paid\ntoo much.

He believed that he could drive\nLincoln into agreeing with him by a campaign of argument,\nridicule and abuse. He waged this bitter campaign\nmonth after month, year after year. In fact, he wrote a\nbrutal, bitter, sarcastic and personal attack on President\nLincoln the night Booth shot him.\nBut did all this bitterness make Lincoln agree with\nGreeley? Not at all. Ridicule and abuse never do.\nIf you want some excellent suggestions about dealing\nwith people and managing yourself and improving your\npersonality, read Benjamin Franklin\u2019s autobiography -\none of the most fascinating life stories ever written, one\nof the classics of American literature. Ben Franklin tells\nhow he conquered the iniquitous habit of argument and\ntransformed himself into one of the most able, suave and\ndiplomatic men in American history.\nOne day, when Ben Franklin was a blundering youth,\nan old Quaker friend took him aside and lashed him with\na few stinging truths, something like this:\nBen, you are impossible. Your opinions have a slap in\nthem for everyone who differs with you. They have become\nso offensive that nobody cares for them. Your friends find\nthey enjoy themselves better when you are not around. You\nknow so much that no man can tell you anything. Indeed,\nno man is going to try, for the effort would lead only to\ndiscomfort and hard work. So you are not likely ever to\nknow any more than you do now, which is very little.\nOne of the finest things I know about Ben Franklin is\nthe way he accepted that smarting rebuke. He was big\nenough and wise enough to realize that it was true, to\nsense that he was headed for failure and social disaster.\nSo he made a right-about-face. He began immediately to\nchange his insolent, opinionated ways.\n"I made it a rule,\u201d said Franklin, \u201cto forbear all direct\ncontradiction to the sentiment of others, and all positive\nassertion of my own, I even forbade myself the use of\nevery word or expression in the language that imported\na fix\u2019d opinion, such as \u2018certainly,\u2019 \u2018undoubtedly,\u2019 etc.,\nand I adopted, instead of them, \u2018I conceive,\u2019 \u2018I apprehend,\n\u2019 or \u2018I imagine\u2019 a thing to be so or so, or \u2018it so\nappears to me at present.\u2019 When another asserted something\nthat I thought an error, I deny\u2019d myself the pleasure\nof contradicting him abruptly, and of showing\nimmediately some absurdity in his proposition: and in\nanswering I began by observing that in certain cases or\ncircumstances his opinion would be right, but in the\npresent case there appear\u2019d or seem\u2019d to me some difference,\netc. I soon found the advantage of this change in\nmy manner; the conversations I engag\u2019d in went on more\npleasantly. The modest way in which I propos\u2019d my\nopinions procur\'d them a readier reception and less contradiction;\nI had less mortification when I was found to\nbe in the wrong, and I more easily prevaile\'d with others\nto give up their mistakes and join with me when I happened\nto be in the right.\n\u201cAnd this mode, which I at first put on with some\nviolence to natural inclination, became at length so easy,\nand so habitual to me, that perhaps for these fifty years\npast no one has ever heard a dogmatical expression escape\nme. And to this habit (after my character of integrity)\nI think it principally owing that I had earned so\nmuch weight with my fellow citizens when I proposed\nnew institutions, or alterations in the old, and so much\ninfluence in public councils when I became a member;\nfor I was but a bad speaker, never eloquent, subject to\nmuch hesitation in my choice of words, hardly correct in\nlanguage, and yet I generally carried my points.\u201d\nHow do Ben Franklin\u2019s methods work in business?\nLet\u2019s take two examples.\nKatherine A, Allred of Kings Mountain, North Carolina,\nis an industrial engineering supervisor for a yarn-processing\nplant.

The system we were using had\nworked fine when we had only two or three different\ntypes of yarn, but recently we had expanded our inventory\nand capabilities to enable us to run more than\ntwelve different varieties. The present system was no\nlonger adequate to pay the operators fairly for the work\nbeing performed and give them an incentive to increase\nproduction. I had worked up a new system which would\nenable us to pay the operator by the class of yam she\nwas running at any one particular time. With my new\nsystem in hand, I entered the meeting determined to\nprove to the management that my system was the right\napproach. I told them in detail how they were wrong\nand showed where they were being unfair and how I\nhad all the answers they needed. To say the least, I\nfailed miserably! I had become so busy defending my\nposition on the new system that I had left them no opening\nto graciously admit their problems on the old one.\nThe issue was dead.\n\u201cAfter several sessions of this course, I realized all too\nwell where I had made my mistakes. I called another\nmeeting and this time I asked where they felt their problems\nwere. We discussed each point, and I asked them\ntheir opinions on which was the best way to proceed.\nWith a few low-keyed suggestions, at proper intervals, I\nlet them develop my system themselves. At the end of\nthe meeting when I actually presented my system, they\nenthusiastically accepted it.\n"I am convinced now that nothing good is accomplished\nand a lot of damage can be done if you tell a\nperson straight out that he or she is wrong. You only\nsucceed in stripping that person of self-dignity and making\nyourself an unwelcome part of any discussion.\u201d\nLet\u2019s take another example - and remember these\ncases I am citing are typical of the experiences of thousands\nof other people. R. V. Crowley was a salesman for\na lumber company in New York. Crowley admitted that\nhe had been telling hard-boiled lumber inspectors for\nyears that they were wrong. And he had won the arguments\ntoo. But it hadn\u2019t done any good. \u201cFor these lumber\ninspectors,\u201d said Mr. Crowley, "are like baseball\numpires. Once they make a decision, they never change\nit,\u201d\nMr. Crowley saw that his firm was losing thousands of\ndollars through the arguments he won. So while taking\nmy course, he resolved to change tactics and abandon\narguments. With what results? Here is the story as he\ntold it to the fellow members of his class:\n\u201cOne morning the phone rang in my office. A hot and\nbothered person at the other end proceeded to inform\nme that a car of lumber we had shipped into his plant\nwas entirely unsatisfactory. His firm had stopped unloading\nand requested that we make immediate arrangements\nto remove the stock from their yard. After about\none-fourth of the car had been unloaded, their lumber\ninspector reported that the lumber was running 55 percent\nbelow grade. Under the circumstances, they refused\nto accept it.\n"I immediately started for his plant and on the way\nturned over in my mind the best way to handle the situation.\nOrdinarily, under such circumstances, I should\nhave quoted grading rules and tried, as a result of my\nown experience and knowledge as a lumber inspector,\nto convince the other inspector that the lumber was actually\nup to grade, and that he was misinterpreting the\nrules in his inspection. However, I thought I would\napply the principles learned in this training.\n\u201cWhen I arrived at the plant, I found the purchasing\nagent and the lumber inspector in a wicked humor, both\nset for an argument and a fight. We walked out to the car\nthat was being unloaded, and I requested that they continue\nto unload so that I could see how things were\ngoing. I asked the inspector to go right ahead and lay out\nthe rejects, as he had been doing, and to put the good\npieces in another pile.\n\u201cAfter watching him for a while it began to dawn on\nme that his inspection actually was much too strict and\nthat he was misinterpreting the rules. This particular\nlumber was white pine, and I knew the inspector was\nthoroughly schooled in hard woods but not a competent,\nexperienced inspector on white pine. White pine happened\nto be my own strong suit, but did I offer any\nobjection to the way he was grading the lumber? None\nwhatever. I kept on watching and gradually began to ask\nquestions as to why certain pieces were not satisfactory.\nI didn\u2019t for one instant insinuate that the inspector was\nwrong. I emphasized that my only reason for asking was\nin order that we could give his firm exactly what they\nwanted in future shipments. wanted in future shipments.\n\u201cBy asking questions in a very friendly, cooperative\nspirit, and insisting continually that they were right in\nlaying out boards not satisfactory to their purpose, I got\nhim warmed up, and the strained relations between us\nbegan to thaw and melt away. An occasional carefully\nput remark on my part gave birth to the idea in his mind\nthat possibly some of these rejected pieces were actually\nwithin the grade that they had bought, and that their\nrequirements demanded a more expensive grade. I was\nvery careful, however, not to let him think I was making\nan issue of this point.\n\u201cGradually his whole attitude changed. He finally admitted\nto me that he was not experienced on white pine\nand began to ask me questions about each piece as it\ncame out of the car, I would explain why such a piece\ncame within the grade specified, but kept on insisting\nthat we did not want him to take it if it was unsuitable\nfor their purpose. He finally got to the point where he\nfelt guilty every time he put a piece in the rejected pile.\nAnd at last he saw that the mistake was on their part for\nnot having specified as good a grade as they needed.\n\u201cThe ultimate outcome was that he went through the\nentire carload again after I left, accepted the whole lot,\nand we received a check in full.\n\u201cIn that one instance alone, a little tact, and the determination\nto refrain from telling the other man he was\nwrong, saved my company a substantial amount of cash,\nand it would be hard to place a money value on the good\nwill that was saved.\u201d\nMartin Luther King was asked how, as a pacifist, he\ncould be an admirer of Air Force General Daniel "Chappie\u201d\nJames, then the nation\u2019s highest-ranking black officer.\nDr. King replied, "I judge people by their own\nprinciples - not by my own.\u201d\nIn a similar way, General Robert E. Lee once spoke to\nthe president of the Confederacy, Jefferson Davis, in the\nmost glowing terms about a certain officer under his\ncommand. Another officer in attendance was astonished.\n\u201cGeneral,\u201d he said, " do you not know that the man of\nwhom you speak so highly is one of your bitterest enemies\nwho misses no opportunity to malign you?\u201d "Yes,"\nreplied General Lee, \u201cbut the president asked my opinion\nof him; he did not ask for his opinion of me.\u201d\nBy the way, I am not revealing anything new in this\nchapter. Two thousand years ago, Jesus said: \u201cAgree\nwith thine adversary quickly.\u201d\nAnd 2,200 years before Christ was born, King Akhtoi\nof Egypt gave his son some shrewd advice - advice that\nis sorely needed today. \u201cBe diplomatic,\u201d counseled the\nKing. \u201cIt will help you gain your point.\u201d\nIn other words, don\u2019t argue with your customer or your\nspouse or your adversary. Don\u2019t tell them they are\nwrong, don\u2019t get them stirred up. Use a little diplomacy.\nPRINCIPLE 2\nShow respect for the other person\u2019s opinions.\nNever say, "You\'re wrong.\u201d\nIF YOU\u2019RE WRONG, ADMIT ITWithin a minute\u2019s walk of my house there was a wild\nstretch of virgin timber, where the blackberry thickets\nfoamed white in the springtime, where the squirrels\nnested and reared their young, and the horseweeds grew\nas tall as a horse\u2019s head. This unspoiled woodland was\ncalled Forest Park - and it was a forest, probably not\nmuch different in appearance from what it was when\nColumbus discovered America. I frequently walked in\nthis park with Rex, my little Boston bulldog. He was a\nfriendly, harmless little hound; and since we rarely met\nanyone in the park, I took Rex along without a leash or a\nmuzzle.\nOne day we encountered a mounted policeman in the\npark, a policeman itching to show his authority.\n\u201c\u2018What do you mean by letting that dog run loose in\nthe park without a muzzle and leash?\u201d he reprimanded\nme. \u201cDon\u2019t you know it\u2019s against the law?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I know it is,\u201d I replied softy, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t think\nhe would do any harm out here.\u201d\n"You didn\u2019t think! You didn\u2019t think! The law doesn\u2019t\ngive a tinker\u2019s damn about what you think. That dog\nmight kill a squirrel or bite a child. Now, I\u2019m going to let\nyou off this time; but if I catch this dog out here again\nwithout a muzzle and a leash, you\u2019ll have to tell it to the\njudge ."\nI meekly promised to obey.\nAnd I did obey - for a few times. But Rex didn\u2019t like\nthe muzzle, and neither did I; so we decided to take a\nchance. Everything was lovely for a while, and then we\nstruck a snag. Rex and I raced over the brow of a hill one\nafternoon and there, suddenly - to my dismay - I saw\nthe majesty of the law, astride a bay horse. Rex was out\nin front, heading straight for the officer.\nI was in for it. I knew it. So I didn\u2019t wait until the\npoliceman started talking. I beat him to it. I said: \u201cOfficer,\nyou\u2019ve caught me red-handed. I\u2019m guilty. I have no\nalibis, no excuses. You warned me last week that if I\nbrought the dog out here again without a muzzle you\nwould fine me.\u201d\n"Well, now,\u201d the policeman responded in a soft tone.\n\u201cI know it\u2019s a temptation to let a little dog like that have\na run out here when nobody is around.\u201d\n\u201cSure it\u2019s a temptation,\u201d I replied, \u201cbut it is against\nthe law.\u201d\n\u201cWell, a little dog like that isn\u2019t going to harm anybody,\u201d\nthe policeman remonstrated.\n"No, but he may kill squirrels,\u201d I said.\n\u201cWell now, I think you are taking this a bit too seriously,\u201d\nhe told me. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what you do. You just\nlet him run over the hill there where I can\u2019t see him - and\nwe\u2019ll forget all about it.\u201d\nThat policeman, being human, wanted a feeling of importance;\nso when I began to condemn myself, the only\nway he could nourish his self-esteem was to take the\nmagnanimous attitude of showing mercy.\nBut suppose I had tried to defend myself - well, did\nyou ever argue with a policeman?\nBut instead of breaking lances with him, I admitted\nthat he was absolutely right and I was absolutely wrong;\nI admitted it quickly, openly, and with enthusiasm. The\naffair terminated graciously in my taking his side and his\ntaking my side. Lord Chesterfield himself could hardly\nhave been more gracious than this mounted policeman,\nwho, only a week previously, had threatened to have the\nlaw on me.\nIf we know we are going to be rebuked anyhow, isn\u2019t\nit far better to beat the other person to it and do it ourselves?\nIsn\u2019t it much easier to listen to self-criticism than\nto bear condemnation from alien lips?\nSay about yourself all the derogatory things you know\nthe other person is thinking or wants to say or intends to\nsay - and say them before that person has a chance to\nsay them. The chances are a hundred to one that a generous,\nforgiving attitude will be taken and your mistakes\nwill be minimized just as the mounted policeman did\nwith me and Rex.\nFerdinand E. Warren, a commercial artist, used this\ntechnique to win the good will of a petulant, scolding\nbuyer of art.\n\u201cIt is important, in making drawings for advertising\nand publishing purposes, to be precise and very exact,\u201d\nMr. Warren said as he told the story.\n\u201cSome art editors demand that their commissions be\nexecuted immediately; and in these cases, some slight\nerror is liable to occur. I knew one art director in particular\nwho was always delighted to find fault with some\nlittle thing. I have often left his office in disgust, not\nbecause of the criticism, but because of his method of\nattack. Recently I delivered a rush job to this editor, and\nhe phoned me to call at his office immediately. He said\nsomething was wrong. When I arrived, I found just what\nI had anticipated - and dreaded. He was hostile, gloating\nover his chance to criticize. He demanded with heat\nwhy I had done so and so. My opportunity had come to\napply the self-criticism I had been studying about. So I\nsaid: \'\'Mr. So-and-so, if what you say is true, I am at fault\nand there is absolutely no excuse for my blunder. I have\nbeen doing drawings for you long enough to know bet-ter.\nI\u2019m ashamed of myself.\u2019\n\u201cImmediately he started to defend me. \u2018Yes, you\u2019re\nright, but after all, this isn\u2019t a serious mistake. It is\nonly -\'\n"I interrupted him. \u2018Any mistake,\u2019 I said, \u2018may be\ncostly and they are all irritating.\u2019\n\u201cHe started to break in, but I wouldn\u2019t let him. I was\nhaving a grand time. For the first time in my life, I was\ncriticizing myself - and I loved it.\n" \u2018I should have been more careful,\u2019 I continued. \u2018You\ngive me a lot of work, and you deserve the best; so I\u2019m\ngoing to do this drawing all over.\u2019\n" \u2018No! No!\u2019 he protested. \u2018I wouldn\u2019t think of putting\nyou to all that trouble.\u2019 He praised my work, assured me\nthat he wanted only a minor change and that my slight\nerror hadn\u2019t cost his firm any money; and, after all, it was\na mere detail - not worth worrying about.\n\u201cMy eagerness to criticize myself took all the fight out\nof him. He ended up by taking me to lunch; and before\nwe parted, he gave me a check and another commission\u201d\nThere is a certain degree of satisfaction in having the\ncourage to admit one\u2019s errors. It not only clears the air of\nguilt and defensiveness, but often helps solve the problem\ncreated by the error.\nBruce Harvey of Albuquerque, New Mexico, had incorrectly\nauthorized payment of full wages to an employee\non sick leave. When he discovered his error, he\nbrought it to the attention of the employee and explained\nthat to correct the mistake he would have to\nreduce his next paycheck by the entire amount of the\noverpayment. The employee pleaded that as that would\ncause him a serious financial problem, could the money\nbe repaid over a period of time? In order to do this,\nHarvey explained, he would have to obtain his supervisor\'s\napproval. \u201cAnd this I knew,\u201d reported Harvey,\n\u201cwould result in a boss-type explosion, While trying to\ndecide how to handle this situation better, I realized that\nthe whole mess was my fault and I would have to admit I\nit to my boss.\n\u201cI walked into his office, told him that I had made a\nmistake and then informed him of the complete facts.\nHe replied in an explosive manner that it was the fault\nof the personnel department. I repeated that it was my\nfault. He exploded again about carelessness in the accounting\ndepartment. Again I explained it was my fault.\nHe blamed two other people in the office. But each time\nI reiterated it was my fault. Finally, he looked at me and\nsaid, \u2018Okay, it was your fault. Now straighten it out.\u2019 The\nerror was corrected and nobody got into trouble. I felt\ngreat because I was able to handle a tense situation and\nhad the courage not to seek alibis. My boss has had more\nrespect for me ever since.\u201d\nAny fool can try to defend his or her mistakes - and\nmost fools do - but it raises one above the herd and gives\none a feeling of nobility and exultation to admit one\u2019s\nmistakes. For example, one of the most beautiful things\nthat history records about Robert E. Lee is the way he\nblamed himself and only himself for the failure of Pickett\u2019s\ncharge at Gettysburg.\nPickett\u2019s charge was undoubtedly the most brilliant\nand picturesque attack that ever occurred in the Western\nworld. General George E. Pickett himself was picturesque.\nHe wore his hair so long that his auburn locks\nalmost touched his shoulders; and, like Napoleon in his\nItalian campaigns, he wrote ardent love-letters almost\ndaily while on the battlefield. His devoted troops\ncheered him that tragic July afternoon as he rode off\njauntily toward the Union lines, his cap set at a rakish\nangle over his right ear. They cheered and they followed\nhim, man touching man, rank pressing rank, with banners\nflying and bayonets gleaming in the sun. It was a\ngallant sight. Daring. Magnificent. A murmur of admiration\nran through the Union lines as they beheld it.\nPickett\u2019s troops swept forward at any easy trot, through\norchard and cornfield, across a meadow and over a ravine.\nAll the time, the enemy\u2019s cannon was tearing\nghastly holes in their ranks, But on they pressed, grim,\nirresistible.\nSuddenly the Union infantry rose from behind the\nstone wall on Cemetery Ridge where they had been hiding\nand fired volley after volley into Pickett\'s onrushing\ntroops. The crest of the hill was a sheet of flame, a\nslaughterhouse, a blazing volcano. In a few minutes, all\nof Pickett\u2019s brigade commanders except one were down,\nand four-fifths of his five thousand men had fallen.\nGeneral Lewis A. Armistead, leading the troops in the\nfinal plunge, ran forward, vaulted over the stone wall,\nand, waving his cap on the top of his sword, shouted:\n\u201cGive \u2018em the steel, boys!\u201d\nThey did. They leaped over the wall, bayoneted their\nenemies, smashed skulls with clubbed muskets, and\nplanted the battleflags of the South on Cemetery Ridge.\nThe banners waved there only for a moment. But that\nmoment, brief as it was, recorded the high-water mark of\nthe Confederacy.\nPickett\u2019s charge - brilliant, heroic - was nevertheless\nthe beginning of the end. Lee had failed. He could not\npenetrate the North. And he knew it.\nThe South was doomed.\nLee was so saddened, so shocked, that he sent in his\nresignation and asked Jefferson Davis, the president of\nthe Confederacy, to appoint "a younger and abler man.\u201d\nIf Lee had wanted to blame the disastrous failure of\nPickett\u2019s charge on someone else, he could have found a\nscore of alibis. Some of his division commanders had\nfailed him. The cavalry hadn\u2019t arrived in time to support\nthe infantry attack. This had gone wrong and that had\ngone awry.\nBut Lee was far too noble to blame others. As Pickett\u2019s\nbeaten and bloody troops struggled back to the Confederate\nlines, Robert E. Lee rode out to meet them all\nalone and greeted them with a self-condemnation that\nwas little short of sublime. \u201cAll this has been my fault,\u201d\nhe confessed. "I and I alone have lost this battle.\u201d\nFew generals in all history have had the courage and\ncharacter to admit that.\nMichael Cheung, who teaches our course in Hong\nKong, told of how the Chinese culture presents some\nspecial problems and how sometimes it is necessary to\nrecognize that the benefit of applying a principle may be\nmore advantageous than maintaining an old tradition.\nHe had one middle-aged class member who had been\nestranged from his son for many years. The father had\nbeen an opium addict, but was now cured. In Chinese\ntradition an older person cannot take the first step. The\nfather felt that it was up to his son to take the initiative\ntoward a reconciliation. In an early session, he told the\nclass about the grandchildren he had never seen and\nhow much he desired to be reunited with his son. His\nclassmates, all Chinese, understood his conflict between\nhis desire and long-established tradition. The father felt\nthat young people should have respect for their elders\nand that he was right in not giving in to his desire, but to\nwait for his son to come to him.\nToward the end of the course the father again addressed\nhis class. \u201cI have pondered this problem,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cDale Carnegie says, \u2018If you are wrong, admit it\nquickly and emphatically.\u2019 It is too late for me to admit\nit quickly, but I can admit it emphatically. I wronged my\nson. He was right in not wanting to see me and to expel\nme from his life. I may lose face by asking a younger\nperson\u2019s forgiveness, but I was at fault and it is my responsibility\nto admit this.\u201d The class applauded and\ngave him their full support. At the next class he told how\nhe went to his son\u2019s house, asked for and received forgiveness\nand was now embarked on a new relationship\nwith his son, his daughter-in-law and the grandchildren\nhe had at last met.\nElbert Hubbard was one of the most original authors\nwho ever stirred up a nation, and his stinging sentences\noften aroused fierce resentment. But Hubbard with his\nrare skill for handling people frequently turned his enemies\ninto friends.\nFor example, when some irritated reader wrote in to\nsay that he didn\u2019t agree with such and such an article\nand ended by calling Hubbard this and that, Elbert Hubbard\nwould answer like this:\nCome to think it over, I don\u2019t entirely agree with it myself.\nNot everything I wrote yesterday appeals to me today. I am\nglad to learn what you think on the subject. The next time\nyou are in the neighborhood you must visit us and we\u2019ll get\nthis subject threshed out for all time. So here is a handclasp\nover the miles, and I am,\nYour sincerely,\nWhat could you say to a man who treated you like\nthat?\nWhen we are right, let\u2019s try to win people gently and\ntactfully to our way of thinking, and when we are wrong')),(0,o.kt)("ul",null,(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},'and that will be surprisingly often, if we are honest\nwith ourselves - let\u2019s admit our mistakes quickly and\nwith enthusiasm. Not only will that technique produce\nastonishing results; but, believe it or not, it is a lot more\nfun, under the circumstances, than trying to defend oneself.\nRemember the old proverb: "By fighting you never\nget enough, but by yielding you get more than you expected.\u201d\nPRINCIPLE 3\nIf you are wrong, admit it quickly and\nemphatically.\nA DROP OF HONEY\nIf your temper is aroused and you tell \u2018em a thing or two,\nyou will have a fine time unloading your feelings. But\nwhat about the other person? Will he share your pleasure?\nWill your belligerent tones, your hostile attitude,\nmake it easy for him to agree with you?\n\u201cIf you come at me with your fists doubled,\u201d said\nWoodrow Wilson, \u201cI think I can promise you that mine\nwill double as fast as yours; but if you come to me and\nsay, \u2018Let us sit down and take counsel together, and, if\nwe differ from each other, understand why it is that we\ndiffer, just what the points at issue are,\u2019 we will presently\nfind that we are not so far apart after all, that the\npoints on which we differ are few and the points on\nwhich we agree are many, and that if we only have the\npatience and the candor and the desire to get together,\nwe will get together.\u201d\nNobody appreciated the truth of Woodrow Wilson\u2019s\nstatement more than John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Back in\n1915, Rockefeller was the most fiercely despised man in\nColorado, One of the bloodiest strikes in the history of\nAmerican industry had been shocking the state for two\nterrible years. Irate, belligerent miners were demanding\nhigher wages from the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company;\nRockefeller controlled that company. Property had\nbeen destroyed, troops had been called out. Blood had\nbeen shed. Strikers had been shot, their bodies riddled\nwith bullets.\nAt a time like that, with the air seething with hatred,\nRockefeller wanted to win the strikers to his way of\nthinking. And he did it. How? Here\u2019s the story. After\nweeks spent in making friends, Rockefeller addressed\nthe representatives of the strikers. This speech, in its\nentirety, is a masterpiece. It produced astonishing results.\nIt calmed the tempestuous waves of hate that\nthreatened to engulf Rockefeller. It won him a host of\nadmirers. It presented facts in such a friendly manner\nthat the strikers went back to work without saying another\nword about the increase in wages for which they\nhad fought so violently.\nThe opening of that remarkable speech follows. Note\nhow it fairly glows with friendliness. Rockefeller, remember,\nwas talking to men who, a few days previously,\nhad wanted to hang him by the neck to a sour apple tree;\nyet he couldn\u2019t have been more gracious, more friendly\nif he had addressed a group of medical missionaries. His\nspeech was radiant with such phrases as I am proud to\nbe here, having visited in your homes, met many of your\nwives and children, we meet here not as strangers, but\nas friends . . . spirit of mutual friendship, our common\ninterests, it is only by your courtesy that I am here.\n\u201cThis is a red-letter day in my life,\u201d Rockefeller\nbegan. \u201cIt is the first time I have ever had the good\nfortune to meet the representatives of the employees of\nthis great company, its officers and superintendents, together,\nand I can assure you that I am proud to be here,\nand that I shall remember this gathering as long as I live.\nHad this meeting been held two weeks ago, I should\nhave stood here a stranger to most of you, recognizing a\nfew faces. Having had the opportunity last week of\nvisiting all the camps in the southern coal field and\nof talking individually with practically all of the\nrepresentatives, except those who were away; having\nvisited in your homes, met many of your wives and children,\nwe meet here not as strangers, but as friends, and\nit is in that spirit of mutual friendship that I am glad to\nhave this opportunity to discuss with you our common\ninterests.\n\u201cSince this is a meeting of the officers of the company\nand the representatives of the employees, it is only by\nyour courtesy that I am here, for I am not so fortunate as\nto be either one or the other; and yet I feel that I am\nintimately associated with you men, for, in a sense, I\nrepresent both the stockholders and the directors.\u201d\nIsn\u2019t that a superb example of the fine art of making\nfriends out of enemies?\nSuppose Rockefeller had taken a different tack. Suppose\nhe had argued with those miners and hurled devastating\nfacts in their faces. Suppose he had told them by\nhis tones and insinuations that they were wrong Suppose\nthat, by all the rules of logic, he had proved that\nthey were wrong. What would have happened? More\nanger would have been stirred up, more hatred, more\nrevolt.\nIf a man\'s heart is rankling with discord and ill feeling\ntoward you, you can\u2019t win him to your way of thinking\nwith all the logic in Christendom. Scolding parents\nand domineering bosses and husbands and nagging\nwives ought to realize that people don\u2019t want to change\ntheir minds. They can\u2019t he forced or driven to agree\nwith you or me. But they may possibly be led to, if we\nare gentle and friendly, ever so gentle and ever so\nfriendly.\nLincoln said that, in effect, over a hundred years ago.\nHere are his words:\nIt is an old and true maxim that "a drop of honey catches\nmore flies than a gallon of gall." So with men, if you would\nwin a man to you cause, first convince him that you are his\nsincere friend. Therein is a drop of honey that catches his\nheart; which, say what you will, is the great high road to\nhis reason.\nBusiness executives have learned that it pays to be\nfriendly to strikers. For example, when 2,500 employees\nin the White Motor Company\u2019s plant struck for higher\nwages and a union shop, Robert F. Black, then president\nof the company, didn\u2019t lose his temper and condemn and\nthreaten and talk of tryanny and Communists. He actually\npraised the strikers. He published an advertisement\nin the Cleveland papers, complimenting them on\n\u201cthe peaceful way in which they laid down their tools.\u201d\nFinding the strike pickets idle, he bought them a couple\nof dozen baseball bats and gloves and invited them to\nplay ball on vacant lots. For those who preferred bowling,\nhe rented a bowling alley.\nThis friendliness on Mr. Black\u2019s part did what friendliness\nalways does: it begot friendliness. So the strikers\nborrowed brooms, shovels, and rubbish carts, and began\npicking up matches, papers, cigarette stubs, and cigar\nbutts around the factory. Imagine it! Imagine strikers\ntidying up the factory grounds while battling for higher\nwages and recognition of the union.

I wanted to stay if I could get my rent reduced.\nBut the situation seemed hopeless. Other tenants had\ntried - and failed. Everyone told me that the landlord\nwas extremely difficult to deal with.

Everybody in the organization was interested in\nseeing if and how they could handle it. Mr. Woodcock,\nseveral of his subordinate managers, and members of\nother departments of the utility went to see the operation.\nMany cars and trucks were there, and a number of\npeople were standing around watching the two lone\nmen on top of the pole.\nGlancing around, Woodcock noticed a man up the\nstreet getting out of his car with a camera. He began\ntaking pictures of the scene. Utility people are extremely\nconscious of public relations, and suddenly Woodcock\nrealized what this setup looked like to the man with the\ncamera - overkill, dozens of people being called out to\ndo a two-person job.

The water forced\nitself under the concrete basement floor, causing it to\nexplode, and the basement filled with water. This ruined\nthe furnace and the hot-water heater. The cost to repair\nthis damage was in excess of two thousand dollars. I had\nno insurance to cover this type of damage.\n\u201cHowever, I soon found out that the owner of the subdivision\nhad neglected to put in a storm drain near the\nhouse which could have prevented this problem I made\nan appointment to see him. During the twenty-five-mile\ntrip to his office, I carefully reviewed the situation and,\nremembering the principles I learned in this course, I\ndecided that showing my anger would not serve any\nworthwhile purpose, When I arrived, I kept very calm\nand started by talking about his recent vacation to the\nWest Indies; then, when I felt the timing was right, I\nmentioned the \u2018little\u2019 problem of water damage. He\nquickly agreed to do his share in helping to correct the\nproblem.\n\u201cA few days later he called and said he would pay for\nthe damage and also put in a storm drain to prevent the\nsame thing from happening in the future.\n\u201cEven though it was the fault of the owner of the subdivision,\nif I had not begun in a friendly way, there\nwould have been a great deal of difficulty in getting him\nto agree to the total liability.\u201d\nYears ago, when I was a barefoot boy walking through\nthe woods to a country school out in northwest Missouri,\nI read a fable about the sun and the wind. They quarreled\nabout which was the stronger, and the wind said,\n"I\'ll prove I am. See the old man down there with a\ncoat? I bet I can get his coat off him quicker than you\ncan.\u201d\nSo the sun went behind a cloud, and the wind blew\nuntil it was almost a tornado, but the harder it blew, the\ntighter the old man clutched his coat to him.\nFinally, the wind calmed down and gave up, and then\nthe sun came out from behind the clouds and smiled\nkindly on the old man. Presently, he mopped his brow\nand pulled off his coat. The sun then told the wind that\ngentleness and friendliness were always stronger than\nfury and force.\nThe use of gentleness and friendliness is demonstrated\nday after day by people who have learned that a\ndrop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.\nF. Gale Connor of Lutherville, Maryland, proved this\nwhen he had to take his four-month-old car to the service\ndepartment of the car dealer for the third time.

After a short wait, I was ushered\ninto Mr. White\u2019s office. I introduced myself and\nexplained to him that I had bought my car from his\ndealership because of the recommendations of friends\nwho had had previous dealings with him. I was told that\nhis prices were very competitive and his service was\noutstanding. He smiled with satisfaction as he listened\nto me. I then explained the problem I was having with\nthe service department. \u2018I thought you might want to be\naware of any situation that might tarnish your fine reputation,\u2019\nI added. He thanked me for calling this to his\nattention and assured me that my problem would be\ntaken care of. Not only did he personal get involved,\nbut he also lent me his car to use while mine was being\nrepaired.\u201d\nAesop was a Greek slave who lived at the court of\nCroesus and spun immortal fables six hundred years before\nChrist.

Begin by emphasizing - and\nkeep on emphasizing - the things on which you agree.\nKeep emphasizing, if possible, that you are both striving\nfor the same end and that your only difference is one of\nmethod and not of purpose.\nGet the other person saying \u201cYes, yes\u201d at the outset.\nKeep your opponent, if possible, from saying \u201cNo.\u201d\nA \u201cNo\u201d response, according to Professor Overstreet,*\nis a most difficult handicap to overcome. When you have\nsaid \u201cNo,\u201d all your pride of personality demands that\nyou remain consistent with yourself. You may later feel\nthat the \u201cNo\u201d was ill-advised; nevertheless, there is your\nprecious pride to consider! Once having said a thing,\nyou feel you must stick to it. Hence it is of the very\ngreatest importance that a person be started in the affirmative\ndirection.')),(0,o.kt)("ul",null,(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},'Harry A. Overstreet, lnfluencing Humun Behavior (New York: Norton,\n1925).\nThe skillful speaker gets, at the outset, a number of\n\u201cYes\u201d responses. This sets the psychological process of\nthe listeners moving in the affirmative direction. It is\nlike the movement of a billiard ball. Propel in one direction,\nand it takes some force to deflect it; far more force\nto send it back in the opposite direction.\nThe psychological patterns here are quite clear. When\na person says \u201cNo\u201d and really means it, he or she is\ndoing far more than saying a word of two letters. The\nentire organism - glandular, nervous, muscular -\ngathers itself together into a condition of rejection. There is,\nusually in minute but sometimes in observable degree,\na physical withdrawal or readiness for withdrawal. The\nwhole neuromuscular system, in short, sets itself on\nguard against acceptance. When, to the contrary, a person\nsays \u201cYes,\u201d none of the withdrawal activities takes\nplace. The organism is in a forward - moving, accepting,\nopen attitude. Hence the more \u201cYeses\u201d we can, at the\nvery outset, induce, the more likely we are to succeed in\ncapturing the attention for our ultimate proposal.\nIt is a very simple technique - this yes response. And\nyet, how much it is neglected! It often seems as if people\nget a sense of their own importance by antagonizing others\nat the outset.\nGet a student to say \u201cNo\u201d at the beginning, or a customer,\nchild, husband, or wife, and it takes the wisdom\nand the patience of angels to transform that bristling\nnegative into an affirmative.\nThe use of this \u201cyes, yes\u201d technique enabled James\nEberson, who was a teller in the Greenwich Savings\nBank, in New York City, to secure a prospective customer\nwho might otherwise have been lost.\n\u201cThis man came in to open an account,\u201d said Mr.\nEberson, \u201cand I gave him our usual form to fill out. Some\nof the questions he answered willingly, but there were\nothers he flatly refused to answer.\n\u201cBefore I began the study of human relations, I would\nhave told this prospective depositor that if he refused to\ngive the bank this information, we should have to refuse\nto accept this account. I am ashamed that I have been\nguilty of doing that very thing in the past. Naturally, an\nultimatum like that made me feel good. I had shown\nwho was boss, that the bank\u2019s rules and regulations\ncouldn\u2019t be flouted. But that sort of attitude certainly\ndidn\u2019t give a feeling of welcome and importance to the\nman who had walked in to give us his patronage.\n\u201cI resolved this morning to use a little horse sense. I\nresolved not to talk about what the bank wanted but\nabout what the customer wanted. And above all else, I\nwas determined to get him saying \u2018yes, yes\u2019 from the\nvery start. So I agreed with him. I told him the information\nhe refused to give was not absolutely necessary.\n" \u2018However,\u2019 I said, \u2018suppose you have money in this\nbank at your death. Wouldn\u2019t you like to have the bank\ntransfer it to your next of kin, who is entitled to it according\nto law?\u2019\n" \u2018Yes, of course,\u2019 he replied.\n" \u2018Don\u2019t you think,\u2019 I continued, \u2018that it would be a\ngood idea to give us the name of your next of kin so that,\nin the event of your death, we could carry out your\nwishes without error or delay?\u2019\n\u201cAgain he said, \u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u201cThe young man\u2019s attitude softened and changed\nwhen he realized that we weren\u2019t asking for this information\nfor our sake but for his sake. Before leaving the\nbank, this young man not only gave me complete information\nabout himself but he opened, at my suggestion,\na trust account, naming his mother as the beneficiary for\nhis account, and he had gladly answered all the questions\nconcerning his mother also.\n"I found that by getting him to say \u2018yes, yes\u2019 from the\noutset, he forgot the issue at stake and was happy to do\nall the things I suggested.\u201d\nJoseph Allison, a sales representative for Westinghouse\nElectric Company, had this story to tell: \u201cThere\nwas a man in my territory that our company was most\neager to sell to. My predecessor had called on him for\nten years without selling anything When I took over the\nterritory, I called steadily for three years without getting\nan order. Finally, after thirteen years of calls and sales\ntalk, we sold him a few motors. If these proved to be all\nright, an order for several hundred more would follow.\nSuch was my expectation,\n\u201cRight? I knew they would be all right. So when I\ncalled three weeks later, I was in high spirits.\n\u201cThe chief engineer greeted me with this shocking\nannouncement: \u2018Allison, I can\u2019t buy the remainder of the\nmotors from you.\u2019\n" \u2018Why?\u2019 I asked in amazement. \u2018Why?\u2019\n" \u2018Because your motors are too hot. I can\u2019t put my hand\non them,\u2019\n"I knew it wouldn\u2019t do any good to argue. I had tried\nthat sort of thing too long. So I thought of getting the\n\'yes, yes\' response.\n" \u2018Well, now look, Mr. Smith,\u2019 I said. \u2018I agree with you\na hundred percent; if those motors are running too hot,\nyou ought not to buy any more of them. You must have\nmotors that won\u2019t run any hotter than standards set by\nthe National Electrical Manufacturers Association. Isn\u2019t\nthat so?\u2019\n\u201cHe agreed it was. I had gotten my first \u2018yes.\u2019\n" \u2018The Electrical Manufacturers Association regulations\nsay that a properly designed motor may have a\ntemperature of 72 degrees Fahrenheit above room temperature.\nIs that correct?\u2019\n" \u2018Yes,\u2019 he agreed. \u2018That\u2019s quite correct. But your motors\nare much hotter.\u2019\n"I didn\u2019t argue with him. I merely asked: \u2018How hot is\nthe mill room?\u2019\n" \u2018Oh,\u2019 he said, \u2018about 75 degrees Fahrenheit.\u2019\n" \u2018Well,\u2019 I replied, \u2018if the mill room is 75 degrees and\nyou add 72 to that, that makes a total of 147 degrees\nFahrenheit. Wouldn\u2019t you scald your hand if you held it\nunder a spigot of hot water at a temperature of 147 degrees\nFahrenheit?\u2019\n\u201cAgain he had to say \u2018yes.\u2019\n" \u2018Well,\u2019 I suggested, \u2018wouldn\u2019t it he a good idea to\nkeep your hands off those motors?\u2019\n" \u2018Well, I guess you\u2019re right,\u2019 he admitted. We continued\nto chat for a while. Then he called his secretary and\nlined up approximately $35,000 worth of business for\nthe ensuing month.\n\u201cIt took me years and cost me countless thousands of\ndollars in lost business before I finally learned that it\ndoesn\u2019t pay to argue, that it is much more profitable and\nmuch more interesting to look at things from the other\nperson\u2019s viewpoint and try to get that person saying \u2018yes, yes.\' "\nEddie Snow, who sponsors our courses in Oakland,\nCalifornia, tells how he became a good customer of a\nshop because the proprietor got him to say \u201cyes, yes.\u201d\nEddie had become interested in bow hunting and had\nspent considerable money in purchasing equipment and\nsupplies from a local bow store.

I could buy a complete set\nfor only $4.95 more than I could rent one. He explained\nthat is why they had discontinued renting them. Did I\nthink that was reasonable?

Three important manufacturers\nhad worked up fabrics in sample bodies. These had all\nbeen inspected by the executives of the motor company,\nand notice had been sent to each manufacturer saying\nthat, on a certain day, a representative from each supplier\nwould be given an opportunity to make a final plea\nfor the contract.\nG.B.R., a representative of one manufacturer, arrived\nin town with a severe attack of laryngitis. \u201cWhen it came\nmy turn to meet the executives in conference,\u201d Mr.\nR---- said as he related the story before one of my\nclasses, \u201cI had lost my voice. I could hardly whisper. I\nwas ushered into a room and found myself face to face\nwith the textile engineer, the purchasing agent, the director\nof sales and the president of the company. I stood\nup and made a valiant effort to speak, but I couldn\u2019t do\nanything more than squeak.\n\u201cThey were all seated around a table, so I wrote on a\npad of paper: \u2018Gentlemen, I have lost my voice.

And the president, since he was talking for me,\ntook the position I would have had during the discussion\nMy sole participation consisted of smiles, nods and\na few gestures.\n\u201cAs a result of this unique conference, I was awarded\nthe contract, which called for over half a million yards of\nupholstery fabrics at an aggregate value of $1,600,000 -\nthe biggest order I had ever received.\n"I know I would have lost the contract if I hadn\u2019t lost\nmy voice, because I had the wrong idea about the whole\nproposition.

I had\nnever listened to her. I was always telling her to do this\nor that. When she wanted to tell me her thoughts, feelings,\nideas, I interrupted with more orders. I began to\nrealize that she needed me - not as a bossy mother, but\nas a confidante, an outlet for all her confusion about\ngrowing up. And all I had been doing was talking when\nI should have been listening. I never heard her.\n\u201cFrom that time on I let her do all the talking she\nwanted.

We\ndon\u2019t even provide leads for prospects, as we cannot advertise\nfor them as our larger competitors do.\n\u201cRichard Pryor had the type of experience we wanted\nfor this position, and he was interviewed first by my\nassistant, who told him about all the negatives related to\nthis job. He seemed slightly discouraged when he came\ninto my office. I mentioned the one benefit of being associated\nwith my firm, that of being an independent contractor\nand therefore virtually being self-employed.\n\u201cAs he talked about these advantages to me, he talked\nhimself out of each negative thought he had when he\ncame in for the interview. Several times it seemed as\nthough he was half talking to himself as he was thinking\nthrough each thought. At times I was tempted to add to\nhis thoughts; however, as the interview came to a close\nI felt he had convinced himself, very much on his own,\nthat he would like to work for my firm.\n\u201cBecause I had been a good listener and let Dick do\nmost of the talking, he was able to weigh both sides\nfairly in his mind, and he came to the positive conclusion,\nwhich was a challenge he created for himself. We\nhired him and he has been an outstanding representative\nfor our firm,\u201d\nEven our friends would much rather talk to us about\ntheir achievements than listen to us boast about ours.\nLa Rochefoucauld, the French philosopher, said: \u201cIf\nyou want enemies, excel your friends; but if you want\nfriends, let your friends excel you.\u201d\nWhy is that true? Because when our friends excel us,\nthey feel important; but when we excel them, they - or\nat least some of them - will feel inferior and envious.\nBy far the best-liked placement counselor in the Mid-town\nPersonnel Agency in New York City was Henrietta\nG ---- It hadn\u2019t always been that way. During the first\nfew months of her association with the agency, Henrietta\ndidn\u2019t have a single friend among her colleagues. Why?\nBecause every day she would brag about the placements\nshe had made, the new accounts she had opened, and\nanything else she had accomplished.\n"I was good at my work and proud of it,\u201d Henrietta\ntold one of our classes. " But instead of my colleagues\nsharing my triumphs, they seemed to resent them. I\nwanted to be liked by these people. I really wanted\nthem to be my friends. After listening to some of the\nsuggestions made in this course, I started to talk about\nmyself less and listen more to my associates. They also\nhad things to boast about and were more excited about\ntelling me about their accomplishments than about listening\nto my boasting. Now, when we have some time\nto chat, I ask them to share their joys with me, and I only\nmention my achievements when they ask.\u201d\nPRINCIPLE 6Let the other person do a great deal of thetalking.\nHOW TO GET COOPERATIONDon\u2019t you have much more faith in ideas that you discover\nfor yourself than in ideas that are handed to you\non a silver platter? If so, isn\u2019t it bad judgment to try to\nram your opinions down the throats of other people?\nIsn\u2019t it wiser to make suggestions - and let the other person\nthink out the conclusion?\nAdolph Seltz of Philadelphia, sales manager in an automobile\nshowroom and a student in one of my courses,\nsuddenly found himself confronted with the necessity of\ninjecting enthusiasm into a discouraged and disorganized\ngroup of automobile salespeople. Calling a sales\nmeeting, he urged his people to tell him exactly what\nthey expected from him. As they talked, he wrote their\nideas on the blackboard. He then said: \u201cI\u2019ll give you all\nthese qualities you expect from me. Now I want you to\ntell me what I have a right to expect from you.\u201d The\nreplies came quick and fast: loyalty, honesty, initiative,\noptimism, teamwork, eight hours a day of enthusiastic\nwork, The meeting ended with a new courage, a new\ninspiration - one salesperson volunteered to work fourteen\nhours a day - and Mr. Seltz reported to me that the\nincrease of sales was phenomenal.\n\u201cThe people had made a sort of moral bargain with\nme, " said Mr. Seltz, \u201cand as long as I lived up to my part\nin it, they were determined to live up to theirs. Consulting\nthem about their wishes and desires was just the shot\nin the arm they needed.\u201d\nNo one likes to feel that he or she is being sold some-\nthing or told to do a thing. We much prefer to feel that\nwe are buying of our own accord or acting on our own\nideas. We like to be consulted about our wishes, our\nwants, our thoughts.\nTake the case of Eugene Wesson. He lost countless\nthousands of dollars in commissions before he learned\nthis truth. Mr. Wesson sold sketches for a studio that\ncreated designs for stylists and textile manufacturers.\nMr. Wesson had called on one of the leading stylists in\nNew York once a week, every week for three years. \u201cHe\nnever refused to see me,\u201d said Mr. Wesson, \u201cbut he\nnever bought. He always looked over my sketches very\ncarefully and then said: \u2018No, Wesson, I guess we don\u2019t\nget together today.\' "\nAfter 150 failures, Wesson realized he must be in a\nmental rut, so he resolved to devote one evening a week\nto the study of influencing human behavior, to help him\ndevelop new ideas and generate new enthusiasm.\nHe decided on this new approach. With half a dozen\nunfinished artists\u2019 sketches under his arm, he rushed\nover to the buyer\u2019s office. "I want you to do me a little\nfavor, if you will,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018Here are some uncompleted\nsketches. Won\u2019t you please tell me how we could finish\nthem up in such a way that you could use them?\u201d\nThe buyer looked at the sketches for a while without\nuttering a word. Finally he said: \u201cLeave these with me\nfor a few days, Wesson, and then come back and see\nme.\u201d\nWesson returned three davs later, got his suggestions,\ntook the sketches back to the studio and had them finished\naccording to the buyer\u2019s ideas. The result? All accepted.\nAfter that, this buyer ordered scores of other sketches\nfrom Wesson, all drawn according to the buyer\u2019s ideas.\n\u201cI realized why I had failed for years to sell him,\u201d said\nMr. Wesson. " I had urged him to buy what I thought he\nought to have. Then I changed my approach completely.\nI urged him to give me his ideas. This made him feel\nthat he was creating the designs. And he was. I didn\u2019t\nhave to sell him. He bought.\u201d\nLetting the other person feel that the idea is his or\nhers not only works in business and politics, it works in\nfamily life as well. Paul M. Davis of Tulsa, Oklahoma,\ntold his class how he applied this principle:\n\u201cMy family and I enjoyed one of the most interesting\nsightseeing vacation trips we have ever taken. I had long\ndreamed of visiting such historic sites as the Civil War\nbattlefield in Gettysburg, Independence Hall in Philadelphia,\nand our nation\u2019s capital. Valley Forge, James-town\nand the restored colonial village of Williamsburg\nwere high on the list of things I wanted to see.\n\u201cIn March my wife, Nancy, mentioned that she had\nideas for our summer vacation which included a tour of\nthe western states, visiting points of interest in New\nMexico, Arizona, California and Nevada. She had\nwanted to make this trip for several years. But we\ncouldn\u2019t obviously make both trips.\n\u201cOur daughter, Anne, had just completed a course in\nU.S. history in junior high school and had become very\ninterested in the events that had shaped our country\u2019s\ngrowth. I asked her how she would like to visit the\nplaces she had learned about on our next vacation. She\nsaid she would love to.\n\u201cTwo evenings later as we sat around the dinner table,\nNancy announced that if we all agreed, the summer\u2019s\nvacation would be to the eastern states, that it would he\na great trip for Anne and thrilling for all of us. We all\nconcurred.\u201d\nThis same psychology was used by an X-ray manufacturer\nto sell his equipment to one of the largest hospitals\nin Brooklyn This hospital was building an addition and\npreparing to equip it with the finest X-ray department in\nAmerica. Dr. L----, who was in charge of the X-ray department,\nwas overwhelmed with sales representatives,\neach caroling the praises of his own company\u2019s equipment.\nOne manufacturer, however, was more skillful. He\nknew far more about handling human nature than the\nothers did. He wrote a letter something like this:\nOur factory has recently completed a new line of X-ray\nequipment. The first shipment of these machines has just\narrived at our office. They are not perfect. We know that,\nand we want to improve them. So we should be deeply\nobligated to you if you could find time to look them over\nand give us your ideas about how they can be made more\nserviceable to your profession. Knowing how occupied you\nare, I shall be glad to send my car for you at any hour you\nspecify.\n"I was surprised to get that letter,\u201d Dr. L ---- said as\nhe related the incident before the class. \u201cI was both\nsurprised and complimented. I had never had an X-ray\nmanufacturer seeking my advice before. It made me feel\nimportant. I was busy every night that week, but I canceled\na dinner appointment in order to look over the\nequipment. The more I studied it, the more I discovered\nfor myself how much I liked it.\n\u201cNobody had tried to sell it to me. I felt that the idea\nof buying that equipment for the hospital was my own. I\nsold myself on its superior qualities and ordered it installed.\u201d\nRalph Waldo Emerson in his essay \u201cSelf-Reliance\u201d\nstated: \u201cIn every work of genius we recognize our own\nrejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain\nalienated majesty.\u201d\nColonel Edward M. House wielded an enormous influence\nin national and international affairs while Woodrow\nWilson occupied the White House. Wilson leaned\nupon Colonel House for secret counsel and advice more\nthan he did upon even members of his own cabinet.\nWhat method did the Colonel use in influencing the\nPresident? Fortunately, we know, for House himself revealed\nit to Arthur D. Howden Smith, and Smith quoted\nHouse in an article in The Saturday Evening Post.\n" \u2018After I got to know the President,\u2019 House said, \u2018I\nlearned the best way to convert him to an idea was to\nplant it in his mind casually, but so as to interest him in\nit - so as to get him thinking about it on his own account.\nThe first time this worked it was an accident. I had been\nvisiting him at the White House and urged a policy on\nhim which he appeared to disapprove. But several days\nlater, at the dinner table, I was amazed to hear him trot\nout my suggestion as his own.\u2019 "\nDid House interrupt him and say, \u201cThat\u2019s not your\nidea. That\u2019s mine\u201d ? Oh, no. Not House. He was too\nadroit for that. He didn\u2019t care about credit. He wanted\nresults. So he let Wilson continue to feel that the idea\nwas his. House did even more than that. He gave Wilson\npublic credit for these ideas.\nLet\u2019s remember that everyone we come in contact\nwith is just as human as Woodrow Wilson. So let\u2019s use\nColonel House\u2019s technique.\nA man up in the beautiful Canadian province of New\nBrunswick used this technique on me and won my patronage.\nI was planning at the time to do some fishing\nand canoeing in New Brunswick. So I wrote the tourist\nbureau for information. Evidently my name and address\nwere put on a mailing list, for I was immediately overwhelmed\nwith scores of letters and booklets and printed\ntestimonials from camps and guides. I was bewildered.\nI didn\u2019t know which to choose. Then one camp owner\ndid a clever thing. He sent me the names and telephone\nnumbers of several New York people who had stayed at\nhis camp and he invited me to telephone them and discover\nfor myself what he had to offer.\nI found to my surprise that I knew one of the men on\nhis list. I telephoned him, found out what his experience\nhad been, and then wired the camp the date of my arrival.\nThe others had been trying to sell me on their service,\nbut one let me sell myself. That organization won.\nTwenty-five centuries ago, Lao-tse, a Chinese sage,\nsaid some things that readers of this book might use\ntoday:\n" The reason why rivers and seas receive the homage\nof a hundred mountain streams is that they keep below\nthem. Thus they are able to reign over all the mountain\nstreams. So the sage, wishing to be above men, putteth\nhimself below them; wishing to be before them, he putteth\nhimself behind them. Thus, though his place be\nabove men, they do not feel his weight; though his place\nbe before them, they do not count it an injury.\u201d\nPRINCIPLE 7Let the other person feel that the idea is his orhers.\nA FORMULA THAT WILL WORKWONDERS FOR YOU\nRemember that other people may be totally wrong. But\nthey don\u2019t think so. Don\u2019t condemn them. Any fool can\ndo that. Try to understand them.

Ferret out that reason - and you have the key\nto his actions, perhaps to his personality\nTry honestly to put yourself in his place.\nIf you say to yourself, \u201cHow would I feel, how would\nI react if I were in his shoes?\u201d you will save yourself\ntime and irritation, for \u201cby becoming interested in the\ncause, we are less likely to dislike the effect.\u201d And, in\naddition, you will sharply increase your skill in human\nrelationships.\n\u201cStop a minute,\u201d says Kenneth M.

Realize then, that\neverybody else in the world feels exactly the same way!\nThen, along with Lincoln and Roosevelt, you will have\ngrasped the only solid foundation for interpersonal relationships;\nnamely, that success in dealing with people\ndepends on a sympathetic grasp of the other persons\u2019\nviewpoint.\u201d\nSam Douglas of Hempstead, New York, used to tell\nhis wife that she spent too much time working on their\nlawn, pulling weeds, fertilizing, cutting the grass twice\na week when the lawn didn\u2019t look any better than it had\nwhen they moved into their home four years earlier. Naturally,\nshe was distressed by his remarks, and each time\nhe made such remarks the balance of the evening was\nruined.\nAfter taking our course, Mr. Douglas realized how\nfoolish he had been all those years. It never occurred to\nhim that she enjoyed doing that work and she might\nreally appreciate a compliment on her diligence.\nOne evening after dinner, his wife said she wanted to\npull some weeds and invited him to keep her company.\nHe first declined, but then thought better of it and went\nout after her and began to help her pull weeds. She was\nvisibly pleased, and together they spent an hour in hard\nwork and pleasant conversation.\nAfter that he often helped her with the gardening and\ncomplimented her on how fine the lawn looked, what a\nfantastic job she was doing with a yard where the soil\nwas like concrete.

Nirenberg, Getting Through to People (Englewood Cliffs,\nN.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1963), p. 31.\nI have always enjoyed walking and riding in a park\nnear my home. Like the Druids of ancient Gaul, I all but\nworship an oak tree, so I was distressed season after\nseason to see the young trees and shrubs killed off by\nneedless fires. These fires weren\u2019t caused by careless\nsmokers. They were almost all caused by youngsters\nwho went out to the park to go native and cook a frankfurter\nor an egg under the trees. Sometimes, these fires\nraged so fiercely that the fire department had to be called\nout to fight the conflagration.\nThere was a sign on the edge of the park saying that\nanyone who started a fire was liable to fine and imprisonment,\nbut the sign stood in an unfrequented part of the\npark, and few of the culprits ever saw it. A mounted\npoliceman was supposed to look after the park; but he\ndidn\u2019t take his duties too seriously, and the fires continued\nto spread season after season. On one occasion, I\nrushed up to a policeman and told him about a fire\nspreading rapidly through the park and wanted him to\nnotify the fire department, and he nonchalantly replied\nthat it was none of his business because it wasn\u2019t in his\nprecinct! I was desperate, so after that when I went riding,\nI acted as a self-appointed committee of one to protect\nthe public domain. In the beginning, I am afraid I\ndidn\u2019t even attempt to see the other people\u2019s point of\nview. When I saw a fire blazing under the trees, I was so\nunhappy about it, so eager to do the right thing, that I\ndid the wrong thing. I would ride up to the boys, warn\nthem that they could be jailed for starting a fire, order\nwith a tone of authority that it be put out; and, if they\nrefused, I would threaten to have them arrested. I was\nmerely unloading my feelings without thinking of their\npoint of view.\nThe result? They obeyed - obeyed sullenly and with\nresentment. After I rode on over the hill, they probably\nrebuilt the fire and longed to burn up the whole park.\nWith the passing of the years, I acquired a trifle more\nknowledge of human relations, a little more tact, a somewhat\ngreater tendency to see things from the other person\u2019s\nstandpoint. Then, instead of giving orders, I would\nride up to a blazing fire and begin something like this:\n\u201cHaving a good time, boys? What are you going to\ncook for supper? . . . I loved to build fires myself when I\nwas a boy - and I still love to. But you know they are\nvery dangerous here in the park. I know you boys don\u2019t\nmean to do any harm, but other boys aren\u2019t so careful.\nThey come along and see that you have built a fire; so\nthey build one and don\u2019t put it out when they go home\nand it spreads among the dry leaves and kills the trees.\nWe won\u2019t have any trees here at all if we aren\u2019t more\ncareful, You could be put in jail for building this fire. But\nI don\u2019t want to be bossy and interfere with your pleasure.\nI like to see you enjoy yourselves; but won\u2019t you\nplease rake all the leaves away from the fire right now")),(0,o.kt)("ul",null,(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},'and you\u2019ll be careful to cover it with dirt, a lot of dirt,\nbefore you leave, won\u2019t you? And the next time you want\nto have some fun, won\u2019t you please build your fire over\nthe hill there in the sandpit? It can\u2019t do any harm there.\n. . . Thanks so much, boys. Have a good time.\u201d\nWhat a difference that kind of talk made! It made the\nboys want to cooperate. No sullenness, no resentment.\nThey hadn\u2019t been forced to obey orders. They had saved\ntheir faces. They felt better and I felt better because I\nhad handled the situation with consideration for their\npoint of view.\nSeeing things through another person\u2019s eyes may ease\ntensions when personal problems become overwhelming.\nElizabeth Novak of New South Wales, Australia,\nwas six weeks late with her car payment. \u201cOn a Friday,\u201d\nshe reported, "I received a nasty phone call from the\nman who was handling my account informing me if I did\nnot come up with $122 by Monday morning I could anticipate\nfurther action from the company. I had no way\nof raising the money over the weekend, so when I received\nhis phone call first thing on Monday morning I\nexpected the worst. Instead of becoming upset I looked\nat the situation from his point of view. I apologized most\nsincerely for causing him so much inconvenience and\nremarked that I must be his most troublesome customer\nas this was not the first time I was behind in my payments.\nHis tone of voice changed immediately, and he\nreassured me that I was far from being one of his really\ntroublesome customers. He went on to tell me several\nexamples of how rude his customers sometimes were,\nhow they lied to him and often tried to avoid talking to\nhim at all. I said nothing. I listened and let him pour out\nhis troubles to me. Then, without any suggestion from\nme, he said it did not matter if I couldn\u2019t pay all the\nmoney immediately. It would be all right if I paid him\n$20 by the end of the month and made up the balance\nwhenever it was convenient for me to do so.\u201d\nTomorrow, before asking anyone to put out a fire or\nbuy your product or contribute to your favorite charity,\nwhy not pause and close your eyes and try to think the\nwhole thing through from another person\u2019s point of\nview? Ask yourself: \u201cWhy should he or she want to do\nit?\u201d True, this will take time, but it will avoid making\nenemies and will get better results - and with less friction\nand less shoe leather.\n"I would rather walk the sidewalk in front of a person\u2019s\noffice for two hours before an interview,\u201d said\nDean Donham of the Harvard business school, \u201cthan\nstep into that office without a perfectly clear idea of what\nI was going to say and what that person - from my\nknowledge of his or her interests and motives - was\nlikely to answer.\u201d\nThat is so important that I am going to repeat it in\nitalics for the sake of emphasis.\nI would rather walk the sidewalk in front of a person\u2019s\noffice for two hours before an interview than step\ninto that office without a perfectly clear idea of what I\nwas going to say and what that persob - from my\nknowledge of his or her interests and motives - was\nlikely to answer.\nIf, as a result of reading this book, you get only one\nthing - an increased tendency to think always in terms\nof the other person\u2019s point of view, and see things from\nthat person\u2019s angle as well as your own - if you get only\nthat one thing from this book, it may easily prove to be\none of the stepping - stones of your career.\nPRINCIPLE 8Try honestly to see things from the otherperson\u2019s point of view.WHAT EVERYBODY WANTSWouldn\'t you like to have a magic phrase that would\nstop arguments, eliminate ill feeling, create good will,\nand make the other person listen attentively?\nYes? All right. Here it is: "I don\u2019t blame you one iota\nfor feeling as you do. If I were you I would undoubtedly\nfeel just as you do.\u201d\nAn answer like that will soften the most cantankerous\nold cuss alive. And you can say that and be 100 percent\nsincere, because if you were the other person you, of\ncourse, would feel just as he does. Take Al Capone, for\nexample. Suppose you had inherited the same body and\ntemperament and mind that Al Capone had. Suppose\nyou had had his environment and experiences. You\nwould then be precisely what he was - and where he\nwas. For it is those things - and only those things - that\nmade him what he was.

Give it to them,\nand they will love you.\nI once gave a broadcast about the author of Little\nWomen, Louisa May Alcott. Naturally, I knew she had\nlived and written her immortal books in Concord, Massachusetts.\nBut, without thinking what I was saying, I\nspoke of visiting her old home in Concord. New Hampshire.\nIf I had said New Hampshire only once, it might\nhave been forgiven. But, alas and alack! I said it twice, I\nwas deluged with letters and telegrams, stinging messages\nthat swirled around my defenseless head like a\nswarm of hornets. Many were indignant. A few insulting.\nOne Colonial Dame, who had been reared in Concord,\nMassachusetts, and who was then living in Philadelphia,\nvented her scorching wrath upon me. She couldn\u2019t have\nbeen much more bitter if I had accused Miss Alcott of\nbeing a cannibal from New Guinea. As I read the letter,\nI said to myself, \u201cThank God, I am not married to that\nwoman.\u201d I felt like writing and telling her that although\nI had made a mistake in geography, she had made a far\ngreater mistake in common courtesy. That was to be just\nmy opening sentence. Then I was going to roll up my\nsleeves and tell her what I really thought. But I didn\u2019t.\nI controlled myself. I realized that any hotheaded\nfool could do that - and that most fools would do just\nthat.\nI wanted to be above fools. So I resolved to try to turn\nher hostility into friendliness. It would be a challenge, a\nsort of game I could play. I said to myself, "After all, if\nI were she, I would probably feel just as she does.\u201d\nSo, I determined to sympathize with her viewpoint.\nThe next time I was in Philadelphia, I called her on the\ntelephone. The conversation went something like\nthis:\nME:Mrs. So-and-So, you wrote me a letter a few weeks\nago, and I want to thank you for it.\nSHE: (in incisive, cultured, well-bred tones): To whom\nhave I the honor of speaking?\nME:I am a stranger to you. My name is Dale Carnegie.\nYou listened to a broadcast I gave about Louisa May\nAlcott a few Sundays ago, and I made the unforgivable\nblunder of saying that she had lived in Concord,\nNew Hampshire. It was a stupid blunder, and\nI want to apologize for it. It was so nice of you to\ntake the time to write me.\nSHE :I am sorry, Mr. Carnegie, that I wrote as I did. I lost\nmy temper. I must apologize.\nME:No! No! You are not the one to apologize; I am. Any\nschool child would have known better than to have\nsaid what I said. I apologized over the air the following\nSunday, and I want to apologize to you personally\nnow.\nSHE :I was born in Concord, Massachusetts. My family\nhas been prominent in Massachusetts affairs for two\ncenturies, and I am very proud of my native state. I\nwas really quite distressed to hear you say that Miss\nAlcott had lived in New Hampshire. But I am really\nashamed of that letter.\nME:I assure you that you were not one-tenth as distressed\nas I am. My error didn\u2019t hurt Massachusetts,\nbut it did hurt me. It is so seldom that people of\nyour standing and culture take the time to write\npeople who speak on the radio, and I do hope you\nwill write me again if you detect an error in my\ntalks.\nSHE:You know, I really like very much the way you have\naccepted my criticism. You must be a very nice person.\nI should like to know you better.\nSo, because I had apologized and sympathized with\nher point of view, she began apologizing and sympathizing\nwith my point of view, I had the satisfaction of\ncontrolling my temper, the satisfaction of returning\nkindness for an insult. I got infinitely more real fun out\nof making her like me than I could ever have gotten out\nof telling her to go and take a jump in the Schuylkill\nRiver,\nEvery man who occupies the White House is faced\nalmost daily with thorny problems in human relations.\nPresident Taft was no exception, and he learned from\nexperience the enormous chemical value of sympathy in\nneutralizing the acid of hard feelings. In his book Ethics\nin Service, Taft gives rather an amusing illustration of\nhow he softened the ire of a disappointed and ambitious\nmother.\n\u201cA lady in Washington,\u201d wrote Taft, \u201cwhose husband\nhad some political influence, came and labored with me\nfor six weeks or more to appoint her son to a position.\nShe secured the aid of Senators and Congressmen in\nformidable number and came with them to see that they\nspoke with emphasis. The place was one requiring technical\nqualification, and following the recommendation\nof the head of the Bureau, I appointed somebody else. I\nthen received a letter from the mother, saying that I was\nmost ungrateful, since I declined to make her a happy\nwoman as I could have done by a turn of my hand. She\ncomplained further that she had labored with her state\ndelegation and got all the votes for an administration bill\nin which I was especially interested and this was the\nway I had rewarded her.\n\u201cWhen you get a letter like that, the first thing you do\nis to think how you can be severe with a person who has\ncommitted an impropriety, or even been a little impertinent.\nThen you may compose an answer. Then if you\nare wise, you will put the letter in a drawer and lock the\ndrawer. Take it out in the course of two days - such communications\nwill always bear two days\u2019 delay in answering'),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},'and when you take it out after that interval, you\nwill not send it. That is just the course I took. After that,\nI sat down and wrote her just as polite a letter as I could,\ntelling her I realized a mother\u2019s disappointment under\nsuch circumstances, but that really the appointment was\nnot left to my mere personal preference, that I had to\nselect a man with technical qualifications, and had,\ntherefore, to follow the recommendations of the head of\nthe Bureau. I expressed the hope that her son would go\non to accomplish what she had hoped for him in the\nposition which he then had. That mollified her and she\nwrote me a note saying she was sorry she had written as\nshe had.\n\u201cBut the appointment I sent in was not confirmed at\nonce, and after an interval I received a letter which purported\nto come from her husband, though it was in the\nthe same handwriting as all the others. I was therein\nadvised that, due to the nervous prostration that had followed\nher disappointment in this case, she had to take\nto her bed and had developed a most serious case of\ncancer of the stomach. Would I not restore her to health\nby withdrawing the first name and replacing it by her\nson\u2019s? I had to write another letter, this one to the husband,\nto say that I hoped the diagnosis would prove to\nbe inaccurate, that I sympathized with him in the sorrow\nhe must have in the serious illness of his wife, but that it\nwas impossible to withdraw the name sent in. The man\nwhom I appointed was confirmed, and within two days\nafter I received that letter, we gave a musicale at the\nWhite House. The first two people to greet Mrs. Taft and\nme were this husband and wife, though the wife had so\nrecently been in articulo mortis."\nJay Mangum represented an elevator-escalator main-tenance\ncompany in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which had the\nmaintenance contract for the escalators in one of Tulsa\u2019s\nleading hotels. The hotel manager did not want to shut\ndown the escalator for more than two hours at a time\nbecause he did not want to inconvenience the hotel\u2019s\nguests. The repair that had to be made would take at\nleast eight hours, and his company did not always have\na specially qualified mechanic available at the convenience\nof the hotel.\nWhen Mr. Mangum was able to schedule a top-flight\nmechanic for this job, he telephoned the hotel manager\nand instead of arguing with him to give him the necessary\ntime, he said:\n\u201cRick, I know your hotel is quite busy and you would\nlike to keep the escalator shutdown time to a minimum.\nI understand your concern about this, and we want to do\neverything possible to accommodate you. However, our\ndiagnosis of the situation shows that if we do not do a\ncomplete job now, your escalator may suffer more serious\ndamage and that would cause a much longer shutdown.\nI know you would not want to inconvenience\nyour guests for several days.\u201d\nThe manager had to agree that an eight-hour shut\ndown was more desirable than several days\'. By sympathizing\nwith the manager\u2019s desire to keep his patrons\nhappy, Mr. Mangum was able to win the hotel manager\nto his way of thinking easily and without rancor.\nJoyce Norris, a piano teacher in St, Louis, Missouri,\ntold of how she had handled a problem piano teachers\noften have with teenage girls. Babette had exceptionally\nlong fingernails. This is a serious handicap to anyone\nwho wants to develop proper piano-playing habits.\nMrs. Norris reported: \u201cI knew her long fingernails\nwould be a barrier for her in her desire to play well.\nDuring our discussions prior to her starting her lessons\nwith me, I did not mention anything to her about her\nnails. I didn\u2019t want to discourage her from taking lessons,\nand I also knew she would not want to lose that\nwhich she took so much pride in and such great care to\nmake attractive.\n\u201cAfter her first lesson, when I felt the time was right,\nI said: \u2018Babette, you have attractive hands and beautiful\nfingernails. If you want to play the piano as well as you\nare capable of and as well as you would like to, you\nwould be surprised how much quicker and easier it\nwould be for you, if you would trim your nails shorter.\nJust think about it, Okay?\u2019 She made a face which was\ndefinitely negative. I also talked to her mother about this\nsituation, again mentioning how lovely her nails were.\nAnother negative reaction. It was obvious that Babette\u2019s\nbeautifully manicured nails were important to her.\n\u201cThe following week Babette returned for her second\nlesson. Much to my surprise, the fingernails had been\ntrimmed. I complimented her and praised her for making\nsuch a sacrifice. I also thanked her mother for influencing\nBabette to cut her nails. Her reply was \u2018Oh, I had\nnothing to do with it. Babette decided to do it on her\nown, and this is the first time she has ever trimmed her\nnails for anyone.\u2019 "\nDid Mrs. Norris threaten Babette? Did she say she\nwould refuse to teach a student with long fingernails?\nNo, she did not. She let Babette know that her finger-\nnails were a thing of beauty and it would be a sacrifice\nto cut them. She implied, \u201cI sympathize with you - I\nknow it won\u2019t be easy, but it will pay off in your better\nmusical development.\u201d\nSol Hurok was probably America\u2019s number one impresario.\nFor almost half a century he handled artists - such\nworld-famous artists as Chaliapin, Isadora Duncan, and\nPavlova. Mr. Hurok told me that one of the first lessons\nhe had learned in dealing with his temperamental stars\nwas the\u2019 necessity for sympathy, sympathy and more\nsympathy with their idiosyncrasies.\nFor three years, he was impresario for Feodor Chaliapin -\none of the greatest bassos who ever thrilled the\nritzy boxholders at the Metropolitan, Yet Chaliapin was\na constant problem. He carried on like a spoiled child.\nTo put it in Mr. Hurok\u2019s own inimitable phrase: \u201cHe\nwas a hell of a fellow in every way.\u201d\nFor example, Chaliapin would call up Mr. Hurok\nabout noun of the day he was going to sing and say, \u201cSol,\nI feel terrible. My throat is like raw hamburger. It is\nimpossible for me to sing tonight.\u201d Did Mr. Hurok argue\nwith him? Oh, no. He knew that an entrepreneur\ncouldn\u2019t handle artists that way. So he would rush over\nto Chaliapin\u2019s hotel, dripping with sympathy. \u201cWhat a\npity, "he would mourn. \u201cWhat a pity! My poor fellow.\nOf course, you cannot sing. I will cancel the engagement\nat once. It will only cost you a couple of thousand dollars,\nbut that is nothing in comparison to your reputation."\nThen Chaliapin would sigh and say, \u201cPerhaps you had\nbetter come over later in the day. Come at five and see\nhow I feel then.\u201d\nAt five o\u2019clock, Mr. Hurok would again rush to his\nhotel, dripping with sympathy. Again he would insist on\ncanceling the engagement and again Chaliapin would\nsigh and say, \u201cWell, maybe you had better come to see\nme later. I may be better then.\u201d\nAt seven-thirty the great basso would consent to sing,\nonly with the understanding that Mr. Hurok would walk\nout on the stage of the Metropolitan and announce that\nChaliapin had a very bad cold and was not in good voice.\nMr. Hurok would lie and say he would do it, for he\nknew that was the only way to get the basso out on the\nstage.\nDr. Arthur I. Gates said in his splendid book Educational\nPsychology: \u201cSympathy the human species universally\ncraves. The child eagerly displays his injury; or\neven inflicts a cut or bruise in order to reap abundant\nsympathy. For the same purpose adults . . . show their\nbruises, relate their accidents, illness, especially details\nof surgical operations. \u2018Self-pity\u2019 for misfortunes real or\nimaginary is in some measure, practically a universal\npractice."\nSo, if you want to win people to your way of thinking,\nput in practice . . .\nPRINCIPLE 9Be sympathetic with the other person\u2019s ideasand desires.\nAN APPEAL THAT EVERYBODY LIKES\nI was reared on the edge of the Jesse James country out\nin Missouri, and I visited the James farm at Kearney,\nMissouri, where the son of Jesse James was then\nliving.\nHis wife told me stories of how Jesse robbed trains\nand held up banks and then gave money to the neighboring\nfarmers to pay off their mortgages.\nJesse James probably regarded himself as an idealist\nat heart, just as Dutch Schultz, "Two Gun\u201d Crowley, Al\nCapone and many other organized crime \u201cgodfathers\u201d\ndid generations later. The fact is that all people you meet\nhave a high regard for themselves and like to be fine and\nunselfish in their own estimation.\nJ. Pierpont Morgan observed, in one of his analytical\ninterludes, that a person usually has two reasons for\ndoing a thing: one that sounds good and a real one.\nThe person himself will think of the real reason. You\ndon\u2019t need to emphasize that. But all of us, being idealists\nat heart, like to think of motives that sound good.\nSo, in order to change people, appeal to the nobler\nmotives.\nIs that too idealistic to work in business? Let\u2019s see.\nLet\u2019s take the case of Hamilton J. Farrell of the Farrell-Mitchell\nCompany of Glenolden, Pennsylvania. Mr. Farrell\nhad a disgruntled tenant who threatened to move.\nThe tenant\u2019s lease still had four months to run; nevertheless,\nhe served notice that he was vacating immediately,\nregardless of lease.\n"These people had lived in my house all winter - the\nmost expensive part of the year,\u201d Mr. Farrell said as he\ntold the story to the class, \u201cand I knew it would be difficult\nto rent the apartment again before fall. I could see\nall that rent income going over the hill and believe me,\nI saw red.\n\u201cNow, ordinarily, I would have waded into that tenant\nand advised him to read his lease again. I would have\npointed out that if he moved, the full balance of his rent\nwould fall due at once - and that I could, and would,\nmove to collect.\n\u201cHowever, instead of flying off the handle and making\na scene, I decided to try other tactics. So I started like\nthis: \u2018Mr. Doe,\u2019 I said, \u2018I have listened to your story,\nand I still don\u2019t believe you intend to move. Years in\nthe renting business have taught me something about\nhuman nature, and I sized you up in the first place as\nbeing a man of your word. In fact, I\u2019m so sure of it that\nI\u2019m willing to take a gamble.\n" \u2018Now, here\u2019s my proposition. Lav your decision on\nthe table for a few days and think it over. If you come\nback to me between now and the first of the month,\nwhen your rent is due, and tell me you still intend to\nmove, I give you my word I will accept your decision as\nfinal. I will privilege you to move and admit to myself\nI\u2019ve been wrong in my judgment. But I still believe\nyou\u2019re a man of your word and will live up to your contract.\nFor after all, we are either men or monkeys - and\nthe choice usually lies with ourselves!\u2019\n\u201cWell, when the new month came around, this gentleman\ncame to see me and paid his rent in person. He and\nhis wife had talked it over, he said - and decided to stay.\nThey had concluded that the only honorable thing to do\nwas to live up to their lease.\u201d\nWhen the late Lord Northcliffe found a newspaper\nusing a picture of him which he didn\u2019t want published,\nhe wrote the editor a letter. But did he say, \u201cPlease do\nnot publish that picture of me any more; Idon\u2019t like it\u201d?\nNo, he appealed to a nobler motive. He appealed to the\nrespect and love that all of us have for motherhood. He\nwrote, \u201cPlease do not publish that picture of me any\nmore. My mother doesn\u2019t like it.\u201d\nWhen John D. Rockefeller, Jr., wished to stop newspaper\nphotographers from snapping pictures of his children,\nhe too appealed to the nobler motives. He didn\u2019t,\nsay: \u201cI don\u2019t want their pictures published.\u201d No, he appealed\nto the desire, deep in all of us, to refrain from\nharming children. He said: \u201cYou know how it is, boys.\nYou\u2019ve got children yourselves, some of you. And you\nknow it\u2019s not good for youngsters to get too much publicity.\u201d\nWhen Cyrus H. K. Curtis, the poor boy from Maine,\nwas starting on his meteoric career, which was destined\nto make him millions as owner of The Saturday Evening\nPost and the Ladies\u2019 Home Journal, he couldn\u2019t afford to\npay his contributors the prices that other magazines\npaid. He couldn\u2019t afford to hire first-class authors to\nwrite for money alone. So he appealed to their nobler\nmotives. For example, he persuaded even Louisa May\nAlcott, the immortal author of Little Women, to write for\nhim when she was at the flood tide of her fame; and he\ndid it by offering to send a check for a hundred dollars,\nnot to her, but to her favorite charity.\nRight here the skeptic may say: \u201cOh, that stuff is all\nright for Northcliffe and Rockefeller or a sentimental\nnovelist. But, I\u2019d like to see you make it work with the\ntough babies I have to collect bills from!\u201d\nYou may be right. Nothing will work in all cases - and\nnothing will work with all people. If you are satisfied\nwith the results you are now getting, why change? If you\nare not satisfied, why not experiment?\nAt any rate, I think you will enjoy reading this\ntrue story told by James L. Thomas, a former student of\nmine:\nSix customers of a certain automobile company refused\nto pay their bills for servicing. None of the customers\nprotested the entire bill, but each claimed that some\none charge was wrong. In each case, the customer had\nsigned for the work done, so the company knew it was\nright - and said so. That was the first mistake.\nHere are the steps the men in the credit department\ntook to collect these overdue bills. Do you suppose they\nsucceeded?')),(0,o.kt)("ol",null,(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"They called on each customer and told him\nbluntly that they had come to collect a bill that was\nlong past due."),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"They made it very plain that the company was\nabsolutely and unconditionally right; therefore he,\nthe customer, was absolutely and unconditionally\nwrong."),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"They intimated that they, the company, knew\nmore about automobiles than he could ever hope to\nknow. So what was the argument about?"),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Result: They argued.\nDid any of these methods reconcile the customer and\nsettle the account? Youcan answer that one yourself.\nAt this stage of affairs, the credit manager was about to\nopen fire with a battery of legal talent, when fortunately\nthe matter came to the attention of the general manager.\nThe manager investigated these defaulting clients and\ndiscovered that they all had the reputation of paying\ntheir bills promptly, Something was wrong here - something\nwas drastically wrong about the method of collection.\nSo he called in James L.

I appealed\nto the nobler motives. \u201cFirst,\u201d I said, "I want you to know\nI also feel this matter has been badly mishandled. You\u2019ve\nbeen inconvenienced and annoyed and irritated by one of\nour representatives. That should never have happened. I\u2019m\nsorry and, as a representative of the company, I apologize.\nAs I sat here and listened to your side of the story, I could\nnot help being impressed by your fairness and patience.\nAnd now, because you are fair - minded and patient, I am\ngoing to ask you to do something for me. It\u2019s something that\nyou can do better than anyone else, something you know\nmore about than anyone else. Here is your bill; I know it is\nsafe for me to ask you to adjust it, just as you would do if\nyou were the president of my company. I am going to leave\nit all up to you. Whatever you say goes.\u201d\nDid he adjust the bill? He certainly did, and got quite a\nkick out of it, The bills ranged from $150 to $400 - but did\nthe customer give himself the best of it? Yes, one of them\ndid! One of them refused to pay a penny of the disputed\ncharge; but the other five all gave the company the best of\nit! And here\u2019s the cream of the whole thing: we delivered\nnew cars to all six of these customers within the next two\nyears!\n\u201cExperience has taught me,\u201d says Mr. Thomas, "that\nwhen no information can be secured about the customer,\nthe only sound basis on which to proceed is to assume\nthat he or she is sincere, honest, truthful and willing and\nanxious to pay the charges, once convinced they are correct.\nTo put it differently and perhaps mare clearly, people\nare honest and want to discharge their obligations.\nThe exceptions to that rule are comparatively few, and I\nam convinced that the individuals who are inclined to\nchisel will in most cases react favorably if you make\nthem feel that you consider them honest, upright and fair."\nPRINCIPLE 10Appeal to the nobler motives.THE MOVIES DO IT. TV DOES IT.WHY DON\u2019T YOU DO IT?Many years ago, the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin was\nbeing maligned by a dangerous whispering campaign. A\nmalicious rumor was being circulated. Advertisers were\nbeing told that the newspaper was no longer attractive\nto readers because it carried too much advertising and\ntoo little news. Immediate action was necessary. The\ngossip had to be squelched.\nBut how?\nThis is the way it was done.\nThe Bulletin clipped from its regular edition all reading\nmatter of all kinds on one average day, classified it,\nand published it as a book. The book was called One\nDay. It contained 307 pages - as many as a hard-covered\nbook; yet the Bulletin had printed all this news and feature\nmaterial on one day and sold it, not for several dollars,\nbut for a few cents.\nThe printing of that book dramatized the fact that the\nBulletin carried an enormous amount of interesting\nreading matter. It conveyed the facts more vividly, more\ninterestingly, more impressively, than pages of figures\nand mere talk could have done.\nThis is the day of dramatization. Merely stating a truth\nisn\u2019t enough. The truth has to be made vivid, interesting,\ndramatic. You have to use showmanship. The movies do\nit. Television does it. And you will have to do it if you\nwant attention.\nExperts in window display know the power of dramazation.\nFor example, the manufacturers of a new rat\npoison gave dealers a window display that included two\nlive rats. The week the rats were shown, sales zoomed\nto five times their normal rate.\nTelevision commercials abound with examples of the\nuse of dramatic techniques in selling products. Sit down\none evening in front of your television set and analyze\nwhat the advertisers do in each of their presentations.\nYou will note how an antacid medicine changes the\ncolor of the acid in a test tube while its competitor\ndoesn\u2019t, how one brand of soap or detergent gets a greasy\nshirt clean when the other brand leaves it gray.

Happy faces\nwill show contentment with a variety of products. All of\nthese dramatize for the viewer the advantages offered by\nwhatever is being sold - and they do get people to buy\nthem.\nYou can dramatize your ideas in business or in any\nother aspect of your life. It\u2019s easy. Jim Yeamans, who\nsells for the NCR company (National Cash Register) in\nRichmond, Virginia, told how he made a sale by dramatic\ndemonstration.\n\u201cLast week I called on a neighborhood grocer and saw\nthat the cash registers he was using at his checkout\ncounters were very old-fashioned. I approached the\nowner and told him: \u2018You are literally throwing away\npennies every time a customer goes through your line.\u2019\nWith that I threw a handful of pennies on the floor.\nHe quickly became more attentive. The mere words\nshould have been of interest to him, but the sound of\nPennies hitting the floor really stopped him. I was able\nto get an order from him to replace all of his old\nmachines.\u201d\nIt works in home life as well. When the old-time lover\nProposed to his sweetheart, did he just use words of\nlove? No! He went down on his knees. That really\nshowed he meant what he said. We don\u2019t propose on our\nknees any more, but many suitors still set up a romantic\natmosphere before they pop the question.\nDramatizing what you want works with children as\nwell. Joe B. Fant, Jr., of Birmingham, Alabama, was having\ndifficulty getting his five-year-old boy and three-year-\nold daughter to pick up their toys, so he invented a\n\u201ctrain.\u201d Joey was the engineer (Captain Casey Jones) on\nhis tricycle. Janet\u2019s wagon was attached, and in the evening\nshe loaded all the \u201ccoal\u201d on the caboose (her\nwagon) and then jumped in while her brother drove her\naround the room. In this way the room was cleaned up"),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},'without lectures, arguments or threats.\nMary Catherine Wolf of Mishawaka, Indiana, was having\nsome problems at work and decided that she had to\ndiscuss them with the boss. On Monday morning she\nrequested an appointment with him but was told he was\nvery busy and she should arrange with his secretary for\nan appointment later in the week. The secretary indicated\nthat his schedule was very tight, but she would try\nto fit her in.\nMs. Wolf described what happened:\n"I did not get a reply from her all week long. Whenever\nI questioned her, she would give me a reason why\nthe boss could not see me. Friday morning came and I\nhad heard nothing definite. I really wanted to see him\nand discuss my problems before the weekend, so I asked\nmyself how I could get him to see me.\n\u201cWhat I finally did was this. I wrote him a formal letter.\nI indicated in the letter that I fully understood how\nextremely busy he was all week, but it was important\nthat I speak with him. I enclosed a form letter and a self-\naddressed envelope and asked him to please fill it out or\nask his secretary to do it and return it to me.

There was my self-addressed envelope.\nHe had answered my form letter himself and\nindicated he could see me that afternoon and could give\nme ten minutes of his time. I met with him, and we\ntalked for over an hour and resolved my problems.\n\u201cIf I had not dramatized to him the fact that I really\nwanted to see him, I would probably be still waiting for\nan appointment.\u201d\nJames B. Boynton had to present a lengthy market report.\nHis firm had just finished an exhaustive study for a\nleading brand of cold cream. Data were needed immediately\nabout the competition in this market; the prospective\ncustomer was one of the biggest - and most\nformidable - men in the advertising business.\nAnd his first approach failed almost before he began.\n\u201cThe first time I went in,\u201d Mr. Boynton explains, "I\nfound myself sidetracked into a futile discussion of the\nmethods used in the investigation. He argued and I argued.\nHe told me I was wrong, and I tried to prove that\nI was right.\n"I finally won my point, to my own satisfaction - but\nmy time was up, the interview was over, and I still\nhadn\u2019t produced results.\n"The second time, I didn\u2019t bother with tabulations of\nfigures and data, I went to see this man, I dramatized my\nfacts I.\n\u201cAs I entered his office, he was busy on the phone.\nWhile he finished his conversation, I opened a suitcase\nand dumped thirty-two jars of cold cream on top of his\ndesk - all products he knew - all competitors of his\ncream.\n\u201cOn each jar, I had a tag itemizing the results of the\ntrade investigation, And each tag told its story briefly,\ndramatically.\n\u201cWhat happened?\n\u201cThere was no longer an argument. Here was something\nnew, something different. He picked up first one\nand then another of the jars of cold cream and read the\ninformation on the tag. A friendly conversation developed.\nHe asked additional questions. He was intensely\ninterested. He had originally given me only ten minutes\nto present my facts, but ten minutes passed, twenty minutes,\nforty minutes, and at the end of an hour we were\nstill talking.\n\u201cI was presenting the same facts this time that I had\npresented previously.

But\nnothing works. They just won\u2019t produce.\u201d\nThis conversation took place at the end of the day, just\nbefore the night shift came on. Schwab asked the manager\nfor a piece of chalk, then, turning to the nearest\nman, asked: \u201cHow many heats did your shift make\ntoday?\u201d\n"Six."\nWithout another word, Schwab chalked a big figure\nsix on the floor, and walked away.\nWhen the night shift came in, they saw the \u201c6\u201d and\nasked what it meant.\n\u201cThe big boss was in here today,\u201d the day people said.\n\u201cHe asked us how many heats we made, and we told\nhim six. He chalked it down on the floor.\u201d\nThe next morning Schwab walked through the mill\nagain. The night shift had rubbed out \u201c6\u201d and replaced\nit with a big \u201c7.\u201d\nWhen the day shift reported for work the next morning,\nthey saw a big \u201c7\u201d chalked on the floor. So the night\nshift thought they were better than the day shift did\nthey? Well, they would show the night shift a thing or\ntwo. The crew pitched in with enthusiasm, and when\nthey quit that night, they left behind them an enormous,\nswaggering "10." Things were stepping up.\nShortly this mill, which had been lagging way behind\nin production, was turning out more work than any other\nmill in the plant.\nThe principle?\nLet Charles Schwab say it in his own words: \u201cThe\nway to get things done,\u201d say Schwab, \u201cis to stimulate\ncompetition. I do not mean in a sordid, money-getting\nway, but in the desire to excel.\u201d\nThe desire to excel! The challenge! Throwing down\nthe gauntlet! An infallible way of appealing to people of\nspirit.\nWithout a challenge, Theodore Roosevelt would never\nhave been President of the United States. The Rough\nRider, just back from Cuba, was picked for governor of\nNew York State. The opposition discovered he was no\nlonger a legal resident of the state, and Roosevelt,\nfrightened, wished to withdraw. Then Thomas Collier\nPlatt, then U.S. Senator from New York, threw down the\nchallenge. Turning suddenly on Theodore Roosevelt, he\ncried in a ringing voice: \u201cIs the hero of San Juan Hill a\ncoward?\u201d\nRoosevelt stayed in the fight - and the rest is history.\nA challenge not only changed his life; it had a real effect\nupon the future of his nation.\n\u201cAll men have fears, but the brave put down their\nfears and go forward, sometimes to death, but always to\nvictory\u201d was the motto of the King\u2019s Guard in ancient\nGreece. What greater challenge can be offered than the\nopportunity to overcome those fears?\nWhen Al Smith was governor of New York, he was up\nagainst it. Sing Sing, at the time the most notorious pen-\nitentiary west of Devil\'s Island, was without a warden.\nScandals had been sweeping through the pristin walls,\nscandals and ugly rumors. Smith needed a strong man to\nrule Sing Sing - an iron man. But who? He sent for\nLewis E. Lawes of New Hampton.\n\u201cHow about going up to take charge of Sing Sing?\u201d he\nsaid jovially when Lawes stood before him. \u201cThey need\na man up there with experience.\u201d\nLawes was flabbergasted. He knew the dangers of\nSing Sing. It was a political appointment, subject to the\nvagaries of political whims. Wardens had come and gone'),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},'one had lasted only three weeks. He had a career to\nconsider. Was it worth the risk?\nThen Smith, who saw his hesitation, leaned back in\nhis chair and smiled. \u201cYoung fellow,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t\nblame you for being scared. It\u2019s a tough spot. It\u2019ll take a\nbig person to go up there and stay.\u201d\nSo Smith was throwing down a challenge, was he?\nLawes liked the idea of attempting a job that called for\nsomeone \u201cbig.\u201d\nSo he went. And he stayed. He stayed, to become the\nmost famous warden of his time. His book 20,000 Years\nin Sing Singsold into the hundred of thousands of copies.\nHis broadcasts on the air and his stories of prison\nlife have inspired dozens of movies. His \u201chumanizing\u201d\nof criminals wrought miracles in the way of prison reform.\n\u201cI have never found,\u201d said Harvey S. Firestone,\nfounder of the great Firestone Tire and Rubber Company,\n\u201cthat pay and pay alone would either bring together\nor hold good people. I think it was the game\nitself.\u201d\nFrederic Herzberg, one of the great behavorial scientists,\nconcurred. He studied in depth the work attitudes\nof thousands of people ranging from factory workers to\nsenior executives. What do you think he found to be the\nmost motivating factor - the one facet of the jobs that\nwas most stimulating? Money? Good working conditions?\nFringe benefits? No - not any of those. The one\nmajor factor that motivated people was the work itself. If\nthe work was exciting and interesting, the worker looked\nforward to doing it and was motivated to do a good job.\nThat is what every successful person loves: the game.\nThe chance for self-expression. The chance to prove his\nor her worth, to excel, to win. That is what makes foot-races\nand hog-calling and pie-eating contests. The desire\nto excel. The desire for a feeling of importance.\nPRINCIPLE 12Throw down a challenge.\nI n a N u t s h e l l WIN PEOPLE TO YOUR WAY OF THINKING\nPRINCIPLE 1\nThe only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.\nPRINCIPLE 2\nShow respect for the other person\u2019s opinions.

It was so\nunusual, so unexpected, that the secretary blushed in\nconfusion. Then Coolidge said, \u201cNow, don\u2019t get stuck\nup. I just said that to make you feel good. From now on,\nI wish you would be a little bit more careful with your\nPunctuation.\u201d\nHis method was probably a bit obvious, but the psychology\nwas superb. It is always easier to listen to unpleasant\nthings after we have heard some praise of our\ngood points.\nA barber lathers a man before he shaves him; and that\nis precisely what McKinley did back in 1896, when he\nwas running for President. One of the prominent Republicans\nof that day had written a campaign speech that he\nfelt was just a trifle better than Cicero and Patrick Henry\nand Daniel Webster all rolled into one. With great glee,\nthis chap read his immortal speech aloud to McKinley.\nThe speech had its fine points, but it just wouldn\u2019t do. It\nwould have raised a tornado of criticism. McKinley\ndidn\u2019t want to hurt the man\u2019s feelings. He must not kill\nthe man\u2019s splendid enthusiasm, and yet he had to say\n"no." Note how adroitly he did it.\n"My friend, that is a splendid speech, a magnificent\nspeech,\u201d McKinley said. \u201cNo one could have prepared a\nbetter one. There are many occasions on which it would\nbe precisely the right thing to say, but is it quite suitable\nto this particular occasion? Sound and sober as it is from\nyour standpoint, I must consider its effect from the\nparty\u2019s standpoint. Now you go home and write a speech\nalong the lines I indicate, and send me a copy of it.\u201d\nHe did just that. McKinley blue-penciled and helped\nhim rewrite his second speech, and he became one of\nthe effective speakers of the campaign.\nHere is the second most famous letter that Abraham\nLincoln ever wrote. (His most famous one was written to\nMrs. Bixby, expressing his sorrow for the death of the\nfive sons she had lost in battle.) Lincoln probably dashed\nthis letter off in five minutes; yet it sold at public auction\nin 1926 for twelve thousand dollars, and that, by the\nway, was more money than Lincoln was able to save\nduring half a century of hard work. The letter was written\nto General Joseph Hooker on April 26, 1863, during\nthe darkest period of the Civil War. For eighteen\nmonths, Lincoln\u2019s generals had been leading the Union\nArmy from one tragic defeat to another. Nothing but futile,\nstupid human butchery. The nation was appalled.\nThousands of soldiers had deserted from the army, and\nen the Republican members of the Senate had revolted\nand wanted to force Lincoln out of the White House.\n\u201cWe are now on the brink of destruction,\u201d Lincoln\nsaid. It appears to me that even the Almighty is\nagainst us. I can hardly see a ray of hope.\u201d Such was the\nblack sorrow and chaos out of which this letter\ncame.\nI am printing the letter here because it shows how\nLincoln tried to change an obstreperous general when\nthe very fate of the nation could have depended upon\nthe general\u2019s action.\nThis is perhaps the sharpest letter Abe Lincoln wrote\nafter he became President; yet you will note that he\npraised General Hooker before he spoke of his grave\nfaults.\nYes, they were grave faults, but Lincoln didn\u2019t call\nthem that. Lincoln was more conservative, more diplomatic.\nLincoln wrote: \u201cThere are some things in regard\nto which I am not quite satisfied with you.\u201d Talk about\ntact! And diplomacy!\nHere is the letter addressed to General Hooker:\nI have placed you at the head of the Army of the Potomac.\nOf course, I have done this upon what appears to me to be\nsufficient reasons, and yet I think it best for you to know\nthat there are some things in regard to which I am not quite\nsatisfied with you.\nI believe you to be a brave and skillful soldier, which, of\ncourse, I like. I also believe you do not mix politics with\nyour profession, in which you are right. You have confidence\nin yourself, which is a valuable if not an indispensable\nquality.\nYou are ambitious, which, within reasonable bounds,\ndoes good rather than harm, But I think that during General\nBurnside\u2019s command of the army you have taken counsel of\nyour ambition and thwarted him as much as you could, in\nwhich you did a great wrong to the country and to a most\nmeritorious and honorable brother officer.\nI have heard, in such a way as to believe it, of your recently\nsaying that both the army and the Government\nneeded a dictator. Of course, it was not for this, but in spite\nof it, that I have given you command.\nOnly those generals who gain successes can set up as\ndictators. What I now ask of you is military success and I\nwill risk the dictatorship.\nThe Government will support you to the utmost of its\nability, which is neither more nor less than it has done and\nwill do for all commanders. I much fear that the spirit which\nyou have aided to infuse into the army, of criticizing their\ncommander and withholding confidence from him, will\nnow turn upon you. I shall assist you, as far as I can, to put\nit down.\nNeither you nor Napoleon, if he were alive again, could\nget any good out of an army while such spirit prevails in it,\nand now beware of rashness. Beware of rashness, but with\nenergy and sleepless vigilance go forward and give us victories.\nYou are not a Coolidge, a McKinley or a Lincoln. You\nwant to know whether this philosophy will operate for\nyou in everyday business contacts. Will it? Let\u2019s see.\nLet\u2019s take the case of W. P. Gaw of the Wark Company,\nPhiladelphia.\nThe Wark Company had contracted to build and complete\na large office building in Philadelphia by a certain\nspecified date. Everything was going along well; the\nbuilding was almost finished, when suddenly the sub-contractor\nmaking the ornamental bronze work to go on\nthe exterior of this building declared that he couldn\u2019t\nmake delivery on schedule. What! An entire building\nheld up! Heavy penalties! Distressing losses! All because\nof one man!\nLong-distance telephone calls. Arguments! Heated\nconversations! All in vain. Then Mr. Gaw was sent to\nNew York to beard the bronze lion in his den.\n\u201cDo you know you are the only person in Brooklyn\nwith your name,?" Mr Gaw asked the president of the\nsubcontracting firm shortly after they were introduced.\nThe president was surprised. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t know\nthat.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Mr. Gaw, \u201cwhen I got off the train this\nmorning, I looked in the telephone book to get your\naddress, and you\u2019re the only person in the Brooklyn\nphone book with your name.\u201d\n\u201cI never knew that,\u201d the subcontractor said. He\nchecked the phone book with interest. \u201cWell, it\u2019s an unusual\nname,\u201d he said proudly. "My family came from\nHolland and settled in New York almost two hundred\nyears ago. " He continued to talk about his family and his\nancestors for several minutes. When he finished that,\nMr. Gaw complimented him on how large a plant he had\nand compared it favorably with a number of similar\nplants he had visited. \u201cIt is one of the cleanest and neatest\nbronze factories I ever saw,\u201d said Gaw.\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent a lifetime building up this business,\u201d the\nsubcontractor said, \u201cand I am rather proud of it. Would\nyou like to take a look around the factory?\u201d\nDuring this tour of inspection, Mr. Gaw complimented\nthe other man on his system of fabrication and\ntold him how and why it seemed superior to those of\nsome of his competitors. Gaw commented on some unusual\nmachines, and the subcontractor announced that\nhe himself had invented those machines. He spent considerable\ntime showing Gaw how they operated and the\nsuperior work they turned out. He insisted on taking his\nvisitor to lunch. So far, mind you, not a word had been\nsaid about the real purpose of Gaw\u2019s visit.\nAfter lunch, the subcontractor said, \u201cNow, to get down\nto business. Naturally, I know why you\u2019re here. I didn\u2019t\nexpect that our meeting would be so enjoyable. You can\ngo back to Philadelphia with my promise that your material\nwill be fabricated and shipped, even if other orders\nhave to be delayed.\u201d\nMr. Gaw got everything that he wanted without even\nasking for it. The material arrived on time, and the building\nwas completed on the day the completion contract\nspecified.\nWould this have happened had Mr. Gaw used the\nhammer-and-dynamite method generally employed on\nsuch occasions?\nDorothy Wrublewski, a branch manager of the Fort\nMonmouth, New Jersey, Federal Credit Union, reported\nto one of our classes how she was able to help one of her\nemployees become more productive.\n\u201cWe recently hired a young lady as a teller trainee.\nHer contact with our customers was very good. She was\naccurate and efficient in handling individual transactions.\nThe problem developed at the end of the day\nwhen it was time to balance out.\n\u201cThe head teller came to me and strongly suggested\nthat I fire this woman. \u2018She is holding up everyone else\nbecause she is so slow in balancing out. I\u2019ve shown her\nover and over, but she can\u2019t get it. She\u2019s got to go.\u2019\n\u201cThe next day I observed her working quickly and\naccurately when handling the normal everyday transactions,\nand she was very pleasant with our customers.\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t take long to discover why she had trouble\nbalancing out. After the office closed, I went over to talk\nwith her. She was obviously nervous and upset. I\npraised her for being so friendly and outgoing with the\ncustomers and complimented her for the accuracy and\nspeed used in that work. I then suggested we review the\nprocedure we use in balancing the cash drawer. Once\nshe realized I had confidence in her, she easily followed\nmy suggestions and soon mastered this function. We\nhave had no problems with her since then.\u201d\nBeginning with praise is like the dentist who begins\nhis work with Novocain. The patient still gets a drilling,\nbut the Novocain is pain-killing. A leader will use . . .\nPRINCIPLE 1Begin with praise and honest appreciation.\nHOW TO CRITICIZE-AND NOT BEHATED FOR ITCharles Schwab was passing through one of his steel\nmills one day at noon when he came across some of his\nemployees smoking. Immediately above their heads was\na sign that said \u201cNo Smoking.\u201d Did Schwab point to the\nsign and say, \u201cCan\u2019t you read.? Oh, no not Schwab. He\nwalked over to the men, handed each one a cigar, and\nsaid, \u201cI\u2019ll appreciate it, boys, if you will smoke these on\nthe outside.\u201d They knew that he knew that they had\nbroken a rule - and they admired him because he said\nnothing about it and gave them a little present and made\nthem feel important. Couldn\u2019t keep from loving a man\nlike that, could you?\nJohn Wanamaker used the same technique. Wanamaker\nused to make a tour of his great store in Philadelphia\nevery day. Once he saw a customer waiting at a\ncounter. No one was paying the slightest attention to\nher. The salespeople? Oh, they were in a huddle at the\nfar end of the counter laughing and talking among themselves.\nWanamaker didn\u2019t say a word. Quietly slipping\nbehind the counter, he waited on the woman himself\nand then handed the purchase to the salespeople to be\nwrapped as he went on his way.\nPublic officials are often criticized for not being accessible\nto their constituents. They are busy people, and\nthe fault sometimes lies in overprotective assistants who\ndon\u2019t want to overburden their bosses with too many\nvisitors. Carl Langford, who has been mayor of Orlando,\nFlorida, the home of Disney World, for many years, frequently\nadmonished his staff to allow people to see him.\nclamed he had an \u201copen-door\u201d policy; yet the citizens\nof his community were blocked by secretaries and\nadministrators when they called.\nFinally the mayor found the solution. He removed the\ndoor from his office! His aides got the message, and the\nmayor has had a truly open administration since the day\nhis door was symbolically thrown away.\nSimply changing one three-letter word can often spell\nthe difference between failure and success in changing\npeople without giving offense or arousing resentment.\nMany people begin their criticism with sincere praise\nfollowed by the word \u201cbut\u201d and ending with a critical\nstatement. For example, in trying to change a child\u2019s\ncareless attitude toward studies, we might say, \u201cWe\u2019re\nreally proud of you, Johnnie, for raising your grades this\nterm. Butif you had worked harder on your algebra, the\nresults would have been better.\u201d\nIn this case, Johnnie might feel encouraged until he\nheard the word \u201cbut.\u201d He might then question the sincerity\nof the original praise. To him, the praise seemed\nonly to be a contrived lead-in to a critical inference of\nfailure. Credibility would be strained, and we probably\nwould not achieve our objectives of changing Johnnie\u2019s\nattitude toward his studies.\nThis could be easily overcome by changing the word\n"but" to "and." \u201cWe\u2019re really proud of you, Johnnie, for\nraiseing your grades this term, andby continuing the\nsame conscientious efforts next term, your algebra grade\ncan be up with all the others.\u201d\nNow, Johnnie would accept the praise because there\nwas no follow-up of an inference of failure. We have\ncalled his attention to the behavior we wished to change\nindirectly and the chances are he will try to live up to\nour expectations.\nCalling attention to one\u2019s mistakes indirectly works\nwonders with sensitive people who may resent bitterly\nany direct criticism. Marge Jacob of Woonsocket, Rhode\nIsland, told one of our classes how she convinced some\nsloppy construction workers to clean up after themselves\nwhen they were building additions to her house.\nFor the first few days of the work, when Mrs. Jacob\nreturned from her job, she noticed that the yard was\nstrewn with the cut ends of lumber. She didn\u2019t want to\nantagonize the builders, because they did excellent\nwork. So after the workers had gone home, she and her\nchildren picked up and neatly piled all the lumber debris\nin a corner. The following morning she called the\nforeman to one side and said, \u201cI\u2019m really pleased with\nthe way the front lawn was left last night; it is nice and\nclean and does not offend the neighbors.\u201d From that day\nforward the workers picked up and piled the debris to\none side, and the foreman came in each day seeking\napproval of the condition the lawn was left in after a\nday\u2019s work.\nOne of the major areas of controversy between members\nof the army reserves and their regular army trainers\nis haircuts. The reservists consider themselves civilians\n(which they are most of the time) and resent having to\ncut their hair short.\nMaster Sergeant Harley Kaiser of the 542nd USAR\nSchool addressed himself to this problem when he was\nworking with a group of reserve noncommissioned officers.\nAs an old-time regular-army master sergeant, he\nmight have been expected to yell at his troops and\nthreaten them. Instead he chose to make his point indirectly.\n\u201cGentlemen,\u201d he started, \u201cyou are leaders. You will\nbe most effective when you lead by example. You must\nbe the example for your men to follow. You know what\nthe army regulations say about haircuts. I am going to\nget my hair cut today, although it is still much shorter\nthan some of yours. You look at yourself in the mirror,\nand if you feel you need a haircut to be a good example,\nwe\'ll arrange time for you to visit the post barbership.\u201d\nThe result was predictable. Several of the candidates\ndid look in the mirror and went to the barbershop that\nafternoon and received \u201cregulation\u201d haircuts. Sergeant\nKaiser commented the next morning that he already\ncould see the development of leadership qualities in\nsome of the members of the squad.\nOn March 8, 1887, the eloquent Henry Ward Beecher\ndied. The following Sunday, Lyman Abbott was invited\nto speak in the pulpit left silent by Beecher\u2019s passing.\nEager to do his best, he wrote, rewrote and polished his\nsermon with the meticulous care of a Flaubert. Then he\nread it to his wife. It was poor - as most written speeches\nare. She might have said, if she had had less judgment,\n\u201cLyman, that is terrible. That\u2019ll never do. You\u2019ll put people\nto sleep. It reads like an encyclopedia. You ought to\nknow better than that after all the years you have been\npreaching. For heaven\u2019s sake, why don\u2019t you talk like a\nhuman being? Why don\u2019t you act natural? You\u2019ll disgrace\nyourself if you ever read that stuff.\u201d\nThat\u2019s what shemight have said. And, if she had, you\nknow what would have happened. And she knew too.\nSo, she merely remarked that it would make an excellent\narticle for the North American Review. In other words,\nshe praised it and at the same time subtly suggested that\nit wouldn\u2019t do as a speech. Lyman Abbott saw the point,\ntore up his carefully prepared manuscript and preached\nwithout even using notes.\nAn effective way to correct others\u2019 mistakes is . . .\nPRINCIPLE 2Call attention to people\u2019s mistakes indirectly.\nTALK ABOUT YOUR OWNMISTAKES FIRSTMy niece, Josephine Carnegie, had come to New York\nto be my secretary. She was nineteen, had graduated\nfrom high school three years previously, and her business\nexperience was a trifle more than zero. She became\none of the most proficient secretaries west of Suez, but\nin the beginning, she was - well, susceptible to improvement.\nOne day when I started to criticize her, I\nsaid to myself: \u201cJust a minute, Dale Carnegie; just a\nminute. You are twice as old as Josephine. You have had\nten thousand times as much business experience. How\ncan you possibly expect her to have your viewpoint, your\njudgment, your initiative - mediocre though they may\nbe? And just a minute, Dale, what were you doing at\nnineteen? Remember the asinine mistakes and blunders\nyou made? Remember the time you did this . . . and\nthat . . . ?"\nAfter thinking the matter over, honestly and impartially,\nI concluded that Josephine\u2019s batting average at\nnineteen was better than mine had been - and that, I\u2019m\nsorry to confess, isn\u2019t paying Josephine much of a compliment.\nSo after that, when I wanted to call Josephine\u2019s attention\nto a mistake, I used to begin by saying, \u201cYou have\nmade a mistake, Josephine, but the Lord knows, it\u2019s no\nworse than many I have made. You were not born with\njudgment. That comes only with experience, and you are\nbetter than I was at your age. I have been guilty of so\nmany stupid, silly things myself, I have very little incliion\nto criticize you or anyone. But don\u2019t you think it\nwould have been wiser if you had done so and so?"\nIt isn\u2019t nearly so difficult to listen to a recital of your\nfaults if the person criticizing begins by humbly admitting\nthat he, too, is far from impeccable.\nE. G. Dillistone, an engineer in Brandon, Manitoba,\nCanada, was having problems with his new secretary.\nLetters he dictated were coming to his desk for signature\nwith two or three spelling mistakes per page. Mr. Dillistone\nreported how he handled this:\n\u201cLike many engineers, I have not been noted for my\nexcellent English or spelling. For years I have kept a\nlittle black thumb - index book for words I had trouble\nspelling. When it became apparent that merely pointing\nout the errors was not going to cause my secretary to do\nmore proofreading and dictionary work, I resolved to\ntake another approach. When the next letter came to my\nattention that had errors in it, I sat down with the typist\nand said:\n" \u2018Somehow this word doesn\u2019t look right. It\u2019s one of\nthe words I always have had trouble with. That\u2019s the reason\nI started this spelling book of mine. ',"[I opened\nthe book to the appropriate page.]",' Yes, here it is. I\u2019m\nvery conscious of my spelling now because people do\njudge us by our letters and misspellings make us look\nless professional.\n"I don\'t know whether she copied my system or not,\nbut since that conversation, her frequency of spelling\nerrors has been significantly reduced.\u201d\nThe polished Prince Bernhard von B\xfclow learned the\nsharp necessity of doing this back in 1909. Von B\xfclow\nwas then the Imperial Chancellor of Germany, and on\nthe throne satWilhelm II-Wilhelm, the haughty; Wilhelm\nthe arrogant; Wilhelm, the last of the German Kaisers,\nbuilding an army and navy that he boasted could\nwhip their weight in wildcats\nThen an astonishing thing happened. The Kaiser said\nthings, incredible things, things that rocked the continent\nand started a series of explosions heard around the\nworld. To make matters infinitely worse, the Kaiser\nmade silly, egotistical, absurd announcements in public,\nhe made them while he was a guest in England, and he\ngave his royal permission to have them printed in the\nDaily Telegraph. For example, he declared that he was\nthe only German who felt friendly toward the English;\nthat he was constructing a navy against the menace of\nJapan; that he, and he alone, had saved England from\nbeing humbled in the dust by Russia and France; that it\nhad been his campaign plan that enabled England\u2019s\nLord Roberts to defeat the Boers in South Africa; and so\non and on.\nNo other such amazing words had ever fallen from the\nlips of a European king in peacetime within a hundred\nyears. The entire continent buzzed with the fury of a\nhornet\u2019s nest. England was incensed. German statesmen\nwere aghast. And in the midst of all this consternation,\nthe Kaiser became panicky and suggested to Prince von\nB\xfclow, the Imperial Chancellor, that he take the blame.\nYes, he wanted von B\xfclow to announce that it was all\nhis responsibility, that he had advised his monarch to\nsay these incredible things.\n\u201cBut Your Majesty,\u201d von B\xfclow protested, \u201cit seems\nto me utterly impossible that anybody either in Germany\nor England could suppose me capable of having advised\nYour Majesty to say any such thing.\u201d\nThe moment those words were out of von B\xfclow\'s\nmouth, he realized he had made a grave mistake. The\nKaiser blew up.\n\u201cYou consider me a donkey,\u201d he shouted, \u201ccapable of\nblunders you yourself could never have committed!\u201d\nVon B\xfclow\'s knew that he ought to have praised before\nhe condemned; but since that was too late, he did the\nnext best thing. He praised after he had criticized. And\nit worked a miracle.\n"I\'m far from suggesting that,\u201d he answered respectfully.\n\u201cYour Majesty surpasses me in manv respects; not\nonly of course, in naval and military knowledge but\nabove all, in natural science. I have often listened in\nadmiration when Your Majesty explained the barometer,\nor wireless telegraphy, or the Roentgen rays. I am\nshamefully ignorant of all branches of natural science,\nhave no notion of chemistry or physics, and am quite\nincapable of explaining the simplest of natural phenomena.\nBut,\u201d von B\xfcllow continued, \u201cin compensation, I\npossess some historical knowledge and perhaps certain\nqualities useful in politics, especially in diplomacy.\u201d\nThe Kaiser beamed. Von Bulow had praised him. Von\nB\xfclow had exalted him and humbled himself. The Kaiser\ncould forgive anything after that. \u201cHaven\u2019t I always\ntold you," he exclaimed with enthusiasm, \u201cthat we complete\none another famously? We should stick together,\nand we will!"\nHe shook hands with von B\xfclow, not once, but several\ntimes. And later in the day he waxed so enthusiastic that\nhe exclaimed with doubled fists, \u201cIf anyone says anything\nto me against Prince von B\xfclow, Ishall punch him\nin the nose.\u201d\nVon B\xfclow saved himself in time - but, canny diplomat\nthat he was, he nevertheless had made one error: he\nshould have begun by talking about his own shortcomings\nand Wilhelm\u2019s superiority - not by intimating that\nthe Kaiser wasa half-wit in need of a guardian.\nIf a few sentences humbling oneself and praising the\nother party can turn a haughty, insulted Kaiser into a\nstaunch friend, imagine what humility and praise can do\nfor you and me in our daily contacts. Rightfully used,\nthey will work veritable miracles in human relations.\nAdmitting one\u2019s own mistakes - even when one hasn\u2019t\ncorrected them - can help convince somebody to change\nhis behavior. This was illustrated more recently by Clarence\nZerhusen of Timonium, Maryland, when he discovered\nhis fifteen-year-old son was experimenting with\ncigarettes.\n\u201cNaturally, I didn\u2019t want David to smoke,\u201d Mr. Zerhusen\ntold us, \u201cbut his mother and I smoked cigarettes;\nwe were giving him a bad example all the time. I explained\nto Dave how I started smoking at about his age\nand how the nicotine had gotten the best of me and now\nit was nearly impossible for me to stop. I reminded him\nhow irritating my cough was and how he had been after\nme to give up cigarettes not many years before.\n"I didn\u2019t exhort him to stop or make threats or warn\nhim about their dangers. All I did was point out how I\nwas hooked on cigarettes and what it had meant to me.\n\u201cHe thought about it for a while and decided he\nwouldn\u2019t smoke until he had graduated from high\nschool. As the years went by David never did start smoking\nand has no intention of ever doing so.\n\u201cAs a result of that conversation I made the decision\nto stop smoking cigarettes myself, and with the support\nof my family, I have succeeded.\u201d\nA good leader follows this principle:\nPRINCIPLE 3Talk about your own mistakes beforecriticizing the other person.NO ONE LIKES TO TAKE ORDERS\nI once had the pleasure of dining with Miss Ida Tarbell,\nthe dean of American biographers. When I told her I was\nwriting this book, we began discussing this all-important\nsubject of getting along with people, and she told me\nthat while she was writing her biography of Owen D.\nYoung, she interviewed a man who had sat for three\nyears in the same office with Mr. Young. This man declared\nthat during all that time he had never heard Owen\nD. Young give a direct order to anyone. He always gave\nsuggestions, not orders. Owen D. Young never said, for\nexample, \u201cDo this or do that,\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t do this or don\u2019t\ndo that.\u201d He would say, \u201cYou might consider this,\u201d or\n\u201cDo you think that would work?\u201d Frequently he would\nsay, after he had dictated a letter, \u201cWhat do you think of\nthis?\u201d In looking over a letter of one of his assistants, he\nwould say, \u201cMaybe if we were to phrase it this way it\nwould be better.\u201d He always gave people the opportunity\nto do things themselves; he never told his assistants\nto do things; he let them do them, let them learn from\ntheir mistakes.\nA technique like that makes it easy for a person to\ncorrect errors. A technique like that saves a person\u2019s\npride and gives him or her a feeling of importance. It\nencourages cooperation instead of rebellion.\nResentment caused by a brash order may last a long\ntime -even if the order was given to correct an obviously\nbad situation. Dan Santarelli, a teacher at a vocational\nschool in Wyoming, Pennsylvania, told one of\nour classes how one of his students had blocked the entrance\nway to one of the school\u2019s shops by illegally parking\nhis car in it. One of the other instructors stormed into\nthe classroom and asked in an arrogant tone, \u201cWhose car\nis blocking the driveway?" When the student who\nowned the car responded, the instructor screamed:\n\u201cMove that car and move it right now, or I\u2019ll wrap a\nchain around it and drag it out of there.\u201d\nNow that student was wrong. The car should not have\nbeen parked there. But from that day on, not only did\nthat student resent the instructor\u2019s action, but all the\nstudents in the class did everything they could to give\nthe instructor a hard time and make his job unpleasant.\nHow could he have handled it differently? If he had\nasked in a friendly way, \u201cWhose car is in the driveway?\u201d\nand then suggested that if it were moved, other cars\ncould get in and out, the student would have gladly\nmoved it and neither he nor his classmates would have\nbeen upset and resentful.\nAsking questions not only makes an order more palatable;\nit often stimulates the creativity of the persons\nwhom you ask. People are more likely to accept an order\nif they have had a part in the decision that caused the\norder to be issued.\nWhen Ian Macdonald of Johannesburg, South Africa,\nthe general manager of a small manufacturing plant specializing\nin precision machine parts, had the opportunity\nto accept a very large order, he was convinced that he\nwould not meet the promised delivery date. The work\nalready scheduled in the shop and the short completion\ntime needed for this order made it seem impossible for\nhim to accept the order.\nInstead of pushing his people to accelerate their work\nand rush the order through, he called everybody together,\nexplained the situation to them, and told them\nhow much it would mean to the company and to them if\nthey could make it possible to produce the order on\ntime. Then he started asking questions:\n\u201cIs there anything we can do to handle this order?\u201d\n\u201cCan anyone think of different ways to process it\nthrough the shop that will make it possible to take the\norder?\u201d\n\u201cIs there any way to adjust our hours or personnel\nassignments that would help?\u201d\nThe employees came up with many ideas and insisted\nthat he take the order. They approached it with a \u201cWe\ncan do it\u201d attitude, and the order was accepted, produced\nand delivered on time.\nAn effective leader will use . . .\nPRINCIPLE 4Ask questions instead of giving direct orders.LET THE OTHER PERSON SAVE FACE\nYears ago the General Electric Company was faced with\nthe delicate task of removing Charles Steinmetz from\nthe head of a department. Steinmetz, a genius of the first\nmagnitude when it came to electricity, was a failure as\nthe head of the calculating department. Yet the company\ndidn\u2019t dare offend the man. He was indispensable - and\nhighly sensitive. So they gave him a new title. They\nmade him Consulting Engineer of the General Electric\nCompany - a new title for work he was already doing -\nand let someone else head up the department.\nSteinmetz was happy.\nSo were the officers of G.E. They had gently maneuvered\ntheir most temperamental star, and they had done\nit without a storm - by letting him save face.\nLetting one save face! How important, how vitally important\nthat is! And how few of us ever stop to think of\nit! We ride roughshod over the feelings of others, getting\nour own way, finding fault, issuing threats, criticizing a\nchild or an employee in front of others, without even\nconsidering the hurt to the other person\u2019s pride.\nWhereas a few minutes\u2019 thought, a considerate word or\ntwo, a genuine understanding of the other person\u2019s attitude,\nwould go so far toward alleviating the sting!\nLet\u2019s remember that the next time we are faced with\nthe distasteful necessity of discharging or reprimanding\nan employee.\n\u201cFiring employees is not much fun. Getting fired is\neven less fun.\u201d (I\u2019m quoting now from a letter written\nme by Marshall A. Granger, a certified public accountant.)\n\u201cOur business is mostly seasonal. Therefore we\nhave to let a lot of people go after the income tax rush is\nover.\nIt\u2019s a byword in our profession that no one enjoys\nwielding the ax. Consequently, the custom has developed\nof getting it over as soon as possible, and usually\nin the following way: \u2018Sit down, Mr. Smith. The season\u2019s\nover, and we don\u2019t seem to see any more assignments for\nyou. Of course, you understood you were only employed\nfor the busy season anyhow, etc., etc.\u2019\n\u201cThe effect on these people is one of disappointment\nand a feeling of being \u2018let down.\u2019 Most of them are in the\naccounting field for life, and they retain no particular\nlove for the firm that drops them so casually.\n\u201cI recently decided to let our seasonal personnel go\nwith a little more tact and consideration. So I call each\none in only after carefully thinking over his or her work\nduring the winter. And I\u2019ve said something like this:\n\u2018Mr. Smith, you\u2019ve done a fine job (if he has). That time\nwe sent you to Newark, you had a tough assignment.\nYou were on the spot, but you came through with flying\ncolors, and we want you to know the firm is proud of\nyou. You\u2019ve got the stuff - you\u2019re going a long way,\nwherever you\u2019re working. This firm believes in you, and\nis rooting for you, and we don\u2019t want you to forget it.\u2019\n\u201cEffect? The people go away feeling a lot better about\nbeing fired. They don\u2019t feel \u2018let down.\u2019 They know if we\nhad work for them, we\u2019d keep them on. And when we\nneed them again, they come to us with a keen personal\naffection.\u201d\nAt one session of our course, two class members discussed\nthe negative effects of faultfinding versus the\npositive effects of letting the other person save face.\nFred Clark of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, told of an incident\nthat occurred in his company: \u201cAt one of our production\nmeetings, a vice president was asking very\npointed questions of one of our production supervisors\nregarding a production process. His tone of voice was\naggressive and aimed at pointing out faulty performance\non the part of the supervisor. Not wanting to be embarrassed\nin front of his peers, the supervisor was evasive\nin his responses. This caused the vice president to lose\nhis temper, berate the supervisor and accuse him of\nlying.\n\u201cAny working relationship that might have existed\nprior to this encounter was destroyed in a few brief moments.\nThis supervisor, who was basically a good\nworker, was useless to our company from that time on. A\nfew months later he left our firm and went to work for a\ncompetitor, where I understand he is doing a fine job.\u201d\nAnother class member, Anna Mazzone, related how a\nsimilar incident had occurred at her job - but what a\ndifference in approach and results! Ms. Mazzone, a marketing\nspecialist for a food packer, was given her first\nmajor assignment - the test-marketing of a new product.\nShe told the class: \u201cWhen the results of the test came in,\nI was devastated. I had made a serious error in my planning,\nand the entire test had to be done all over again.\nTo make this worse, I had no time to discuss it with my\nboss before the meeting in which I was to make my\nreport on the project.\n\u201cWhen I was called on to give the report, I was shaking\nwith fright. I had all I could do to keep from breaking\ndown, but I resolved I would not cry and have all those\nmen make remarks about women not being able to handle\na management job because they are too emotional. I\nmade my report briefly and stated that due to an error I\nwould repeat the study before the next meeting. I sat\ndown, expecting my boss to blow up.\n\u201cInstead, he thanked me for my work and remarked\nthat it was not unusual for a person to make an error on\na new project and that he had confidence that the repeat\nsurvey would be accurate and meaningful to the company.\nHe Assured me, in front of all my colleagues, that\nhe had faith in me and I knew I had done my best, and\nthat my lack of experience, not my lack of ability, was\nthe reason for the failure.\nI left that meeting with my head in the air and\nwith the determination that I would never let that boss\nof mine down again.\u201d\nEven if we are right and the other person is definitely\nwrong, we only destroy ego by causing someone to lose\nface. The legendary French aviation pioneer and author\nAntoine de Saint-Exup\xe9ry wrote: "I have no right to say\nor do anything that diminishes a man in his own eyes.\nWhat matters is not what I think of him, but what he\nthinks of himself. Hurting a man in his dignity is a\ncrime.\u201d\nA real leader will always follow . . .\nPRINCIPLE 5 Let the other person save face.HOW TO SPUR PEOPLE ONTO SUCCESS\nPete Barlow was an old friend of mine. He had a dog-and-\npony act and spent his life traveling with circuses\nand vaudeville shows. I loved to watch Pete train new\ndogs for his act. I noticed that the moment a dog showed\nthe slightest improvement, Pete patted and praised\nhim and gave him meat and made a great to-do about\nit.\nThat\u2019s nothing new. Animal trainers have been using\nthat same technique for centuries.\nWhy, I wonder, don\u2019t we use the same common sense\nwhen trying to change people that we use when trying\nto change dogs? Why don\u2019t we use meat instead of a\nwhip? Why don\u2019t we use praise instead of condemnation?\nLet us praise even the slightest improvement. That\ninspires the other person to keep on improving.\nIn his book I Ain\u2019t Much, Baby-But I\u2019m All IGot,\nthe psychologist Jess Lair comments: \u201cPraise is like sunlight\nto the warm human spirit; we cannot flower and\ngrow without it. And yet, while most of us are only too\nready to apply to others the cold wind of criticism, we\nare somehow reluctant to give our fellow the warm sunshine\nof praise.\u201d *')),(0,o.kt)("ul",null,(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},'Jess Lair, I Ain\u2019t Much, Baby - But I\u2019m All I Got (Greenwich, Conn.:\nFawcett, 1976), p . 248.\nI can look back at my own life and see where a few\nwords of praise have sharply changed my entire future.\nCan\u2019t you say the same thing about your life? History is\nreplete with striking illustrations of the sheer witchery\nraise.\nFor example, many years ago a boy of ten was working\nin a factory in Naples, He longed to be a singer, but his\nfirst teacher discouraged him. \u201cYou can\u2019t sing,\u201d he said.\n"You haven\u2019t any voice at all. It sounds like the wind in\nthe shutters.\u201d\nBut his mother, a poor peasant woman, put her arms\nabout him and praised him and told him she knew he\ncould sing, she could already see an improvement, and\nshe went barefoot in order to save money to pay for his\nmusic lessons. That peasant mother\u2019s praise and encouragement\nchanged that boy\u2019s life. His name was Enrico\nCaruso, and he became the greatest and most\nfamous opera singer of his age.\nIn the early nineteenth century, a young man in London\naspired to be a writer. But everything seemed to be\nagainst him. He had never been able to attend school\nmore than four years. His father had been flung in jail\nbecause he couldn\u2019t pay his debts, and this young man\noften knew the pangs of hunger. Finally, he got a job\npasting labels on bottles of blacking in a rat-infested\nwarehouse, and he slept at night in a dismal attic room\nwith two other boys - guttersnipes from the slums of\nLondon. He had so little confidence in his ability to\nwrite that he sneaked out and mailed his first manuscript\nin the dead of night so nobody would laugh at him. Story\nafter story was refused. Finally the great day came when\none was accepted. True, he wasn\u2019t paid a shilling for it,\nbut one editor had praised him. One editor had given\nhim recognition. He was so thrilled that he wandered\naimlessly around the streets with tears rolling down his\ncheeks.\nThe praise, the recognition, that he received through\ngetting one story in print, changed his whole life, for if\nit hadn\u2019t been for that encouragement, he might have\nspent his entire life working in rat-infested factories.\nYou may have heard of that boy. His name was Charles\nDickens.\nAnother boy in London made his living as a clerk in a\ndry-goods store. He had to get up at five o\u2019clock, sweep\nout the store, and slave for fourteen hours a day. It was\nsheer drudgery and he despised it. After two years, he\ncould stand it no longer, so he got up one morning and,\nwithout waiting for breakfast, tramped fifteen miles to\ntalk to his mother, who was working as a housekeeper.\nHe was frantic. He pleaded with her. He wept. He\nswore he would kill himself if he had to remain in the\nshop any longer. Then he wrote a long, pathetic letter to\nhis old schoolmaster, declaring that he was heartbroken,\nthat he no longer wanted to live. His old schoolmaster\ngave him a little praise and assured him that he really\nwas very intelligent and fitted for finer things and offered\nhim a job as a teacher.\nThat praise changed the future of that boy and made a\nlasting impression on the history of English literature.\nFor that boy went on to write innumerable best-selling\nbooks and made over a million dollars with his pen.\nYou\u2019ve probably heard of him. His name: H. G. Wells.\nUse of praise instead of criticism is the basic concept\nof B. F. Skinner\u2019s teachings. This great contemporary\npsychologist has shown by experiments with animals\nand with humans that when criticism is minimized and\npraise emphasized, the good things people do will be\nreinforced and the poorer things will atrophy for lack of\nattention.\nJohn Ringelspaugh of Rocky Mount, North Carolina,\nused this in dealing with his children. It seemed that, as\nin so many families, mother and dad\u2019s chief form of communication\nwith the children was yelling at them. And,\nas in so many cases, the children became a little worse\nrather than better after each such session - and so did\nthe parents. There seemed to be no end in sight for this\nproblem.\nMr. Ringelspaugh determined to use some of the principles\nhe was learning in our course to solve this situation.\nHe reported: \u201cWe decided to try praise instead of\nharping on their faults. It wasn\u2019t easy when all we could\nsee were the negative things they were doing; it was\nreally tough to find things to praise. We managed to find\nsomething, and within the first day or two some of the\nreally upsetting things they were doing quit happening.\nThen some of their other faults began to disappear. They\nbegan capitalizing on the praise we were giving them.\nThey even began going out of their way to do things\nright. Neither of us could believe it. Of course, it didn\u2019t\nlast forever, but the norm reached after things leveled\noff was so much better. It was no longer necessary to\nreact the way we used to. The children were doing far\nmore right things than wrong ones.\u201d All of this was a\nresult of praising the slightest improvement in the children\nrather than condemning everything they did wrong.\nThis works on the job too. Keith Roper of Woodland\nHills, California, applied this principle to a situation in\nhis company. Some material came to him in his print\nshop which was of exceptionally high quality. The\nprinter who had done this job was a new employee who\nhad been having difficulty adjusting to the job. His supervisor\nwas upset about what he considered a negative\nattitude and was seriously thinking of terminating his\nservices.\nWhen Mr. Roper was informed of this situation, he\npersonally went over to the print shop and had a talk\nwith the young man. He told him how pleased he was\nwith the work he had just received and pointed out it\nwas the best work he had seen produced in that shop for\nsome time. He pointed out exactly why it was superior\nand how important the young man\u2019s contribution was to\nthe company,\nDo you think this affected that young printer\u2019s attitude\ntoward the company? Within days there was a complete\nturnabout. He told several of his co-workers about the\nconversation and how someone in the company really\nappreciated good work. And from that day on, he was a\nloyal and dedicated worker.\nWhat Mr. Roper did was not just flatter the young\nprinter and say \u201cYou\u2019re good.\u201d He specifically pointed\nout how his work was superior. Because he had singled\nout a specific accomplishment, rather than just making\ngeneral flattering remarks, his praise became much more\nmeaningful to the person to whom it was given. Everybody\nlikes to be praised, but when praise is specific, it\ncomes across as sincere - not something the other person\nmay be saying just to make one feel good.\nRemember, we all crave appreciation and recognition,\nand will do almost anything to get it. But nobody wants\ninsincerity. Nobody wants flattery.\nLet me repeat: The principles taught in this book will\nwork only when they come from the heart. I am not\nadvocating a bag of tricks. I am talking about a new way\nof life.\nTalk about changing people. If you and I will inspire\nthe people with whom we come in contact to a realization\nof the hidden treasures they possess, we can do far\nmore than change people. We can literally transform\nthem.\nExaggeration? Then listen to these sage words from\nWilliam James, one of the most distinguished psychologists\nand philosophers America has ever produced:\nCompared with what we ought to be, we are only half\nawake. We are making use of only a small part of our physical\nand mental resources. Stating the thing broadly, the\nhuman individual thus lives far within his limits. He possesses\npowers of various sorts which he habitually fails to use.\nYes, you who are reading these lines possess powers\nof various sorts which you habitually fail to use; and one\nof these powers you are probably not using to the fullest\nextent is your magic ability to praise people and inspire\nthem with a realization of their latent possibilities.\nAbilities wither under criticism; they blossom under\nencouragement.

Be \u201chearty in yourapprobation and lavish in your praise.\u201dGIVE A DOG A GOOD NAMEWhat do you do when a person who has been a good\nworker begins to turn in shoddy work? You can fire him\nor her, but that really doesn\u2019t solve anything. You can\nberate the worker, but this usually causes resentment.\nHenry Henke, a service manager for a large truck dealership\nin Lowell, Indiana, had a mechanic whose\nwork had become less than satisfactory. Instead of\nbawling him out or threatening him, Mr. Henke called\nhim into his office and had a heart-to-heart talk with\nhim.\n\u201cBill,\u201d he said, \u201cyou are a fine mechanic. You have\nbeen in this line of work for a good number of years. You\nhave repaired many vehicles to the customers\u2019 satisfaction.\nIn fact, we\u2019ve had a number of compliments about\nthe good work you have done. Yet, of late, the time you\ntake to complete each job has been increasing and your\nwork has not been up to your own old standards. Because\nyou have been such an outstanding mechanic in\nthe past, I felt sure you would want to know that I am\nnot happy with this situation, and perhaps jointly we\ncould find some way to correct the problem.\u201d\nBill responded that he hadn\u2019t realized he had been\nfalling down in his duties and assured his boss that the\nwork he was getting was not out of his range of expertise\nand he would try to improve in the future.\nDid he do it? You can be sure he did. He once again\nbecame a fast and thorough mechanic. With that reputation\nMr. Henke had given him to live up to, how could\nhe do anything else but turn out work comparable to that\nwhich he had done in the past.\n\u201cThe average person,\u201d said Samuel Vauclain, then\npresident of the Baldwin Locomotive Works, "can be\nled readily if you have his or her respect and if you show\nthat you respect that person for some kind of ability.\u201d\nIn short, if you want to improve a person in a certain\nspect, act as though that particular trait were already\none of his or her outstanding characteristics. Shakespeare\nsaid \u201cAssume a virtue, if you have it not.\u201d And it\nmight be well to assume and state openly that other people\nhave the virtue you want them to develop. Give\nthem a fine reputation to live up to, and they will make\nprodigious efforts rather than see you disillusioned.\nGeorgette Leblanc, in her book Souvenirs, My Life\nwith Maeterlinck, describes the startling transformation\nof a humble Belgian Cinderella.\n\u201cA servant girl from a neighboring hotel brought my\nmeals,\u201d she wrote. \u201cShe was called \u2018Marie the Dish\nwasher\u2019 because she had started her career as a scullery\nassistant. She was a kind of monster, cross-eyed, bandylegged,\npoor in flesh and spirit.\n\u201cOne day, while she was holding my plate of macaroni\nin her red hand, I said to her point-blank, \u2018Marie, you do\nnot know what treasures are within you.\u2019\n\u201cAccustomed to holding back her emotion, Marie\nwaited a few moments, not daring to risk the slightest\ngesture for fear of a castastrophe. Then she put the dish\non the table, sighed and said ingenuously, \u2018Madame, I\nwould never have believed it.\u2019 She did not doubt, she\ndid not ask a question. She simply went back to the\nkitchen and repeated what I had said, and such is the\nforce of faith that no one made fun of her. From that day\non, she was even given a certain consideration. But the\nmost curious change of all occurred in the humble Marie\nherself. Believing she was the tabernacle of unseen marvels, she began taking care of her face and body so carefully that her starved youth seemed to bloom and\nmodestly hide her plainness.\n\u201cTwo months later, she announced her coming marriage\nwith the nephew of the chef. \u2018I\u2019m going to be a\nlady,\u2019 she said, and thanked me. A small phrase had\nchanged her entire life.\u201d\nGeorgette Leblanc had given \u201cMarie the Dishwasher\u201d\na reputation to live up to - and that reputation had transformed\nher.\nBill Parker, a sales representative for a food company\nin Daytona Beach, Florida, was very excited about the\nnew line of products his company was introducing and\nwas upset when the manager of a large independent\nfood market turned down the opportunity to carry it in\nhis store. Bill brooded all day over this rejection and\ndecided to return to the store before he went home that\nevening and try again.\n\u201cJack,\u201d he said, \u201csince I left this morning I realized I\nhadn\u2019t given you the entire picture of our new line, and\nI would appreciate some of your time to tell you about\nthe points I omitted. I have respected the fact that you\nare always willing to listen and are big enough to change\nyour mind when the facts warrant a change.\u201d\nCould Jack refuse to give him another hearing? Not\nwith that reputation to live up to.\nOne morning Dr. Martin Fitzhugh, a dentist in Dublin,\nIreland, was shocked when one of his patients\npointed out to him that the metal cup holder which she\nwas using to rinse her mouth was not very clean. True,\nthe patient drank from the paper cup, not the holder, but\nit certainly was not professional to use tarnished equipment.\nWhen the patient left, Dr. Fitzhugh retreated to his\nprivate office to write a note to Bridgit, the charwoman,\nwho came twice a week to clean his office. He wrote:\nMy dear Bridgit,\nI see you so seldom, I thought I\u2019d take the time to thank\nyou for the fine job of cleaning you\u2019ve been doing. By the\nway, I thought I\u2019d mention that since two hours, twice a\nweek, is a very limited amount of time, please feel free to\nwork an extra half hour from time to time if you feel you\nneed to do those \u201conce-in-a-while\u201d things like polishing\nthe cup holders and the like. I, of course, will pay you for\nthe extra time.\n\u201cThe next day, when I walked into my office,\u201d Dr.\nFitzhugh reported, "My desk had been polished to a\nmirror-like finish, as had my chair, which I nearly slid\nout of. When I went into the treatment room I found the\nshiniest, cleanest chrome-plated cup holder I had ever\nseen nestled in its receptacle. I had given my char-woman\na fine reputation to live up to, and because of\nthis small gesture she outperformed all her past efforts.\nHow much additional time did she spend on this?

In her class this year she\nwould have Tommy T., the school\u2019s most notorious \u201cbad\nboy.\u201d His third-grade teacher had constantly complained\nabout Tommy to colleagues, the principal and\nanyone else who would listen. He was not just mischievous;\nhe caused serious discipline problems in the class,\npicked fights with the boys, teased the girls, was fresh to\nthe teacher, and seemed to get worse as he grew older.\nHis only redeeming feature was his ability to learn rapidly\nand master the-school work easily.\nMrs. Hopkins decided to face the \u201cTommy problem\u201d\nimmediately. When she greeted her new students, she\nmade little comments to each of them: \u201cRose, that\u2019s a\npretty dress you are wearing,\u201d \u201cAlicia, I hear you draw\nbeautifully.\u201d When she came to Tommy, she looked him\nstraight in the eyes and said, \u201cTommy, I understand you\nare a natural leader.

The first teacher I engaged probably told me\nthe truth. She said I was all wrong; I would just have to\nforget everything and begin all over again. But that took\nthe heart out of me. I had no incentive to go on. So I quit\nher.\n\u201cThe next teacher may have been lying, but I liked it.\nShe said nonchalantly that my dancing was a bit old-fashioned\nperhaps, but the fundamentals were all right,\nand she assured me I wouldn\u2019t have any trouble learning\na few new steps. The first teacher had discouraged me\nby emphasizing my mistakes. This new teacher did the\nopposite. She kept praising the things I did right and\nminimizing my errors. \u2018You have a natural sense of\nrhythm,\u2019 she assured me. \u2018You really are a natural-born\ndancer.\u2019 Now my common sense tells me that I always\nhave been and always will be a fourth-rate dancer; yet,\ndeep in my heart, I still like to think that maybe she\nmeant it. To be sure, I was paying her to say it; but why\nbring that up?\n\u201cAt any rate, I know I am a better dancer than I would\nhave been if she hadn\u2019t told me I had a natural sense of\nrhythm. That encouraged me. That gave me hope. That\nmade me want to improve.\u201d\nTell your child, your spouse, or your employee that he\nor she is stupid or dumb at a certain thing, has no gift for\nit, and is doing it all wrong, and you have destroyed\nalmost every incentive to try to improve. But use the\nopposite technique - be liberal with your encouragement,\nmake the thing seem easy to do, let the other person\nknow that you have faith in his ability to do it, that\nhe has an undeveloped flair for it - and he will practice\nuntil the dawn comes in the window in order to excel.\nLowell Thomas, a superb artist in human relations,\nused this technique, He gave you confidence, inspired\nyou with courage and faith. For example, I spent a weekend\nwith Mr. and Mrs. Thomas; and on Saturday night,\nI was asked to sit in on a friendly bridge game before a\nroaring fire. Bridge? Oh, no! No! No! Not me. I knew\nnothing about it. The game had always been a black\nmystery to me, No! No! Impossible!\n\u201cWhy, Dale, it is no trick at all,\u201d Lowell replied.\n\u201cThere is nothing to bridge except memory and judgment.\nYou\u2019ve written articles on memory. Bridge will be\na cinch for you. It\u2019s right up your alley.\u201d\nAnd presto, almost before I realized what I was doing,\nI found myself for the first time at a bridge table. All\nbecause I was told I had a natural flair for it and the\ngame was made to seem easy.\nSpeaking of bridge reminds me of Ely Culbertson,\nwhose books on bridge have been translated into a\ndozen languages and have sold more than a million copies.\nYet he told me he never would have made a profession\nout of the game if a certain young woman hadn\u2019t\nassured him he had a flair for it.\nWhen he came to America in 1922, he tried to get a job\nteaching in philosophy and sociology, but he couldn\u2019t.\nThen he tried selling coal, and he failed at that\nThen he tried selling coffee, and he failed at that, too.\nHe had played some bridge, but it had never occurred\nto him in those days that someday he would teach it. He\nwas not only a poor card player, but he was also very\nstubborn. He asked so many questions and held so many\npost-mortem examinations that no one wanted to play\nwith him.\nThen he met a pretty bridge teacher, Josephine Dillon,\nfell in love and married her. She noticed how carefully\nhe analyzed his cards and persuaded him that he\nwas a potential genius at the card table. It was that encouragement\nand that alone, Culbertson told me, that\ncaused him to make a profession of bridge.\nClarence M. Jones, one of the instructors of our course\nin Cincinnati, Ohio, told how encouragement and making\nfaults seem easy to correct completely changed the\nlife of his son.\n\u201cIn 1970 my son David, who was then fifteen years\nold, came to live with me in Cincinnati. He had led a\nrough life. In 1958 his head was cut open in a car accident,\nleaving a very bad scar on his forehead. In 1960\nhis mother and I were divorced and he moved to Dallas,\nTexas, with his mother. Until he was fifteen he had spent\nmost of his school years in special classes for slow learners\nin the Dallas school system. Possibly because of the\nscar, school administrators had decided he was brain-injured\nand could not function at a normal level. He was\ntwo years behind his age group, so he was only in the\nseventh grade. Yet he did not know his multiplication\ntables, added on his fingers and could barely read.\n\u201cThere was one positive point. He loved to work on\nradio and TV sets. He wanted to become a TV technician.\nI encouraged this and pointed out that he needed\nmath to qualify for the training. I decided to help him\nbecome proficient in this subject. We obtained four sets\nof flash cards: multiplication, division, addition and subtraction.\nAs we went through the cards, we put the correct\nanswers in a discard stack. When David missed one,\nI gave him the correct answer and then put the card in\nthe repeat stack until there were no cards left. I made a\nbig deal out of each card he got right, particularly if he\nhad missed it previously. Each night we would go\nthrough the repeat stack until there were no cards left.\nEach night we timed the exercise with a stop watch. I\npromised him that when he could get all the cards correct\nin eight minutes with no incorrect answers, we\nwould quit doing it every night. This seemed an impossible\ngoal to David. The first night it took 52 minutes,\nthe second night, 48, then 45, 44, 41 then under 40 minutes.\nWe celebrated each reduction. I\u2019d call in my wife,\nand we would both hug him and we\u2019d all dance a jig. At\nthe end of the month he was doing all the cards perfectly\nin less than eight minutes. When he made a small improvement\nhe would ask to do it again. He had made the\nfantastic discovery that learning was easy and fun.\n\u201cNaturally his grades in algebra took a jump. It is\namazing how much easier algebra is when you can multiply.\nHe astonished himself by bringing home a B in\nmath. That had never happened before. Other changes\ncame with almost unbelievable rapidity. His reading improved\nrapidly, and he began to use his natural talents\nin drawing. Later in the school year his science teacher\nassigned him to develop an exhibit. He chose to develop\na highly complex series of models to demonstrate the\neffect of levers. It required skill not only in drawing and\nmodel making but in applied mathematics. The exhibit\ntook first prize in his school\u2019s science fair and was entered\nin the city competition and won third prize for the\nentire city of Cincinnati.\n\u201cThat did it. Here was a kid who had flunked two\ngrades, who had been told he was \u2018brain-damaged,\u2019 who\nhad been called \u2018Frankenstein\u2019 by his classmates and\ntold his brains must have leaked out of the cut on his\nhead. Suddenly he discovered he could really learn and\naccomplish things. The result? From the last quarter of\nthe eighth grade all the way through high school, he\nnever failed to make the honor roll; in high school he\nwas elected to the national honor society. Once he found\nlearning was easy, his whole life changed.\u201d\nIf you want to help others to improve, remember . . .\nPRINCIPLE 8Use encouragement. Make the fault seemeasy to correct.\nMAKING PEOPLE GLAD TO DOWHAT YOU WANTBack in 1915, America was aghast. For more than a year,\nthe nations of Europe had been slaughtering one another\non a scale never before dreamed of in all the\nbloody annals of mankind. Could peace be brought\nabout? No one knew. But Woodrow Wilson was determined\nto try. He would send a personal representative,\na peace emissary, to counsel with the warlords of Europe.\nWilliam Jennings Bryan, secretary of state, Bryan, the\npeace advocate, longed to go. He saw a chance to perform\na great service and make his name immortal. But\nWilson appointed another man, his intimate friend and\nadvisor Colonel Edward M. House; and it was House\u2019s\nthorny task to break the unwelcome news to Bryan without\ngiving him offense.\n\u201cBryan was distinctly disappointed when he heard I\nwas to go to Europe as the peace emissary,\u201d Colonel\nHouse records in his diary. \u201cHe said he had planned to\ndo this himself . . .\n"I replied that the President thought it would be unwise\nfor anyone to do this officially, and that his going\nwould attract a great deal of attention and people\nwould wonder why he was there. . . ."\nYou see the intimation? House practically told Bryan\nthat he was too important for the job - and Bryan was\nsatisfied.\nColonel House, adroit, experienced in the ways of the\nworld, was following one of the important rules of\nhuman relations: Always make the other person happy\nabout doing the thing you suggest.\nWoodrow Wilson followed that policy even when inviting\nWilliam Gibbs McAdoo to become a member of\nhis cabinet. That was the highest honor he could confer\nupon anyone, and yet Wilson extended the invitation in\nsuch a way as to make McAdoo feel doubly important.\nHere is the story in McAdoo\'s own words: \u201cHe ',"[Wilson]","\nsaid that he was making up his cabinet and that he would\nbe very glad if I would accept a place in it as Secretary\nof the Treasury. He had a delightful way of putting\nthings; he created the impression that by accepting this\ngreat honor I would be doing him a favor.\u201d\nUnfortunately, Wilson didn\u2019t always employ such taut.\nIf he had, history might have been different. For example,\nWilson didn\u2019t make the Senate and the Republican\nParty happy by entering the United States in the League\nof Nations. Wilson refused to take such prominent Republican\nleaders as Elihu Root or Charles Evans Hughes\nor Henry Cabot Lodge to the peace conference with\nhim. Instead, he took along unknown men from his own\nparty. He snubbed the Republicans, refused to let them\nfeel that the League was their idea as well as his, refused\nto let them have a finger in the pie; and, as a result of\nthis crude handling of human relations, wrecked his own\ncareer, ruined his health, shortened his life, caused\nAmerica to stay out of the League, and altered the history\nof the world.\nStatesmen and diplomats aren\u2019t the only ones who use\nthis make-a-person-happy-yo-do-things-you-want-them-to-\ndo approach. Dale O. Ferrier of Fort Wayne, Indiana,\ntold how he encouraged one of his young children to\nwillingly do the chore he was assigned.\n\u201cOne of Jeff\u2019s chores was to pick up pears from under\nthe pear tree so the person who was mowing underneath\nwouldn\u2019t have to stop to pick them up. He didn\u2019t like\nthis chore, and frequently it was either not done at all or\nit was done so poorly that the mower had to stop and\npick up several pears that he had missed. Rather than\nhave an eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation about it, one\nday I said to him: \u2018Jeff, I\u2019ll make a deal with you. For\nevery bushel basket full of pears you pick up, I\u2019ll pay\nyou one dollar. But after you are finished, for every pear\nI find left in the yard, I\u2019ll take away a dollar. How does\nthat sound?\u2019 As you would expect, he not only picked up\nall of the pears, but I had to keep an eye on him to see\nthat he didn\u2019t pull a few off the trees to fill up some of\nthe baskets.\u201d\nI knew a man who had to refuse many invitations to\nspeak, invitations extended by friends, invitations coming\nfrom people to whom he was obligated; and yet he\ndid it so adroitly that the other person was at least contented\nwith his refusal. How did he do it? Not by merely\ntalking about the fact that he was too busy and too-this\nand too-that. No, after expressing his appreciation of the\ninvitation and regretting his inability to accept it, he suggested\na substitute speaker. In other words, he didn\u2019t\ngive the other person any time to feel unhappy about the\nrefusal, He immediately changed the other person\u2019s\nthoughts to some other speaker who could accept the\ninvitation.\nGunter Schmidt, who took our course in West Germany,\ntold of an employee in the food store he managed\nwho was negligent about putting the proper price tags\non the shelves where the items were displayed. This\ncaused confusion and customer complaints. Reminders,\nadmonitions, confrontations, with her about this did not\ndo much good. Finally, Mr. Schmidt called her into his\noffice and told her he was appointing her Supervisor of\nPrice Tag Posting for the entire store and she would be\nresponsible for keeping all of the shelves properly\ntagged. This new responsibility and title changed her\nattitude completely, and she fulfiled her duties satisfactorily\nfrom then on.\nChildish? Perhaps. But that is what they said to Napoleon\nwhen he created the Legion of Honor and distributed\n15,000 crosses to his soldiers and made\neighteen of his generals \u201cMarshals of France\u201d and called\nhis troops the \u201cGrand Army.\u201d Napoleon was criticized\nfor giving \u201ctoys\u201d to war-hardened veterans, and Napoleon\nreplied, \u201cMen are ruled by toys.\u201d\nThis technique of giving titles and authority worked\nfor Napoleon and it will work for you. For example, a\nfriend of mine, Mrs. Ernest Gent of Scarsdale, New\nYork, was troubled by boys running across and destroying\nher lawn. She tried criticism. She tried coaxing. Neither\nworked. Then she tried giving the worst sinner in\nthe gang a title and a feeling of authority. She made him\nher \u201cdetective\u201d and put him in charge of keeping all\ntrespassers off her lawn. That solved her problem. Her\n\u201cdetective\u201d built a bonfire in the backyard, heated an\niron red hot, and threatened to brand any boy who\nstepped on the lawn.\nThe effective leader should keep the following guidelines\nin mind when it is necessary to change attitudes or\nbehavior:")),(0,o.kt)("ol",null,(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Be sincere.

It is reprinted\nin this edition to give the readers additional\nbackground on Dale Carnegie.\nIt was a cold January night in 1935, but the weather\ncouldn\u2019t keep them away. Two thousand five hundred\nmen and women thronged into the grand ballroom of the\nHotel Pennsylvania in New York. Every available seat\nwas filled by half-past seven. At eight o\u2019clock, the eager\ncrowd was still pouring in. The spacious balcony was\nsoon jammed. Presently even standing space was at a\npremium, and hundreds of people, tired after navigating\na day in business, stood up for an hour and a half that\nnight to witness - what?\nA fashion show?\nA six-day bicycle race or a personal appearance by\nClark Gable?\nNo. These people had been lured there by a newspaper\nad. Two evenings previously, they had seen this\nfull-page announcement in the New York Sunstaring\nthem in the face:\nLearn to Speak Effectively\nPrepare for Leadership\nOld stuff? Yes, but believe it or not, in the most sophisticated\ntown on earth, during a depression with 20\npercent of the population on relief, twenty-five hundred\npeople had left their homes and hustled to the hotel in\nresponse to that ad.\nThe people who responded were of the upper economic\nstrata - executives, employers and professionals.\nThese men and women had come to hear the opening\ngun of an ultramodern, ultrapractical course in \u201cEffective\nSpeaking and Influencing Men in Business\u201d- a\ncourse given by the Dale Carnegie Institute of Effective\nSpeaking and Human Relations.\nWhy were they there, these twenty-five hundred business\nmen and women?\nBecause of a sudden hunger for more education because\nof the depression?\nApparently not, for this same course had been playing\nto packed houses in New York City every season for the\npreceding twenty-four years. During that time, more\nthan fifteen thousand business and professional people\nhad been trained by Dale Carnegie. Even large, skeptical,\nconservative organizations such as the Westinghouse\nElectric Company, the McGraw-Hill Publishing\nCompany, the Brooklyn Union Gas Company, the\nBrooklyn Chamber of Commerce, the American Institute\nof Electrical Engineers and the New York Telephone\nCompany have had this training conducted in\ntheir own offices for the benefit of their members and\nexecutives.\nThe fact that these people, ten or twenty years after\nleaving grade school, high school or college, come and\ntake this training is a glaring commentary on the shocking\ndeficiencies of our educational system.\nWhat do adults really want to study?That is an important\nquestion; and in order to answer it, the University\nof Chicago, the American Association for Adult Education,\nand the United Y.M.C.A. Schools made a survey\nover a two-year period.\nThat survey revealed that the prime interest of adults\nis health. It also revealed that their second interest is in\ndeveloping skill in human relationships - they want to\nlearn the technique of getting along with and influencing\nother people. They don\u2019t want to become public\nspeakers, and they don\u2019t want to listen to a lot of high\nsounding talk about psychology; they want suggestions\nthey can use immediately in business, in social contacts\nand in the home.\nSo that was what adults wanted to study, was it?\n\u201cAll right,\u201d said the people making the survey. "Fine.\nIf that is what they want, we\u2019ll give it to them.\u201d\nLooking around for a textbook, they discovered that\nno working manual had ever been written to help people\nsolve their daily problems in human relationships.\nHere was a fine kettle of fish! For hundreds of years,\nlearned volumes had been written on Greek and Latin\nand higher mathematics - topics about which the average\nadult doesn\u2019t give two hoots. But on the one subject\non which he has a thirst for knowledge, a veritable passion\nfor guidance and help - nothing!\nThis explained the presence of twenty-five hundred\neager adults crowding into the grand ballroom of the\nHotel Pennsylvania in response to a newspaper advertisement.\nHere, apparently, at last was the thing for\nwhich they had long been seeking.\nBack in high school and college, they had pored over\nbooks, believing that knowledge alone was the open sesame\nto financial - and professional rewards.\nBut a few years in the rough-and-tumble of business\nand professional life had brought sharp dissillusionment.\nThey had seen some of the most important business\nsuccesses won by men who possessed, in addition\nto their knowledge, the ability to talk well, to win people\nto their way of thinking, and to "sell" themselves and\ntheir ideas.\nThey soon discovered that if one aspired to wear the\ncaptain\u2019s cap and navigate the ship of business, personality\nand the ability to talk are more important than a\nknowledge of Latin verbs or a sheepskin from Harvard.\nThe advertisement in the New York Sun promised that\nthe meeting would be highly entertaining. It was.\nEighteen people who had taken the course were marshaled\nin front of the loudspeaker - and fifteen of them\nwere given precisely seventy-five seconds each to tell\nhis or her story. Only seventy-five seconds of talk, then\n\u201cbang\u201d went the gavel, and the chairman shouted,\n\u201cTime! Next speaker!\u201d\nThe affair moved with the speed of a herd of buffalo\nthundering across the plains. Spectators stood for an\nhour and a half to watch the performance.\nThe speakers were a cross section of life: several sales\nrepresentatives, a chain store executive, a baker, the\npresident of a trade association, two bankers, an insurance\nagent, an accountant, a dentist, an architect, a druggist\nwho had come from Indianapolis to New York to\ntake the course, a lawyer who had come from Havana in\norder to prepare himself to give one important three-minute\nspeech.\nThe first speaker bore the Gaelic name Patrick J.\nO\'Haire. Born in Ireland, he attended school for only\nfour years, drifted to America, worked as a mechanic,\nthen as a chauffeur.\nNow, however, he was forty, he had a growing family\nand needed more money, so he tried selling trucks. Suffering\nfrom an inferiority complex that, as he put it, was\neating his heart out, he had to walk up and down in front\nof an office half a dozen times before he could summon\nup enough courage to open the door. He was so discouraged\nas a salesman that he was thinking of going back to\nworking with his hands in a machine shop, when one\nday he received a letter inviting him to an organization\nmeeting of the Dale Carnegie Course in Effective\nSpeaking.\nHe didn\u2019t want to attend. He feared he would have to\nassociate with a lot of college graduates, that he would\nbe out of place.\nHis despairing wife insisted that he go, saying, \u201cIt\nmay do you some good, Pat. God knows you need it.\u201d\nHe went down to the place where the meeting was to be\nheld and stood on the sidewalk for five minutes before\nhe could generate enough self-confidence to enter the\nroom.\nThe first few times he tried to speak in front of the\nothers, he was dizzy with fear. But as the weeks drifted\nby, he lost all fear of audiences and soon found that he\nloved to talk - the bigger the crowd, the better. And he\nalso lost his fear of individuals and of his superiors. He\npresented his ideas to them, and soon he had been advanced\ninto the sales department. He had become a valued\nand much liked member of his company. This night,\nin the Hotel Pennsylvania, Patrick O\'Haire stood in front\nof twenty-five hundred people and told a gay, rollicking\nstory of his achievements. Wave after wave of laughter\nswept over the audience. Few professional speakers\ncould have equaled his performance.\nThe next speaker, Godfrey Meyer, was a gray-headed\nbanker, the father of eleven children. The first time he\nhad attempted to speak in class, he was literally struck\ndumb. His mind refused to function. His story is a vivid\nillustration of how leadership gravitates to the person\nwho can talk.\nHe worked on Wall Street, and for twenty-five years\nhe had been living in Clifton, New Jersey. During that\ntime, he had taken no active part in community affairs\nand knew perhaps five hundred people.\nShortly after he had enrolled in the Carnegie course,\nhe received his tax bill and was infuriated by what he\nconsidered unjust charges. Ordinarily, he would have\nsat at home and fumed, or he would have taken it out in\ngrousing to his neighbors. But instead, he put on his hat\nthat night, walked into the town meeting, and blew off\nsteam in public.\nAs a result of that talk of indignation, the citizens of\nClifton, New Jersey, urged him to run for the town council.\nSo for weeks he went from one meeting to another,\ndenouncing waste and municipal extravagance.\nThere were ninety-six candidates in the field. When\nthe ballots were counted, lo, Godfrey Meyer\u2019s name led\nall the rest. Almost overnight, he had become a public\nfigure among the forty thousand people in his community.\nAs a result of his talks, he made eighty times more\nfriends in six weeks than he had been able to previously\nin twenty-five years.\nAnd his salary as councilman meant that he got a return\nof 1,000 percent a year on his investment in the\nCarnegie course.\nThe third speaker, the head of a large national association\nof food manufacturers, told how he had been unable\nto stand up and express his ideas at meetings of a\nboard of directors.\nAs a result of learning to think on his feet, two astonishing\nthings happened. He was soon made president of\nhis association, and in that capacity, he was obliged to\naddress meetings all over the United States. Excerpts\nfrom his talks were put on the Associated Press wires\nand printed in newspapers and trade magazines\nthroughout the country.\nIn two years, after learning to speak more effectively,\nhe received more free publicity for his company and its\nproducts than he had been able to get previously with a\nquarter of a million dollars spent in direct advertising.\nThis speaker admitted that he had formerly hesitated to\ntelephone some of the more important business executives\nin Manhattan and invite them to lunch with him.\nBut as a result of the prestige he had acquired by his\ntalks, these same people telephoned him and invited\nhim to lunch and apologized to him for encroaching on\nhis time.\nThe ability to speak is a shortcut to distinction. It puts\na person in the limelight, raises one head and shoulders\nabove the crowd. And the person who can speak acceptably\nis usually given credit for an ability out of all proportion\nto what he or she really possesses.\nA movement for adult education has been sweeping\nover the nation; and the most spectacular force in that\nmovement was Dale Carnegie, a man who listened to\nand critiqued more talks by adults than has any other\nman in captivity. According to a cartoon by "Believe-It-or-\nNot\u201d Ripley, he had criticized 150,000 speeches. If\nthat grand total doesn\u2019t impress you, remember that it\nmeant one talk for almost every day that has passed since\nColumbus discovered America. Or, to put it in other\nwords, if all the people who had spoken before him had\nused only three minutes and had appeared before him\nin succession, it would have taken ten months, listening\nday and night, to hear them all.\nDale Carnegie\u2019s own career, filled with sharp contrasts,\nwas a striking example of what a person can accomplish\nwhen obsessed with an original idea and afire\nwith enthusiasm.\nBorn on a Missouri farm ten miles from a railway, he\nnever saw a streetcar until he was twelve years old; yet\nby the time he was forty-six, he was familiar with the far-flung\ncorners of the earth, everywhere from Hong Kong\nto Hammerfest; and, at one time, he approached closer\nto the North Pole than Admiral Byrd\u2019s headquarters at\nLittle America was to the South Pole.\nThis Missouri lad who had once picked strawberries\nand cut cockleburs for five cents an hour became the\nhighly paid trainer of the executives of large corporations\nin the art of self-expression.\nThis erstwhile cowboy who had once punched cattle\nand branded calves and ridden fences out in western\nSouth Dakota later went to London to put on shows\nunder the patronage of the royal family.\nThis chap who was a total failure the first half-dozen\ntimes he tried to speak in public later became my personal\nmanager. Much of my success has been due to\ntraining under Dale Carnegie.\nYoung Carnegie had to struggle for an education, for\nhard luck was always battering away at the old farm in\nnorthwest Missouri with a flying tackle and a body slam.\nYear after year, the \u201c102\u201d River rose and drowned the\ncorn and swept away the hay. Season after season, the\nfat hogs sickened and died from cholera, the bottom fell\nout of the market for cattle and mules, and the bank\nthreatened to foreclose the mortgage.\nSick with discouragement, the family sold out and\nbought another farm near the State Teachers\u2019 College at\nWarrensburg, Missouri. Board and room could be had in\ntown for a dollar a day, but young Carnegie couldn\u2019t\nafford it. So he stayed on the farm and commuted on\nhorseback three miles to college each day. At home, he\nmilked the cows, cut the wood, fed the hogs, and studied\nhis Latin verbs by the light of a coal-oil lamp until his\neyes blurred and he began to nod.\nEven when he got to bed at midnight, he set the alarm\nfor three o\u2019clock. His father bred pedigreed Duroc-Jersey\nhogs - and there was danger, during the bitter\ncold nights, that the young pigs would freeze to death;\nso they were put in a basket, covered with a gunny sack,\nand set behind the kitchen stove. True to their nature,\nthe pigs demanded a hot meal at 3 A.M. So when the\nalarm went off, Dale Carnegie crawled out of the blankets,\ntook the basket of pigs out to their mother, waited\nfor them to nurse, and then brought them back to the\nwarmth of the kitchen stove.\nThere were six hundred students in State Teachers\u2019\nCollege, and Dale Carnegie was one of the isolated half-dozen\nwho couldn\u2019t afford to board in town. He was\nashamed of the poverty that made it necessary for him to\nride back to the farm and milk the cows every night. He\nwas ashamed of his coat, which was too tight, and his\ntrousers, which were too short. Rapidly developing an\ninferiority complex, he looked about for some shortcut\nto distinction. He soon saw that there were certain\ngroups in college that enjoyed influence and prestige - the\nfootball and baseball players and the chaps who won\nthe debating and public-speaking contests.\nRealizing that he had no flair for athletics, he decided\nto win one of the speaking contests. He spent months\npreparing his talks. He practiced as he sat in the saddle\ngalloping to college and back; he practiced his speeches\nas he milked the cows; and then he mounted a bale of\nhay in the barn and with great gusto and gestures harangued\nthe frightened pigeons about the issues of the\nday.\nBut in spite of all his earnestness and preparation, he\nmet with defeat after defeat. He was eighteen at the time'),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},'sensitive and proud. He became so discouraged, so\ndepressed, that he even thought of suicide. And then\nsuddenly he began to win, not one contest, but every\nspeaking contest in college.\nOther students pleaded with him to train them; and\nthey won also.\nAfter graduating from college, he started selling\ncorrespondence courses to the ranchers among the sand\nhills of western Nebraska and eastern Wyoming. In spite\nof all his boundless energy and enthusiasm, he couldn\u2019t\nmake the grade. He became so discouraged that he went\nto his hotel room in Alliance, Nebraska, in the middle of\nthe day, threw himself across the bed, and wept in despair.\nHe longed to go back to college, he longed to\nretreat from the harsh battle of life; but he couldn\u2019t. So\nhe resolved to go to Omaha and get another job. He\ndidn\u2019t have the money for a railroad ticket, so he traveled\non a freight train, feeding and watering two carloads of\nwild horses in return for his passage, After landing in\nsouth Omaha, he got a job selling bacon and soap and\nlard for Armour and Company. His territory was up\namong the Badlands and the cow and Indian country of\nwestern South Dakota. He covered his territory by\nfreight train and stage coach and horseback and slept in\npioneer hotels where the only partition between the\nrooms was a sheet of muslin. He studied books on salesmanship,\nrode bucking bronchos, played poker with the\nIndians, and learned how to collect money. And when,\nfor example, an inland storekeeper couldn\u2019t pay cash for\nthe bacon and hams he had ordered, Dale Carnegie\nwould take a dozen pairs of shoes off his shelf, sell the\nshoes to the railroad men, and forward the receipts to\nArmour and Company.\nHe would often ride a freight train a hundred miles a\nday. When the train stopped to unload freight, he would\ndash uptown, see three or four merchants, get his orders;\nand when the whistle blew, he would dash down the\nstreet again lickety-split and swing onto the train while\nit was moving.\nWithin two years, he had taken an unproductive territory\nthat had stood in the twenty-fifth place and had\nboosted it to first place among all the twenty-nine car\nroutes leading out of south Omaha. Armour and Company\noffered to promote him, saying: \u201cYou have\nachieved what seemed impossible.\u201d But he refused the\npromotion and resigned, went to New York, studied at\nthe American Academy of Dramatic Arts, and toured the\ncountry, playing the role of Dr. Hartley in Polly of the\nCircus.\nHe would never be a Booth or a Barrymore. He had\nthe good sense to recognize that, So back he went to\nsales work, selling automobiles and trucks for the Packard\nMotor Car Company.\nHe knew nothing about machinery and cared nothing\nabout it. Dreadfully unhappy, he had to scourge himself\nto his task each day. He longed to have time to study, to\nwrite the books he had dreamed about writing back in\ncollege. So he resigned. He was going to spend his days\nwriting stories and novels and support himself by teaching\nin a night school.\nTeaching what? As he looked back and evaluated his\ncollege work, he saw that his training in public speaking\nhad done more to give him confidence, courage, poise\nand the ability to meet and deal with people in business\nthan had all the rest of his college courses put together,\nSo he urged the Y.M.C.A. schools in New York to give\nhim a chance to conduct courses in public speaking for\npeople in business.\nWhat? Make orators out of business people? Absurd.\nThe Y.M.C.A. people knew. They had tried such courses\n-and they had always failed. When they refused to pay\nhim a salary of two dollars a night, he agreed to teach on\na commission basis and take a percentage of the net profits\n-if there were any profits to take. And inside of three\nyears they were paying him thirty dollars a night on that\nbasis - instead of two.\nThe course grew. Other "Ys" heard of it, then other\ncities. Dale Carnegie soon became a glorified circuit\nrider covering New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and\nlater London and Paris. All the textbooks were too academic\nand impractical for the business people who\nflocked to his courses. Because of this he wrote his own\nbook entitled Public Speaking and Influencing Men in\nBusiness. It became the official text of all the Y.M.C.A.s\nas well as of the American Bankers\u2019 Association and the\nNational Credit Men\u2019s Association.\nDale Carnegie claimed that all people can talk when\nthey get mad. He said that if you hit the most ignorant\nman in town on the jaw and knock him down, he would\nget on his feet and talk with an eloquence, heat and\nemphasis that would have rivaled that world famous orator\nWilliam Jennings Bryan at the height of his career.\nHe claimed that almost any person can speak acceptably\nin public if he or she has self-confidence and an idea\nthat is boiling and stewing within.\nThe way to develop self-confidence, he said, is to do\nthe thing you fear to do and get a record of successful\nexperiences behind you. So he forced each class member\nto talk at every session of the course. The audience\nis sympathetic. They are all in the same boat; and, by\nconstant practice, they develop a courage, confidence\nand enthusiasm that carry over into their private speaking.\nDale Carnegie would tell you that he made a living all\nthese years, not by teaching public speaking - that was\nincidental. His main job was to help people conquer\ntheir fears and develop courage.\nHe started out at first to conduct merely a course in\npublic speaking, but the students who came were business\nmen and women. Many of them hadn\u2019t seen the\ninside of a classroom in thirty years. Most of them were\npaying their tuition on the installment plan. They\nwanted results and they wanted them quick - results\nthat they could use the next day in business interviews\nand in speaking before groups.\nSo he was forced to be swift and practical. Consequently,\nhe developed a system of training that is\nunique - a striking combination of public speaking,\nsalesmanship, human relations and applied psychology.\nA slave to no hard-and-fast rules, he developed a\ncourse that is as real as the measles and twice as much\nfun.\nWhen the classes terminated, the graduates formed\nclubs of their own and continued to meet fortnightly for\nyears afterward. One group of nineteen in Philadelphia\nmet twice a month during the winter season for seventeen\nyears. Class members frequently travel fifty or a\nhundred miles to attend classes. One student used to\ncommute each week from Chicago to New York.\nProfessor William James of Harvard used to say that\nthe average person develops only 10 percent of his latent\nmental ability. Dale Carnegie, by helping business men\nand women to develop their latent possibilities, created\none of the most significant movements in adult education\nLOWELL THOMAS\n1936\nTHE DALE CARNEGIE COURSES\nTHE DALE CARNEGIE COURSE IN\nEFFECTIVE SPEAKING AND HUMAN RELATIONS\nProbably the most popular program ever offered in developing\nbetter interpersonal relations, this course is designed to\ndevelop self-confidence, the ability to get along with others\nin one\u2019s family and in social and occupational relations, to\nincrease ability to communicate ideas, to build positive attitudes,\nincrease enthusiasm, reduce tension and anxiety and to\nincrease one\u2019s enjoyment of life.
